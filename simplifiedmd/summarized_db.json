[[0, "Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES)", "Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is a disease of the gastrointestinal system. People who have ZES develop tumors known as gastrinomas in the pancreas and duodenum (the first section of the small intestine). The gastrinomas caused by ZES secrete the hormone gastrin. Approximately 25% to 30% of ZES patients also have a genetic (inherited) disorder known as \"multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1,\" which causes tumors in the pituitary and parathyroid glands. Another complication of ZES is that more than half of single gastrinomas are malignant (cancerous). These malignant gastrinomas can spread to other parts of the body, including the liver, lymph nodes, spleen, bones, or skin. When symptoms do occur, they include: Abdominal pain Burning pain in the abdomen Nausea Diarrhea Weight loss Vomiting Bleeding from the stomach Weakness Fatigue If your doctor suspects that you have ZES, he or she will perform a blood test to look for high levels of gastrin (the hormone secreted by gastrinomas). They may also perform tests to measure how much acid your stomach is producing. This procedure is done with a flexible, lighted tube (an endoscope) that looks at your esophagus, stomach and duodenum. Other tests your doctor might perform include a CT scan, a special type of X-ray that provides cross-sectional images of the body, a PET scan to locate tumors, and an octreotide scan to look for neuroendocrine tumor cells. ZES is treated by reducing the amount of acid your stomach produces. These drugs, which include lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), pantoprazole (Protonix), dexlansoprazole (Dexilant ), esomeprazole (Nexium), and rabeprazole (Aciphex), curb the production of stomach acid and allow the ulcers to heal. If there is metastatic disease, you may be offered a combination of therapies including surgery, chemotherapy, or targeted drug therapy or radiation. If you have been treated for ZES, you should see your doctor on a regular basis to determine if the gastrinomas recur."], [1, "YY Syndrome", "Males normally have one X and one Y chromosome. However, individuals with this syndrome have one X and two Y chromosomes. Additional symptoms may include learning disabilities and behavioral problems such as impulsivity. It was sometimes called the super-male disease because men with this syndrome were thought to be overly-aggressive and lacking in empathy. Although individuals with XYY syndrome have an increased risk for learning disabilities and behavioral problems, they are not overly aggressive, nor are they at an increased risk of any serious mental illness. Because these boys are at a higher risk for having learning disabilities, they may benefit from speech therapy, tutoring, and general awareness of the specific issues they struggle with. Although the first years of school may be more challenging for boys with XYY syndrome, they generally go on to lead full, healthy, and normal lives."], [2, "XXY Males", "Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects males. Klinefelter syndrome occurs when a boy is born with one or more extra X chromosomes. Many men with an extra X chromosome are not aware that they have it, and they lead normal lives. Even though Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic disorder, it is not passed down through families. So, parents who have a child with Klinefelter syndrome are not any more likely than other couples to have another child with the condition. Many men who have Klinefelter syndrome do not have obvious symptoms. Some boys with Klinefelter syndrome have language and learning problems. See a picture of a male with Klinefelter syndrome . Klinefelter syndrome usually is not diagnosed until the time of puberty. To find out if your son has Klinefelter syndrome, your doctor will ask questions about his past health, do a physical exam, and order a chromosome test called a karyotype. In adult men, lab tests in addition to a karyotype may be done, such as hormone tests or a semen analysis, if Klinefelter syndrome is suspected. If you are pregnant and at risk for having a child with Klinefelter syndrome, tests may be done. Klinefelter syndrome can be detected before birth (prenatally) through genetic tests on cells collected from amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Males with Klinefelter syndrome can be given testosterone, a hormone needed for sexual development. If treatment is started around the age of puberty, it can help boys have more normal body development. Speech therapy and educational support can help boys who have language or learning problems. If a man with Klinefelter wants to have children, he may be able to have his sperm collected through testicular sperm extraction (TEST). If your son has been diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome: Recognize your feelings. It is natural for parents to feel that they have done something to cause Klinefelter syndrome. Allow yourself time to deal with your feelings, and talk with your son's doctor about your concerns. Provide education appropriate for his age about Klinefelter syndrome and give him the emotional support and encouragement he needs. Remind him that most men who have Klinefelter syndrome go through life with few problems. If counseling for behavioral problems is needed, or if your son has difficulty reading or has poor verbal skills, get help from qualified professionals who have experience working with boys who have Klinefelter syndrome. Encourage your son to take part in activities to improve his physical motor skills, such as karate, soccer, basketball, baseball, or swimming. Work with your son's teachers, principal, and school administrators. Contact his teachers on a regular basis to compare how he is doing at home and at school.When appropriate, let your son be present for talks with his teachers.

Most people who get it are 65 or older, but it can happen to younger people, too. In the early stages of MDS, you may not realize anything is even wrong. Eventually, you may start to feel very tired and short of breath. But there are a number of treatment options to control symptoms, prevent complications, help you to live longer, and improve the quality of your life. They are: Red blood cells, which carry oxygen in your blood White blood cells of different types, which are key elements of your immune system Platelets, which help your blood to clot Your bone marrow should make the right number of these cells. It makes low numbers of blood cells or defective ones. About 12,000 Americans get different types of myelodysplastic syndrome each year. The chances of getting it become higher as you age. Some other things that raise your chance of getting MDS include: Cancer therapy: You can get this syndrome 1 to 15 years after receiving certain forms of chemotherapy or radiation. You may hear your doctor or nurse call this \"treatment-related MDS.\" You might be more likely to get MDS after treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia in childhood, Hodgkin's disease, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Cancer drugs linked to MDS include: Chlorambucil (Leukeran) Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) Etoposide (Etopophos) Ifosfamide (Ifex) Mechlorethamine (Mustargen) Melphalan (Alkeran) Procarbazine (Matulane) Teniposide (Vumon) Tobacco: Smoking also raises your chance of getting MDS. Benzene: This chemical with a sweet odor is widely used to make plastics, dyes, detergents, and other products. Too much contact with this chemical is linked to MDS. Inherited conditions: Some conditions passed on from your parents increase your chances of having myelodysplastic syndrome. In this condition, the bone marrow fails to make enough of all three types of blood cells. Blood diseases: People with various disease of the blood have a greater chance of getting MDS. They include: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: This life-threatening disorder affects your red blood cells (which carry oxygen), white blood cells (which help fight infection), and platelets (which help your blood clot). Congenital neutropenia: People with this don't have enough of a certain kind of white blood cell, so they easily get infections. But its effect on different types of blood cells can cause warning signs that include: Constant tiredness. This is a common symptom of anemia, caused when you don't have enough red blood cells Unusual bleeding Bruises and tiny red marks under the skin Paleness Shortness of breath when you're exercising or being active Call your doctor if you have these symptoms and concerns about MDS. To figure out whether you have one of the myelodysplastic syndromes, your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and history of other health problems. She might also: Do a physical exam to check for other possible reasons for your symptoms Take a sample of blood to count the different types of cells Get a sample of bone marrow for analysis. She or a technician will insert a special needle into your hip bone or breastbone to remove the sample. Order a genetic analysis of cells from the bone marrow Several conditions are considered to be types of myelodysplastic syndrome. Doctors consider a number of things when figuring out which kind of MDS a person has. These include: How many types of blood cells are affected. In other kinds of MDS, more than 1 type of blood cell is involved. In one type of MDS, the bone marrow is missing a portion of a chromosome. Also called AML, it's when your bone marrow makes too much of a certain type of white blood cell. With most types of MDS, the chance of leukemia is much lower. Your doctor can talk to you about the specific type of myelodysplastic syndrome you have and how it's likely to affect your health and life. Other things that affect your case include: Whether or not the myelodysplastic syndrome developed after earlier cancer treatment How many blasts are found in your bone marrow Your doctor will decide on a treatment for your myelodysplastic syndrome that depends on the type of MDS you have and how severe it is. Your doctor might just want to do regular check-ups if your symptoms are mild and your blood counts are holding up OK. Other times, you might get what your doctor may call a \"low-intensity treatment.\" This treatment tries to stop your immune system from attacking your marrow. That can eventually help you rebuild your blood count. You can get too much iron in your blood if you have a lot of transfusions. These man-made hormones \"encourage\" your bone marrow to make more blood cells. Your doctor will order a series of chemotherapy or radiation sessions to destroy cells in your bone marrow. You'll then get stem cells from a donor. These cells then start to make new blood cells in your body.

The specific symptoms and severity of Schindler disease can vary from one person to another. Schindler disease is caused by mutations of the NAGA gene and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.

Hereditary lymphedema is also known as primary lymphedema. Secondary lymphedema occurs because of damage to the lymphatic system from surgery, radiation therapy, trauma or infection (e.g. Lipedema is frequently misdiagnosed as lymphedema."], [21, "Lymphedema", "One of the causes of lymphedema is surgery to remove lymph nodes , usually during cancer treatment. Normally, lymph nodes filter fluid as it flows through them, trapping bacteria, viruses, and other foreign substances, which are then destroyed by special white blood cells called lymphocytes. Without normal lymph drainage, fluid can build up in the affected arm or leg, and lymphedema can develop. Medicines such as tamoxifen (Nolvadex), radiation therapy, and injury to the lymph nodes can also cause lymphedema. Symptoms of lymphedema include feeling as though your clothes, rings, wristwatches, or bracelets are too tight; a feeling of fullness in your arms or legs; and less flexibility in your wrists, hands, and ankles. Treatment for lymphedema depends on its cause and includes wearing compression garments such as stockings or sleeves, proper diet and skin care, and fluid drainage. Elevating an arm or leg that has swelling can help ease the drainage of lymph fluid from the affected limb. Whenever possible, rest a swollen arm or leg on a comfortable surface, above the level of your heart. Don't put pressure on your armpit or groin area, and don't hold a limb up without support for very long since this can increase swelling. The use of muscles during exercise naturally helps lymph fluid to circulate, which can reduce swelling. But exercise also increases blood flow to the muscles being used, which can increase the amount of lymph fluid present. If you have swelling, it is important to properly bandage an affected limb before exercising. If you have had surgery to remove some lymph nodes, use your affected arm or leg as normally as possible. Most people are healed about 4 to 6 weeks after surgery, and able to go back to their normal activities. If you have had lymph nodes removed or have had radiation therapy as part of cancer treatment, you may be able to avoid lymphedema or keep it under control by following the tips below. If you have had lymph nodes removed from under your arm: Do not have blood drawn from the arm on the side of the lymph node surgery.Do not allow a blood pressure cuff to be placed on that arm. If you are in the hospital, make sure you notify your nurse and other hospital staff of your condition.Use an electric shaver for underarms.Wear gloves when gardening or doing other activities that may lead to cuts on your fingers or hands. Do not allow a blood pressure cuff to be placed on that arm. If you have had lymph nodes removed from your groin: Bathe your feet daily in lukewarm, not hot, water. Ask your doctor how to handle any cuts, scratches, insect bites, or other injuries that may occur. Use sunscreen and insect repellent when outdoors to protect your skin from sunburn and insect bites. Ask your doctor to refer you to a physical therapist who specializes in lymphedema. If you have been diagnosed with lymphedema and plan to travel by air, you'll need to use a compression garment. If you have lymphedema, you may want to wear a lymphedema alert bracelet.

As lymph moves through the lymphatic system, it is filtered by a network of small structures known as lymph nodes that help to remove microorganisms (e.g., viruses, bacteria, etc.) Groups of lymph nodes are located throughout the body, including in the neck, under the arms (axillae), at the elbows, and in the chest, abdomen, and groin. In addition to the lymph nodes, the lymphatic system includes the spleen, which filters worn-out red blood cells and produces lymphocytes, and bone marrow, which is the spongy tissue inside the cavities of bones that manufactures blood cells. There are two main types of lymphocytes: B-lymphocytes (B-cells), which may produce specific antibodies to \"neutralize\" certain invading microorganisms, and T-lymphocytes (T-cells), which may directly destroy microorganisms or assist in the activities of other lymphocytes. AITL results from errors in the production of a T-cell or transformation of a T-cell into a malignant cell. Abnormal, uncontrolled growth and multiplication (proliferation) of malignant T-cells may lead to enlargement of a specific lymph node region or regions; involvement of other lymphatic tissues, such as the spleen and bone marrow; and spread to other bodily tissues and organs.

The heads up would let you start treatment early, when the condition is easier to fight. If your screening shows you may have lung cancer, your doctor will likely order up \"diagnostic\" tests. Those can pinpoint the type of the disease and whether it's spread to other places in the body.

It's a machine that uses X-rays to make detailed pictures of your lungs. One thing to keep in mind: Sometimes an LCDT can give a result that looks like cancer, but really isn't. If your doctor thinks you might have cancer because of your symptoms or your screening test, you may need to take some of these exams: Sputum Cytology. To get a sample, you'll breathe deeply and then cough with enough force to bring some up from your lungs. Your doctor will be able to figure out if the disease has spread, and if so, where in your body it is. Some imaging tests that may be useful to make a diagnosis are: Chest X-ray. It uses radiation in low doses to make images of your lungs. If your doctor sees something that looks like cancer, you might need more exams. If you have the disease, the doctor can see whether it has spread to places like your liver or adrenal glands. It uses a special type of radiation that collects in cancer cells. Your doctor can use this exam to find out if a growth that showed up on an X-ray is really cancer, and to see if it's moved to other places. In this test, your doctor removes some cells from your lungs to check under a microscope for cancer, and to figure out which kind it is. Your doctor numbs your skin and uses a needle to remove a sample of tissue. A procedure that uses a slightly thicker, hollow needle to remove a piece of tissue along with the cells is called a core biopsy. Your doctor may use a CT scan or X-ray to guide the needle to the right spot. For this test, he removes a tissue sample through a thin tube that he places into your lungs.

Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), sometimes called small-cell carcinoma, causes about 10%-15% of all lung cancer. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) causes the rest. There are 2 main types: Small-cell carcinoma (oat cell cancer) Combined small-cell carcinoma Both include many types of cells that grow and spread in different ways. Small-cell lung cancer differs from non-small-cell lung cancer in the following ways: Small-cell lung cancer grows rapidly. Small-cell lung cancer responds well to chemotherapy (using medications to kill cancer cells) and radiation therapy (using high-dose X-rays or other high-energy rays to kill cancer cells). Small-cell lung cancer is frequently associated with distinct paraneoplastic syndromes (a collection of symptoms that result from substances produced by the tumor). The predominant cause of both small-cell lung cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer is tobacco smoking. Those living with a smoker have an almost 30% increase in the risk of developing lung cancer compared to people who are not exposed to secondhand smoke. Exposure to radon (an inert gas that develops from the decay of uranium) has been reported to cause small-cell lung cancer. Persons with small-cell lung cancer typically have had symptoms for a relatively short time (8 to 12 weeks) before they visit their doctor.

During bronchoscopy, the doctor looks for tumors and takes a biopsy (a sample of cells that is removed for examination under a microscope) from the airways.Lung biopsy: If a tumor is on the periphery of the lung, it may not be seen with bronchoscopy. Instead, a biopsy sample has to be taken with the help of a needle inserted through the chest wall and into the tumor. This procedure is called a transthoracic needle biopsy.Mediastinoscopy: This procedure is performed to determine the extent the tumor has spread into the mediastinum (the area of the chest between the lungs). Samples of the lymph nodes (small, bean-shaped structures found throughout the body) are taken from this area to look for cancer cells.

Once the patient has been diagnosed with lung cancer, exams and tests are performed to find out whether the cancer has spread (metastasized) to other organs. Staging is important, because lung cancer treatment is based on the stage of the cancer. Tests used to detect the spread of cancer may include the following: Blood tests: Complete blood count -- CBC -- provides information about the type and count of different types of blood cells, serum electrolytes, kidney function, and liver function. These tests are also important to assess the organ functions before starting treatment.CT scan of the chest and abdomen: An X-ray machine linked to a computer takes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body from different angles. A contrast agent may be given to swallow so that the organs or tissues more clearly show up on the scan.MRI: MRI is an imaging technique used to produce high-quality images of the inside of the body. The difference between an MRI and CT scan is that MRI uses magnetic waves, whereas CT scan uses X-rays for the procedure.Radionuclide bone scan: With the help of this procedure, the doctor determines whether the lung cancer has spread to the bones. If the cancer has spread to the bones, the radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner.PET scan: A small amount of radioactive material is injected into the bloodstream and measures the metabolism of the organs to see if the cancer has spread.Video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS): A doctor will insert a lighted tube with a video camera through small openings in the chest. A biopsy may also be done.Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS): A doctor inserts a flexible tube with a video camera and an ultrasound attached, through your mouth and into your windpipe and lungs. They can look at the lungs and lymph nodes nearby and can take a biopsy of the tissue.

Limited stage: In this stage, the tumor is confined to one side of the chest, the tissues between the lungs, and nearby lymph nodes only.Extensive stage: In this stage, cancer has spread from the lung to other parts of the body. Limited stage: In this stage, the tumor is confined to one side of the chest, the tissues between the lungs, and nearby lymph nodes only. Extensive stage: In this stage, cancer has spread from the lung to other parts of the body. Some of the most commonly used medications for the treatment of persons with small-cell lung cancer are cisplatin, etoposide, vincristine, doxorubicin, irinotecan, topotecan, paclitaxel, docetaxel and cyclophosphamide. Radiotherapy to the chest may be started as early as possible, or it may be given later in the course of treatment. This depends on factors such as the stage of the cancer and the person's overall health. If the patient has limited disease, and has had a very good response to chemotherapy, radiation therapy may be given to the patient's brain to reduce the risk of small-cell lung cancer spreading to the brain. It is usually given after the patient has completed the full chemotherapy, and radiotherapy (to the thorax). Treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (small-cell lung cancer that remains incurable with current treatment options) Persons with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer are treated with combination chemotherapy. Currently, the combination of cisplatin or carboplatin and etoposide (PE) is the most widely used regimen. Radiation therapy may be used for relief of the following symptoms: Bone painCompression of the food pipe (esophagus), windpipe, spinal cord, or superior vena cava caused by tumorsObstructive pneumonia caused by the tumor Bone pain Compression of the food pipe (esophagus), windpipe, spinal cord, or superior vena cava caused by tumors Obstructive pneumonia caused by the tumor Treatment of relapse of small-cell lung cancer Persons who have a relapse of small-cell lung cancer have an extremely poor prognosis. If the disease does not respond to treatment or progresses after initial treatment (called \"refractory disease\") additional treatment may help relieve symptoms and increase survival time somewhat. Other drugs may be given to prevent and treat adverse effects of radiation, chemotherapy, or the cancer itself, such as nausea or vomiting. Pain medications are also important to relieve any pain due to cancer or its treatment. Surgery Surgery plays little, if any, role in the management of small-cell lung cancer, because almost all cancers have spread by the time they are discovered. The exceptions are the relatively small number of people (less than 15%) whose cancer is discovered at a very early stage of the disease, when the cancer is confined to the lung without any spread to the lymph nodes. Radiation can be given from outside the body using a machine (external radiation therapy), or it can be given with the help of radiation-producing materials that are implanted inside the body (brachytherapy). Radiation therapy can be curative (kills all cancer cells), prophylactic (reduces the risk of cancer spreading to the area to which it is given), or palliative (helps reduce suffering). A blood work-up, including CBC (complete blood count), is needed prior to each cycle of chemotherapy to ensure that the bone marrow has recovered before the next dose of chemotherapy is given. The patient will undergo a CT scan to assess their response to treatment Other tests are performed to monitor liver function and electrolytes -- especially sodium and magnesium levels -- due to the effects of the cancer and its treatment. The following organizations can help with palliative and terminal care: National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (800) 658-8898 (Helpline) Hospice Association of America (202) 546-4759 Hospice Net info@hospicenet.org Unlike many other cancers, lung cancer is associated with known risk factors for the disease. The predominant cause of lung cancer is tobacco smoking; therefore, the most important means of preventing lung cancer is to quit smoking. For information about how to quit smoking, visit the following links: American Lung Association, Freedom From Smoking Smokefree.gov Quitnet Other risk factors for lung cancer include asbestos, radon, and uranium exposure. The success of treatment depends on the stage of small-cell lung cancer. Unfortunately, in most people with small-cell lung cancer, the disease has already spread to other organs of the body by the time it is diagnosed. People with small-cell lung cancer in the advanced stage cannot be cured, but treatments are available to improve the quality of life and treat any symptoms of the cancer or its treatment. Support groups and counseling can help you feel less alone and can improve your ability to deal with the uncertainties and challenges that cancer brings. Cancer support groups provide a forum where patients with cancer, survivors of cancer, or both, can discuss the challenges that accompany the illness, as well as guide you in dealing with your concerns.

Risk factors for small cell lung cancer include: Smoking cigarettes, pipes, or cigars now or in the past. When smoking is combined with other risk factors, the risk of lung cancer is increased. Signs and symptoms of small cell lung cancer include coughing, shortness of breath, and chest pain. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by small cell lung cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following: Chest discomfort or pain. Tests and procedures that examine the lungs are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage small cell lung cancer. The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits, including smoking, and past jobs, illnesses, and treatments will also be taken.

Low back pain can happen anywhere below the ribs and above the legs. It is possible to hurt your back when you lift, reach, or twist. In fact, almost everyone has low back pain at one time or another. Causes of low back pain include: Overuse, strain, or injury. Often doctors don't really know what causes low back pain. Depending on the cause, low back pain can cause a range of symptoms. Low back pain can also cause leg symptoms, such as pain, numbness, or tingling, often extending below the knee. Most low back pain is short-term (acute) and will go away in a few weeks. Your doctor will ask questions about your past health, symptoms, and activities. Your answers and the exam can help rule out a serious cause for the pain. In most cases, doctors are able to recommend treatment after the first exam. Tests such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs usually don't help. Most low back pain will improve with basic first aid, which includes continuing to do light activity such as walking, and taking over-the-counter pain medicine as needed. Walking is the simplest and maybe the best exercise for the lower back. Strengthening the muscles in your trunk can improve your posture, keep your body in better balance, and lower your chance of injury. You may need stronger pain medicines, or you might benefit from manual therapy. You may need to try different things to see which work best for you, such as: Spinal manipulation. Having ongoing (chronic) back pain can make you depressed. In turn, depression can have an effect on your level of pain and whether your back gets better. People with depression and chronic pain often benefit from both antidepressant medicines and counseling. Counseling can help you learn stress management and pain control skills. After you've had low back pain, you're likely to have it again. And they can help you get better faster if you do have low back pain again. To help keep your back healthy and avoid further pain: Practice good posture when you sit, stand, and walk. Walk, swim, or ride a stationary bike. When you must lift, learn the right way to lift . If you sit or stand for long periods at work: Sit or stand up straight, with your shoulders back. Make sure your chair fits you and has good back support. Take regular breaks to walk around.

But taking aspirin isn't right for everyone, because it can cause serious bleeding. For people who have never had a heart attack or stroke: Talk to your doctor before you start taking aspirin every day. But aspirin can also cause serious bleeding. And it is not clear that aspirin can help prevent a stroke if you have not already had a heart attack or stroke in the past. You and your doctor can decide if aspirin is a good choice for you based on your risk of a heart attack and your risk of serious bleeding. For help on this decision, see: Aspirin: Should I Take Daily Aspirin to Prevent a Heart Attack or Stroke?. If you think you are having a stroke, do not take aspirin because not all strokes are caused by clots. Gout can become worse or hard to treat for some people who take aspirin. If you take an anticoagulant, such as warfarin (Coumadin), talk with your doctor before taking aspirin, because taking both medicines can cause bleeding problems. Drinking 3 or more alcoholic drinks every day while taking daily aspirin increases your risk for liver damage and stomach bleeding. Before you have a surgery or procedure that may cause bleeding, tell your doctor or dentist that you take aspirin. Do not suddenly stop taking aspirin without talking to your doctor first. Aspirin should not be taken with many prescription and over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, herbal remedies, and supplements. So before you start aspirin therapy, talk to your doctor about all the drugs and other remedies you take. Although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen, relieve pain and inflammation much like aspirin does, they do not affect blood clotting in the same way that aspirin does. Do not substitute NSAIDs for aspirin. If you need both aspirin and an NSAID pain reliever every day, talk to your doctor first. You may be able to use another type of pain reliever, such as acetaminophen, to treat your pain. If you take an NSAID every day, your doctor may recommend that you take the NSAID and aspirin pills at different times. If you take these pills at the same time, aspirin might not work as well to prevent a heart attack or stroke. Do not take the NSAID pill during either the 8 hours before or the 30 minutes after you take aspirin. If you take an NSAID once in a while, it does not seem to cause problems with aspirin. For more safety tips, see Blood Thinners Other Than Warfarin: Taking Them Safely. Your doctor will recommend a dose of aspirin and how often to take it. But your doctor might recommend that you take aspirin every other day. Be sure you know what dose of aspirin to take and how often to take it. Low-dose aspirin (81 mg) is the most common dose used to prevent a heart attack or a stroke. But the dose for daily aspirin can range from 81 mg to 325 mg. One low-dose aspirin contains 81 mg. One adult-strength aspirin contains about 325 mg. For aspirin therapy, do not take medicines that combine aspirin with other ingredients such as caffeine and sodium. Low-dose aspirin seems to be as effective in preventing heart attacks and strokes as higher doses. Take aspirin with food if it bothers your stomach. Aspirin keeps platelets from clumping together, thus helping to prevent or reduce blood clots. When taken during a heart attack, aspirin slows clotting and decreases the size of the forming blood clot."], [33, "Low-Density Beta Lipoprotein Deficiency", "You've noticed that you have a lot of stomach problems, like gas and diarrhea.

Most high or low blood sugar problems can be managed at home by following your doctor's instructions. You can help avoid blood sugar problems by following your doctor's instructions on the use of insulin or diabetes medicines, diet, and exercise. If you have had very low blood sugar, you may be tempted to let your sugar level run high so that you do not have another low blood sugar problem. Children who have diabetes need their parents' help to keep their blood sugar levels in a target range and to exercise safely. Be sure that children learn the symptoms of both high and low blood sugar so they can tell others when they need help. There are many support groups and diabetes education centers to help parents and children understand about blood sugar, exercise, diet, and medicines. If your blood sugar level reads too high or too low but you are feeling well, you may want to recheck your sugar level or recalibrate your blood glucose meter. High blood sugar usually develops slowly over a period of hours to days. If your blood sugar level stays higher than your target range for weeks, your body will adjust to that level, and you may not have as many symptoms of high blood sugar. Unless you don't monitor your blood sugar regularly or you don't notice the symptoms of high blood sugar, you usually will have time to treat high blood sugar so that you can prevent high blood sugar emergencies. Three things can help you prevent high blood sugar problems: Test your blood sugar often, especially if you are sick or are not following your normal routine. You can see when your blood sugar is above your target range, even if you don't have symptoms of high blood sugar such as increased thirst, increased urination, and fatigue. Call your doctor if you have frequent high blood sugar levels or if your blood sugar level is consistently staying above your target range. If your blood sugar continues to rise, your kidneys will increase the amount of urine produced, and you can become dehydrated. Complications of high blood sugar can cause serious problems, including coma and death. Over time, high blood sugar can damage your eyes, heart, kidneys, blood vessels, and nerves. Do not drink alcohol if you have problems recognizing the early signs of low blood sugar. When your blood sugar level drops below 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), you will usually have symptoms of low blood sugar. If your blood sugar level drops just slightly below your target range (mild low blood sugar), you may feel tired, anxious, weak, shaky, or sweaty, and you may have a rapid heart rate. If you have diabetes, you may not always notice symptoms of mild low blood sugar. If your blood sugar level continues to drop (usually below 40 mg/dL), your behavior may change, and you may feel more irritable. You may become too weak or confused to eat something with sugar to raise your blood sugar level. If your blood sugar level drops very low (usually below 20 mg/dL), you may lose consciousness or have a seizure. You may have symptoms of low blood sugar if your blood sugar drops from a high level to a lower level. For example, if your blood sugar level has been higher than 300 mg/dL for a week or so and the level drops suddenly to 100 mg/dL, you may have symptoms of low blood sugar even though your blood sugar is in the target range. But if you have had diabetes for many years, you may not have symptoms of low blood sugar until your blood sugar level is very low. If your doctor thinks you have low blood sugar levels but you are not having symptoms, he or she may ask you to check your blood sugar more often."], [36, "Low Blood Pressure", "Hypotension is the medical term for low blood pressure (less than 90/60). The first and higher of the two is a measure of systolic pressure, or the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats and fills them with blood. In healthy people, low blood pressure without any symptoms is not usually a concern and does not need to be treated. But low blood pressure can be a sign of an underlying problem -- especially in the elderly -- where it may cause inadequate blood flow to the heart, brain, and other vital organs. But health problems can occur when blood pressure drops suddenly and the brain is deprived of an adequate blood supply. Sudden drops in blood pressure most commonly occur in someone who's rising from a lying down or sitting position to standing. This kind of low blood pressure is known as postural hypotension or orthostatic hypotension. Another type of low blood pressure can occur when someone stands for a long period of time. If this does not happen, or happens too slowly, postural hypotension results and can lead to fainting. The risk of both low and high blood pressure normally increases with age due in part to normal changes during aging. In addition, blood flow to the heart muscle and the brain declines with age, often as a result of plaque buildup in blood vessels. It may be associated with the following: Pregnancy Hormonal problems such as an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), diabetes, or low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) Some over-the-counter medications Some prescription medicines such as for high blood pressure, depression or Parkinson's disease Heart failure Heart arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms) Widening, or dilation, of the blood vessels Heat exhaustion or heat stroke Liver disease What Causes a Sudden Drop in Blood Pressure? Causes of this type of hypotension include: Loss of blood from bleeding Low body temperature High body temperature Heart muscle disease causing heart failure Sepsis, a severe blood infection Severe dehydration from vomiting, diarrhea, or fever A reaction to medication or alcohol A severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis that causes an irregular heartbeat Who Gets Postural Hypotension? Postural hypotension, which is low blood pressure when standing up suddenly, can happen to anyone for a variety of reasons, such as dehydration, lack of food, or being overly fatigued. It can also be influenced by genetic make-up, aging, medication, dietary and psychological factors, and acute triggers, such as infection and allergy. Postural hypotension occurs most frequently in people who are taking drugs to control high blood pressure (hypertension). It can also be related to pregnancy, strong emotions, hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), or diabetes. The elderly are particularly affected, especially those who have high blood pressure or autonomic nervous system dysfunction. These medications can be divided into two major categories: Drugs used to treat high blood pressure, such as diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors Drugs that have hypotension as a side effect, including nitrates, erectile dysfunction medications, drugs for Parkinson's disease, antipsychotics, neuroleptics, anti-anxiety agents, sedative-hypnotics, and tricyclic antidepressants Common causes of naturally occurring postural hypotension include: Dehydration and electrolyte loss, which may result from diarrhea, vomiting, excessive blood loss during menstruation, or other conditions Age-associated decline in blood pressure regulation, which may be worsened by certain health conditions or medications Certain diseases can also cause postural hypotension. These include: Central nervous system disorders, such as Shy-Drager syndrome or multiple system atrophy Nerve problems, such as peripheral neuropathy or autonomic neuropathy Cardiovascular disorders Alcoholism Nutritional diseases"], [37, "Low Back Pain Exercises", "Low back pain is very common among adults and is often caused by overuse and muscle strain or injury. Most low back pain can get better if you stay active, avoid positions and activities that may increase or cause back pain, use ice, and take nonprescription pain relievers when you need them. When you no longer have acute pain, you may be ready for gentle strengthening exercises for your stomach, back, and legs, and perhaps for some stretching exercises. Exercise may not only help decrease low back pain, but it may also help you recover faster, prevent reinjury to your back, and reduce the risk of disability from back pain. You should try to be active soon after noticing pain, and gradually increase your activity level. Too little activity can lead to loss of flexibility, strength, and endurance, and then to more pain. Get some type of aerobic exercise, such as walking, every day. Even a couple of minutes will be helpful, and you can gradually increase your time.Choose a couple of stretching and strengthening exercises that you enjoy doing, or vary them from day to day.

Between each one of the vertebra is an intervertebral disk, or band of cartilage serving as a shock absorber between the vertebrae. In addition to performing a complete history and physical exam for your back pain, your doctor may suggest one of the following diagnostic studies: X-rays, which can be used to provide detail of the bone structures in the spine and to check for instability (such as spondylolisthesis, see below), tumors, and fractures CT scans, which can identify specific conditions, such as a herniated disc or spinal stenosis MRI scans, which can provide details about the backs' discs and nerve roots. MRI scans are most commonly used for pre-surgical planning A number of other imaging and electrical studies may also be used to identify back problems, and some injections are used for diagnostic purposes as well as for pain relief. Two main types of back injury include: Spondylolisthesis: This is a slipping of vertebra that occurs, in most cases, at the base of the spine. Spondylolysis, which is a defect or fracture of one or both wing-shaped parts of a vertebra, result in this vertebral slipping backward, forward, or over a bone below. Cervical Radiculopathy: Cervical radiculopathy is the damage or disturbance of nerve function that results if one of the nerve roots near the cervical vertebrae is compressed. Damage to nerve roots in the cervical area can cause pain, weakness, and the loss of sensation in the neck, arms, or shoulders, depending on where the damaged roots are located. A vertebra might be defective from the time a person is born, or a vertebra may be broken by trauma or a stress fracture. Symptoms of spondylolithesis may include: Lower back pain Muscle tightness and stiffness Pain in the buttocks Pain radiating down the legs (due to pressure on nerve roots) Muscle weakness Spondylolisthesis is treated with the strengthening of supportive abdominal and back muscles through physical therapy. Acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, such as ketoprofen (Frotek), ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) may help with pain. For patients who continue to have severe pain and disability despite these treatments, there are options such as decompressive laminectomy, a procedure in which the spinal canal is widened (to provide more room for nerves and a spinal fusion is performed to stabilize the spinal cord), with or without surgical fusion (arthrodesis) of the vertebra, or the use of an implanted device to stabilize the vertebrae in the lower back while permitting more normal movement. In cervical radiculopathy, damage can occur as a result of pressure from material from a ruptured disc, degenerative changes in bones, arthritis, or other injuries that put pressure on the nerve roots. In older people, normal degenerative changes in the discs can cause pressure on nerve roots. Cervical radiculopathy may be treated with a combination of pain medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), or nonsteroidal pain medication such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), ketoprofen (Frotek), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and physical therapy. Steroids may be prescribed either orally or injected epidurally (into the epidural space that surrounds the spinal cord)."], [39, "Louis-Bar Syndrome", "The disorder is characterized by progressively impaired coordination of voluntary movements (ataxia), the development of reddish lesions of the skin and mucous membranes due to permanent widening of groups of blood vessels (telangiectasia), and impaired functioning of the immune system (i.e., cellular and humoral immunodeficiency), resulting in increased susceptibility to upper and lower respiratory infections (sinopulmonary infections). Individuals with AT also have an increased risk of developing certain malignancies, particularly of the lymphatic system (lymphomas), the blood-forming organs (e.g., leukemia), and the brain. Ataxia is often accompanied by difficulty speaking (dysarthria), drooling; and an impaired ability to coordinate certain eye movements (oculomotor apraxia), including the occurrence of involuntary, rapid, rhythmic motions (oscillations) of the eyes while attempting to focus upon certain objects (fixation nystagmus). Affected children may also develop an unusually stooped posture and irregular, rapid, jerky movements that may occur in association with relatively slow, writhing motions (choreoathetosis). In addition, telangiectasias may develop by mid-childhood, often appearing on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the bridge of the nose, the ears, and certain regions of the extremities, as well as the mucous membranes of the eyes (conjunctiva). The disorder is caused by changes (mutations) of a gene known as ATM (for \"AT mutated\") that has been mapped to the long arm (q) of chromosome 11 (11q22.3)."], [40, "Lung Disease/Respiratory Problems Lung Diseases Overview", "Lung diseases are some of the most common medical conditions in the world. Tens of millions of people suffer from lung disease in the U.S. The lungs are part of a complex apparatus, expanding and relaxing thousands of times each day to bring in oxygen and expel carbon dioxide. The trachea (windpipe) branches into tubes called bronchi, which in turn branch to become progressively smaller tubes throughout the lungs. Diseases that affect the airways include: Asthma: The airways are persistently inflamed, and may occasionally spasm, causing wheezing and shortness of breath. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): Lung conditions defined by an inability to exhale normally, which causes difficulty breathing. Emphysema: Lung damage allows air to be trapped in the lungs in this form of COPD. Acute bronchitis: A sudden infection of the airways, usually by a virus. Lung diseases affecting the alveoli include: Pneumonia: An infection of the alveoli, usually by bacteria. Pulmonary edema: Fluid leaks out of the small blood vessels of the lung into the air sacs and the surrounding area. One form is caused by heart failure and back pressure in the lungs' blood vessels; in another form, direct injury to the lung causes the leak of fluid. Lung cancer has many forms, and may develop in any part of the lungs. Most often this is in the main part of the lung, in or near the air sacs. The type, location, and spread of lung cancer determines the treatment options. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Severe, sudden injury to the lungs caused by a serious illness. Life support with mechanical ventilation is usually needed to survive until the lungs recover. Pneumoconiosis: A category of conditions caused by the inhalation of a substance that injures the lungs. The interstitium is the microscopically thin, delicate lining between the lungs' air sacs (alveoli). Tiny blood vessels run through the interstitium and allow gas exchange between the alveoli and the blood. Sarcoidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and autoimmune disease are among the many types of ILD. The right side of the heart receives low-oxygen blood from the veins. Pulmonary embolism (PE): A blood clot (usually in a deep leg vein, deep vein thrombosis) breaks off, travels to the heart, and is pumped into the lungs. The clot lodges in a pulmonary artery, often causing shortness of breath and low blood oxygen levels. Pulmonary hypertension: Various conditions can lead to high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. When no cause is identified, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. The pleura is a thin lining that surrounds the lung and lines the inside of the chest wall. A tiny layer of fluid allows the pleura on the lung's surface to slide along the chest wall with each breath. Lung diseases of the pleura include: Pleural effusion: Fluid collects in the normally tiny pleura space between the lung and the chest wall. Pneumothorax: Air may enter the space between the chest wall and the lung, collapsing the lung. The diaphragm descends with each breath in, also causing chest expansion."], [41, "Lou Gehrig's Disease (Amyotrophic Latera...)", "ALS is short for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. You might also have heard it called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the baseball player who was diagnosed with it in the 1930s. ALS is a progressive disease, which means it gets worse over time. It affects nerves in your brain and spinal cord that control your muscles. As your muscles get weaker, it gets harder for you to walk, talk, eat, and breathe. These nerve cells send messages from your brain to your spinal cord and then to your muscles. You have two main types: Upper motor neurons: Nerve cells in the brain. Lower motor neurons: Nerve cells in the spinal cord. These motor neurons control all your voluntary movements -- the muscles in your arms, legs, and face. They tell your muscles to contract so you can walk, run, pick up your smartphone, chew and swallow food, and even breathe. ALS is one of a few motor neuron diseases. Some others include: primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) progressive bulbar palsy (PBP) pseudobulbar palsy With ALS, motor neurons in your brain and spinal cord break down and die. When this happens, your brain can't send messages to your muscles anymore. At first, your muscles get weak or stiff. Eventually, people with ALS lose control of their diaphragm, the muscles in the chest that help you breathe. The loss of breathing causes many people with ALS to die within 3 to 5 years after they're diagnosed. Yet some people can live more than 10 years with the disease. There are two types of ALS: Sporadic ALS is the most common form. Familial ALS (FALS) runs in families. About 5% to 10% of people with ALS have this type. If one parent has the gene for ALS, each of their children will have a 50% chance of getting the gene and having the disease. Researchers still don't know exactly what causes motor neurons to die with ALS. Gene changes, or mutations, are behind 5% to 10% of ALS cases. This protein may be toxic to motor neurons. Other gene changes in ALS might also damage motor neurons. Environment could also play a role in ALS. For example, people who served in the military during the 1991 Gulf War have gotten ALS at higher rates than usual. Scientists are also looking at these other possible causes: Glutamate. With ALS, glutamate builds up in the spaces around nerve cells and may damage them. Your immune system protects your body from foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. In your brain, microglia are the main type of immune cell. With ALS, microglia might also destroy healthy motor neurons. A problem with them might lead to ALS or make an existing case worse. Some of the oxygen your body uses to make energy may form into toxic substances called free radicals, which can damage cells."], [42, "Loeffler Endomyocardial Fibrosis with Eo...", "Endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF) is a progressive disease of unknown origin (idiopathic) that may seriously affect the heart. Its most obvious feature is a gross change in the makeup of the lining of the heart cavities (the endocardium) of one or both of the lower chambers of the heart (the ventricles) leading to the replacement of normal cells with fibrous tissue (fibrosis). Loeffler's disease is a disease of the heart much like endomyocardial fibrosis.

Lymphatic malformations can affect any area of the body (except the brain), but most commonly affect the head and neck. The specific symptoms and severity of lymphatic malformations varies based upon the size and specific location of the malformation. The lymphatic system functions as part of the immune system and helps to protect the body against infection and disease. Lymph accumulates between tissue cells and contains proteins, fats, and certain white blood cells known as lymphocytes. As lymph moves through the lymphatic system, it passes through a network of lymph nodes that help the body to deactivate sources of infection (e.g., viruses, bacteria, etc.) Groups of lymph nodes are located throughout the body, including in the neck, under the arms (axillae), at the elbows, and in the chest, abdomen, and groin. The lymphatic system includes the spleen, which filters worn-out red blood cells and produces lymphocytes, and bone marrow, which is the spongy tissue inside the cavities of bones that manufactures blood cells. Such terms include cystic hygroma, lymphangioma, cavernous lymphangioma, cystic lymphangioma, and lymphangioma circumscriptum.

Three of the many important functions of the liver are: To filter harmful substances from the blood so they can be passed from the body in stools and urine. The liver is in the upper abdomen near the stomach, intestines, gallbladder, and pancreas. Two lobes are on the front and two small lobes (not shown) are on the back of the liver. Liver cancer is rare in children and adolescents (teenagers). There are two main types of childhood liver cancer: Hepatoblastoma: A type of liver cancer that usually does not spread outside the liver. Hepatocellular carcinoma: A type of liver cancer that often spreads to other places in the body. The treatment of two less common types of childhood liver cancer is also discussed in this summary: Undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma of the liver (UESL) is the third most common liver cancer in children and adolescents. Infantile choriocarcinoma of the liver is a very rare tumor that starts in the placenta and spreads to the fetus. Also, the mother of the child may be diagnosed with choriocarcinoma, which is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease and requires treatment. See the Gestational Trophoblastic Disease Treatment summary for information on the treatment of choriocarcinoma in women. Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is a rare cancer of the blood vessels that occurs in the liver and other organs. This summary is about the treatment of primary liver cancer (cancer that begins in the liver). Treatment of metastatic liver cancer, which is cancer that begins in other parts of the body and spreads to the liver, is not discussed in this summary. Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Risk factors for hepatoblastoma include the following: Having Aicardi syndrome. Having hemihyperplasia (a condition in which one side of the body or a part of one side grows faster than the other). Risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma include the following: Being male. Having one of the following conditions:Biliary cirrhosis.Alagille syndrome.Glycogen storage disease.Progressive familial intrahepatic disease.Tyrosinemia. Signs and symptoms of childhood liver cancer include a lump or pain in the abdomen. Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following: A painless lump in the abdomen. Tests that examine the liver and the blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood liver cancer. The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. Serum tumor marker test: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. The blood of children who have liver cancer may have increased amounts of a hormone called beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (b-hCG) or a protein called alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following: The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells. The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells. The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells. Liver function tests : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver. Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as bilirubin or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that makes it. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) test: A blood test to check for antibodies to the EBV and DNA markers of the EBV. These are found in the blood of patients who have been infected with EBV. Hepatitis assay: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked for pieces of the hepatitis virus. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. In childhood liver cancer, an ultrasound exam of the abdomen is usually done. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. In childhood liver cancer, a CT scan of the chest and abdomen is usually done. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. A pathologist looks at the sample under a microscope to find out the type of liver cancer. The following test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:Immunohistochemistry: A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test is used to check for a certain gene mutation. Immunohistochemistry: A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test is used to check for a certain gene mutation. Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following: The stage of the cancer (the size of the tumor, whether it affects part or all of the liver, and whether it has spread to other places in the body, such as the lungs). Prognosis may also depend on: How the cancer cells look under a microscope. For childhood liver cancer that recurs (comes back) after initial treatment, the prognosis and treatment options depend on: Where in the body the tumor recurred."], [49, "Liver Cancer", "The liver performs many other important functions, such as removing toxins and other chemical waste products from the blood and readying them for excretion. Because all the blood in the body must pass through it, the liver is unusually accessible to cancer cells traveling in the bloodstream. The liver can be affected by primary liver cancer, which arises in the liver, or by cancer which forms in other parts of the body and then spreads to the liver. Most liver cancer is secondary or metastatic, meaning it started elsewhere in the body. Primary liver cancer, which starts in the liver, accounts for about 2% of cancers in the U.S., but up to half of all cancers in some undeveloped countries. This is mainly due to the prevalence of hepatitis, caused by contagious viruses, that predisposes a person to liver cancer. In the U.S., primary liver cancer strikes twice as many men as women, at an average age of 67. Some of these are benign (noncancerous), and some are cancerous and can spread to other parts of the body (metastasize). Liver cancers include: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Cholangiocarcinoma (These are really cancers of the bile duct. Primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) tends to occur in livers damaged by birth defects, alcohol abuse, or chronic infection with diseases such as hepatitis B and C, hemochromatosis (a hereditary disease associated with too much iron in the liver), and cirrhosis. More than half of all people diagnosed with primary liver cancer have cirrhosis -- a scarring condition of the liver commonly caused by alcohol abuse. Hepatitis B and C and hemochromatosis can cause permanent damage and liver failure. Liver cancer may also be linked to obesity and fatty liver disease. Various cancer-causing substances are associated with primary liver cancer, including certain herbicides and chemicals such as vinyl chloride and arsenic. Smoking, especially if you abuse alcohol as well, also increases risk. Obesity can increase the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. In the U.S., liver cancer is most common in Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Male hormones abused by athletes to increase muscle can slightly increase liver cancer risk with long-term use. Studies have suggested a link between diabetes and liver cancer. This is likely due to the link between diabetes and fatty liver disease. Diseases that disrupt the normal metabolism of the body have been shown to increase your risk of liver cancer. Studies have found a link between liver cancer and some rare diseases like alpha -1-antitrypsin deficiency, tyrosinemia, and Wilson's disease."], [50, "Lissencephaly", "Classical lissencephaly, also known as lissencephaly type I, is a brain malformation that may occur as an isolated abnormality (isolated lissencephaly sequence [ILS]) or in association with certain underlying syndromes (e.g., Miller-Dieker syndrome, Norman-Roberts syndrome). Additional abnormalities may include sudden episodes of uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain (seizures), severe or profound intellectual disability, feeding difficulties, growth retardation, and impaired motor abilities. Researchers indicate that there may be various possible causes of isolated lissencephaly, including viral infections or insufficient blood flow to the brain during fetal development or certain genetic factors. Changes (mutations) of at least two different genes have been implicated in isolated lissencephaly: a gene located on chromosome 17 (known as LIS1) and a gene located on the X-chromosome (known as XLIS or Doublecortin)."], [51, "Lipomatosis of Pancreas Congenital", "The disorder is typically characterized by signs of insufficient absorption (malabsorption) of fats and other nutrients due to abnormal development of the pancreas (pancreatic insufficiency) and improper functioning of the bone marrow (bone marrow dysfunction), resulting in low levels of circulating blood cells (hematologic abnormalities). Due to abnormal skeletal changes, individuals with Shwachman syndrome may have abnormal thickening of the ribs and their supporting connective tissue (costochondral thickening), resulting in unusually short, flared ribs. Although malabsorption due to pancreatic insufficiency may itself cause problems with growth and nutrition, short stature appears to be one of the many primary manifestations of Shwachman syndrome. In addition, as a result of bone marrow dysfunction, individuals with Shwachman syndrome may have a decrease in any or all types of blood cells. Therefore, they may have low levels of certain white blood cells (neutropenia), platelets (thrombocytopenia), red blood cells (anemia), and/or all types of blood cells (pancytopenia). Because neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, play an essential role in fighting bacterial infections, many affected individuals are prone to repeated bacterial infections (e.g., recurrent respiratory infections [pneumonia] and infections of the middle ear [otitis media]); in some cases, infections may be severe.

Deficiency of this enzyme prevents affected individuals from properly digesting certain fats and results in massive accumulation of fatty droplets called chylomicrons in the circulation (chylomicronemia) and consequently also an increase of the plasma concentration of fatty substances called triglycerides. Affected individuals often experience episodes of abdominal pain, acute recurrent inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), abnormal enlargement of the liver and/or spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), and the development of skin lesions known as eruptive xanthomas. Familial LPL deficiency is caused by mutations in the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Introduction Chylomicronemia syndrome is a general term for the symptoms that develop due to the accumulation of chylomicrons in the plasma. In the past, familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency has also been called hyperlipoproteinemia type I. Familial LPL deficiency was first described in the medical literature in 1932 by Drs."], [55, "Lip Pseudocleft-Hemangiomatous Branchial...", "Branchio-oculo-facial syndrome (BOFS) is a very rare genetic disorder that is apparent at birth (congenital). As of 2004, only about 50 cases of BOFS had been reported in the medical literature. The symptoms of most BOFS patients include the proliferation of blood vessels (hemangiomatous) in the lower neck or upper chest, low birth weight, retarded growth and some mental retardation. BOFS is characterized by the presence of a pseudocleft of the upper lip resembling a poorly repaired cleft lip, a malformed nose with a broad bridge and flattened tip, blockage of the tear ducts (lacrimal duct obstruction), malformed ears, lumps in the area of the neck or collarbone (branchial cleft sinuses) and/or linear skin lesions behind the ears."], [56, "Limit Dextrinosis", "Forbes disease (GSD-III) is one of several glycogen storage disorders (GSD) that are inherited as autosomal recessive traits. Symptoms are caused by a lack of the enzyme amylo-1,6 glucosidase (debrancher enzyme). This enzyme deficiency causes excess amounts of an abnormal glycogen (the stored form of energy that comes from carbohydrates) to be deposited in the liver, muscles and, in some cases, the heart."], [57, "Lignac-Fanconi Syndrome", "Summary Cystinosis is a rare, multisystem genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of an amino acid called cystine in different tissues and organs of the body including the kidneys, eyes, muscles, liver, pancreas and brain. Generally, cystinosis is broken down into three different forms known as nephropathic cystinosis, intermediate cystinosis and non-nephropathic (or ocular) cystinosis. The age of onset, symptoms, and severity of cystinosis can vary greatly from one person to another. Early detection and prompt treatment is critical in slowing the development and progression of symptoms associated with cystinosis. Cystinosis is caused by mutations of the CTNS gene and is inherited as an autosomal recessive disease. Introduction Cystinosis was first described in the medical literature in 1903 by Abderhalden. The lack of such a specific transporter causes cystine to accumulate in lysosomes in cells throughout the body. Cystine forms crystals (crystallizes) in many types of cells and slowly damages affected organs."], [58, "Lifting properly to prevent back injury", "Plan in your mind for the best way to lift what's in front of you. Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, with one foot slightly ahead of the other (karate stance). If needed, put one knee to the floor and your other knee in front of you, bent at a right angle (half kneeling). Look straight ahead, and keep your back straight, your chest out, and your shoulders back. Slowly lift by straightening your hips and knees (not your back). Keep your back straight, and don't twist as you lift. Hold the load as close to your body as possible, at the level of your belly button. Use your feet to change direction, taking small steps. Set down your load carefully, squatting with the knees and hips only."], [59, "Life Support", "When they fail, special medical procedures, commonly called life support, can keep you alive until your body is ready to take over again. If these systems stop working for any reason, you need life support: Lungs: In cases of near-drowning, pneumonia, drug overdose, a blood clot, and severe lung injury or disease, such as COPD and cystic fibrosis, and muscle or nerve diseases such as ALS and muscular dystrophy Heart: Sudden cardiac arrest or heart attack Brain: Stroke or a severe blow to the head When most people talk about a person being on life support, they're usually talking about a ventilator, which is a machine that helps someone breathe. It's used temporarily for conditions like pneumonia, but it may be needed longer for someone with lung failure. Some people get medicine to make them more comfortable and sleepy while on a breathing machine. When a person's heart stops, doctors will try to restart it. These life support methods include CPR, which keeps blood and oxygen flowing throughout the body, electric shocks (called defibrillation) to get the heart beating again, and medication to help the heart work. Less urgent forms of life support include dialysis to filter toxins from the blood, and a feeding tube or an IV to give nutrition and water. Your medical power of attorney or closest family member, with the right to make decisions for you, turns it down on your behalf. Doctors usually advise stopping life support when there is no hope left for recovery. Choosing to remove life support usually means that the person will die within hours or days. People tend to stop breathing and die soon after a ventilator shuts off, though some do start breathing again on their own. If he is not taking in any fluids, he will usually die within several days of a feeding tube removal, though he may survive for as long as a week or two. When someone is unconscious or not of sound mind, doctors and family members decide when life support measures should stop. It's important to remember that it's the underlying condition, not the removal of life support, that actually causes someone to die, and doctors will do all they can to keep your loved one comfortable."], [60, "Lichen Psoriasis", "Psoriasis is a common skin disorder that forms thick, red, bumpy patches covered with silvery scales. Psoriasis starts as small, red bumps, which grow bigger and form scales. No one knows the exact cause of psoriasis, but experts believe that it's a combination of things. Normally, skin cells are replaced every 10 to 30 days. With psoriasis, new cells grow every 3 to 4 days. Some slow the growth of new skin cells, and others relieve itching and dry skin. Your doctor will select a treatment plan that is right for you based on the size of your rash, where it is on your body, your age, your overall health, and other things. Common treatments include: Steroid creams Moisturizers for dry skin Coal tar (a common treatment for scalp psoriasis; available in lotions, shampoos, and bath solutions) Vitamin D cream (a strong kind ordered by your doctor; vitamin D in foods and pills has no effect) Retinoid creams Treatments for moderate to severe cases of psoriasis include: Light therapy. A doctor uses ultraviolet light to slow the growth of skin cells. PUVA is a treatment that combines a medicine called psoralen with a special form of ultraviolet light. This drug can cause liver disease and lung problems, so it's only for serious cases. You may have to get lab work, a chest X-ray and possibly a liver biopsy. These pills, creams, and gels are a class of drugs related to Vitamin A. Retinoids can cause serious side effects, including birth defects, so they're not recommended for women who are pregnant or planning to have children. This drug, made to suppress the immune system, may be taken for serious cases that do not respond to other treatments. It can damage the kidneys and raise blood pressure though, so your doctor will closely watch your heath while you take it. These work by blocking the body's immune system (which is over-active in psoriasis) to better control the systemic inflammation associated with psoriasis. Biologic medications include adalimumab (Humira), adalimumab-atto (Amjevita), a biosimilar to Humira, brodalumab (Siliq), etanercept (Enbrel), etanercept-szzs (Erelzi), a biosimilar to Enbrel, infliximab (Remicade), ixekizumab (Taltz), secukinumab (Cosentyx), and ustekinumab (Stelara). The medication apremilast (Otezla) is a new kind of drug for long-term inflammatory diseases like psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. It's a pill that works by blocking a specific enzyme, which helps to slow other reactions that lead to inflammation. There's no cure, but treatment greatly reduces symptoms, even in serious cases. Recent studies have suggested that when you better control the inflammation of psoriasis, the risk of heart disease, stroke, metabolic syndrome, and other diseases associated with inflammation also decrease."], [61, "Lichen Planus", "A rash indicates an abnormal change in skin color or texture. There are many types of rashes, including eczema, granuloma annulare, lichen planus, and pityriasis rosea. Eczema is a general term that describes several different conditions in which skin is inflamed, red, scaly, and itchy. Eczema is a common skin condition, and atopic dermatitis (also called atopic eczema) is one of the most common forms of eczema. The cause of atopic eczema is not known, but the condition often affects people with a family history of allergies. Some factors can trigger a flare-up of eczema or make eczema worse, but they do not cause the condition. Eczema triggers include stress, skin irritants (including soaps, skin care products, or some fabrics), allergens, and climate/environment. In adults, eczema occurs most frequently on the hands and elbows, and in \"bending\" areas such as the inside of the elbows and back of the knees. In young children, eczema is often seen on the elbows, knees, face, neck, and scalp. Signs and symptoms of atopic eczema include: Itchiness Skin redness Dry, scaly, or crusted skin that might become thick and leathery from long-term scratching Formation of small, fluid-filled blisters that might ooze when scratched Infection of the areas where the skin has been broken Atopic eczema usually is diagnosed with an analysis of a person's history of symptoms and with an exam of the skin. Atopic eczema can be treated with medications, including over-the-counter creams and ointments containing the steroid hydrocortisone (for example, Cortizone-10, Cort-Aid, Dermarest Eczema, Neosporin Eczema). These products may help control the itching, swelling, and redness associated with eczema. Prescription-strength cortisone creams, as well as cortisone pills and shots, are also used for more severe cases of eczema. For people with mild-to-moderate eczema, topical immunomodulators (TIMs) can help. However, in 2005, the FDA warned doctors to prescribe Elidel and Protopic with caution due to concerns over a possible cancer risk associated with their use. Other drugs that might be used for patients with eczema include antibiotics (to treat infected skin) and antihistamines (to help control itching). The ultraviolet light waves found in sunlight have been shown to benefit certain skin disorders, including eczema. Phototherapy uses ultraviolet light, either ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB), from special lamps to treat people with severe eczema. Risks associated with phototherapy include burning (usually resembling a mild sunburn), dry skin, itchy skin, freckling, and possible premature aging of the skin. Currently, there is no effective strategy for preventing atopic eczema, but the symptoms of the condition can improve. To improve the signs of eczema: Reduce stress Avoid scratchy materials (for example, wool) and chemicals such as harsh soaps, detergents, and solvents Moisturize frequently Avoid sudden changes in temperature or humidity Avoid situations that cause sweating and overheating Granuloma annulare is a chronic skin condition that consists of a circular-shaped rash with reddish bumps (papules). Granuloma annulare is slightly more common in girls and usually is seen in people who are otherwise healthy. People who have granuloma annulare usually notice a ring of small, firm bumps over the backs of the forearms, hands, or feet. The condition is diagnosed by a doctor who may use a skin biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment of granuloma annulare often is not necessary, except for cosmetic reasons. Some doctors may decide to freeze the lesions with liquid nitrogen or to inject steroids directly into the rings of bumps. Lichen planus is a common skin disorder that produces shiny, flat-topped bumps that often have an angular shape and a reddish-purplish color. Lichen planus can occur anywhere on the skin but is often found on the insides of the wrists and ankles, the lower legs, the back, and the neck. Medications to treat high blood pressure, heart disease, and arthritis can cause lichen planus-type rashes that are allergic reactions to those drugs. Signs and symptoms of the condition include shiny, flat-topped bumps that are purple or a reddish-purplish color. Lichen planus of the nails can cause brittle or split nails. A doctor can diagnose lichen planus by its distinctive appearance or with the use of a skin biopsy. In a skin biopsy, a small bit of skin is taken from the affected area and is sent to a lab for testing. Although lichen planus cannot be cured, its symptoms can be treated with anti-itch products such as antihistamines (for example, Benadryl, or diphenhydramine). Drugs such as steroid injections, prednisone, other drugs to suppress the immune system, or retinoids may be prescribed in more severe cases. The condition often begins with a large, scaly, pink patch of skin on the chest or back. However, there is evidence that suggests pityriasis rosea may be caused by a virus because the rash resembles certain viral illnesses. The primary symptom of pityriasis rosea is large, scaly, pink area of skin that is followed by additional skin lesions. The spots become itchy and there may be redness or inflammation of the skin. He or she may order blood tests, scrape the skin, or do a skin biopsy to rule out other skin conditions. Oral antihistamines (for example Benadryl, or diphenhydramine) can help soothe itching."], [62, "Lichen Acuminatus", "Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris is a mildly itchy chronic skin disorder that is possibly caused by an inherited metabolic defect.

Affected children experience several different types of seizures most commonly atonic, tonic and atypical absence seizures. Children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome may also develop cognitive dysfunction, delays in reaching developmental milestones and behavioral problems. Generally, three findings are necessary for the diagnosis: multiple generalized seizure types; a slow spike-and-wave pattern (less than 2.5 Hz); and cognitive dysfunction.

Autosomal dominant LGMD is known as LGMD1 and there are currently recognized eight subtypes (LGMD1A-1H). Autosomal recessive LGMD is known as LGMD2 and has 17 subtypes (LGMDA-Q). Additional terminology has been used in the past to describe forms of muscular dystrophy that are now classified under LGMD. These terms are no longer widely used and include scapulohumeral (Erb) muscular dystrophy, pelvifemoral (Leyden-Mobius) muscular dystrophy, and severe childhood autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy (SCARMD)."], [65, "Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome", "Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a rare and severe kind of epilepsy that starts in childhood. Children with LGS have seizures often, and they have several different kinds of seizures. The seizures usually start between ages 2 and 6. Children with LGS have learning difficulties and developmental delays (like sitting, crawling, walking) that can be moderate to severe. Each child develops differently, and it's impossible to predict how a child with LGS will do. While most children have ongoing seizures and some form of learning disability, some may respond well to treatment and have fewer seizures. Others may continue to have seizures often, as well as problems with thinking, development, and behavior, and will need help with daily living activities. Some parents find that a special diet, called the ketogenic diet, helps. Doctors don't always know what caused a child's LGS. In some cases, it could be caused by: Lack of oxygen during birth Severe brain injuries linked with pregnancy or birth, such as low birth weight or premature birth Brain infections (such as encephalitis, meningitis, or rubella) Seizures that start in infancy, called infantile spasms or West's syndrome A brain problem called cortical dysplasia, where some nerve fibers in the brain don't line up right during development in the womb Tuberous sclerosis, where non-cancerous tumors form in many places throughout the body, including the brain Children with LGS have frequent and severe seizures. And they often have different kinds of seizures, including: Atonic seizures. Also called \"drop attacks,\" because the person loses muscle tone and can fall to the ground. These seizures cause the person's body to stiffen and can last for a few seconds to a minute. During these seizures, a person may have a blank stare or nod their head or blink quickly. In some children, the first sign of LGS is an ongoing seizure that lasts 30 minutes, or continuous seizures without full recovery between them. This is called status epilepticus, and it is a medical emergency. Your doctor will look for three signs to diagnose LGS: Multiple kinds of seizures that are hard to control Developmental delays or intellectual disability An electroencephalogram (EEG) that shows a specific kind of pattern, called a slow spike-wave pattern, between seizures. How do I connect with other families who have children with LGS? The goal is to reduce the number of seizures with medication that causes the fewest side effects. Finding the right treatment for your child will probably take time and close coordination with the doctor. Drugs used to treat seizures include: Clobazam (Onfi) Lamotrigine (Lamictal) Rufinamide (Banzel) Topiramate (Topamax) Valproate, valproic acid (Depakene, Depakote) Usually, no single medication controls seizures completely. Diets A special high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, called the ketogenic diet, helps some people with epilepsy, including some children with LGS. It has to be started in a specific way and followed very strictly, so you need a doctor's supervision. Doctors aren't sure why the ketogenic diet works, but some studies show that children with epilepsy who stay on the diet have a better chance of reducing their seizures or their medications. You don't have to restrict calories, protein, or fluids. Also, you don't weigh or measure foods. People with seizures that are hard to treat have also tried a low glycemic index diet. This diet focuses on the type of carbs, as well as the amount, that someone eats. Medical Marijuana A lot of attention has been focused on using medical marijuana to treat children with epilepsy, and many families are interested in learning more. Doctors haven't yet studied the use of medical marijuana in children who have LGS, and most of the studies using it to treat epilepsy have focused on short-term benefits. According to the Lennox-Gastaut Foundation, more research is needed to find out if this is a safe and effective treatment for children with LGS. Surgery If medications and other treatments aren't reducing the number of seizures, your doctor may suggest surgery. The vagus nerve stimulator is a small device placed in the arm or near the chest. It sends electrical impulses to the vagus nerve, which runs from the abdomen to the brain. The nerve then sends those impulses to the brain to help control seizures. The RNS stimulator is a device that's placed inside the skull and is connected to the brain. It senses any abnormal electrical activity and then sends electrical impulses to the brain to try to keep seizures from happening. Corpus callosotomy divides the left and right hemispheres of the brain. That keeps seizures that start in one part of the brain from spreading to the opposite side. It is usually suggested only for people who have severe, uncontrollable seizures that cause them to fall and get hurt. You may have to deal with behavioral problems like acting out, and side effects from anti-seizure drugs. There is no cure for LGS, although there is a lot of research to find treatments that work better. Some may be able to live independently, but most will need help with daily activities. It's important for parents and siblings to get the support they need as caregivers and family members facing life with this severe condition.

She can tell whether it's a harmless lipoma or something that needs more tests. In rare cases, they form inside the body, in muscles or internal organs. In very rare cases, a lump may be a type of cancer called a liposarcoma, which grows rapidly and can be painful. If your doctor suspects this condition, she will most likely ask you to have more tests. Since lipomas aren't harmful, many times your doctor will leave them alone. You may be asked to keep an eye on it between visits. If one hurts or you don't like the way it looks, you might want to have it removed. Your doctor can take it out surgically with a small cut. You are given a shot of medication to numb the area so it won't hurt. In almost all cases, people are able to go home after it's done. You may have to go back within a couple of weeks to get a few stitches taken out. Other possible treatments include: Steroids: Sometimes, this type of drug can be used to shrink a tumor. Liposuction: A doctor uses a needle and syringe to draw out the fatty tissue Lipomas bigger than 2 inches are sometimes called \"giant lipomas.\" You most likely would need to be given something that will make you sleep during the procedure.

When your child's brain gets both a blurry image and a clear one, it starts to ignore the blurry one. If this goes on for months or years in a young child, vision in the blurry eye will get worse. Sometimes a child's eyes don't line up like they should. The doctor will call this strabismus, and it can also lead to amblyopia. Kids who have it can't focus their eyes together on an image, so they often see double. If your child has it, her brain will ignore the image from the eye that isn't aligned. Vision in that eye will get worse. It's this misalignment that led to the term \"lazy eye.\" Some kids can't see well out of one eye because something is blocking light from getting through. Your child's doctor or the vision program at school will check to make sure that: Nothing blocks the light coming into her eyes. If there's any problem, the doctor or school nurse may suggest you take her to an eye specialist. If you feel something's wrong with your child's vision -- even if nothing shows up at the vision check -- make an appointment with a pediatric eye doctor. If amblyopia runs in your family, your child is more likely to get it. The most common method is to force your child's brain to start using the weak eye. First, the doctor will correct any underlying problems in that eye, like nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. If a cataract is blocking light from her eye, the doctor may recommend surgery to remove it. Her vision will get better, though it might take weeks or months for that to happen. After the doctor says her vision is back to normal, she won't have to wear the patch all the time. But sometimes when kids go back to using both eyes, they lose some vision in the weak eye. It blurs the strong eye so your child won't need to wear a patch. If strabismus prevents her eyes from moving together like they should, your doctor might recommend surgery on her eye muscles. Amblyopia becomes much harder to treat after about 7-9 years of age, so make sure your child gets eye exams early on.

Food such as bran or products such as Citrucel, Metamucil, Fibercon, or Perdiem ease constipation by absorbing more fluid in the intestines. Regular use of bulking agents is safe and often lets you have more stools. Products such as Colace lubricate and soften the stool in the intestine, making it easier to pass. Products such as Fleet Phospho-Soda, Milk of Magnesia, or Miralax and nonabsorbable sugars such as lactulose or sorbitol hold fluids in the intestine and draw fluids into the intestine from other tissue and blood vessels. This extra fluid in the intestines makes the stool softer and easier to pass. Products such as Correctol, Dulcolax, Ex-Lax, Feen-a-Mint, or Senokot speed up how fast a stool moves through the intestines by irritating the lining of the intestines. Stimulant laxatives change the tone and feeling in the large intestine and you can become dependent on using laxatives all the time to have a bowel movement.

Coming in contact with latex and rubber products over and over may be part of the reason why it happens. About 5% to 10% of health care workers have some form the allergy. Other people who are more likely than most people to get it include those who have: A defect in their bone marrow cells A deformed bladder or urinary tract Had more than one operation A urinary catheter, which has a rubber tip Allergy, asthma, or eczema Food allergies to bananas, avocados, kiwis, or chestnuts Rubber industry workers and people who use condoms are also more likely than others to get a latex allergy. You can get exposed to latex: Through the skin, such as when you wear latex gloves Through mucous membranes, such as the eyes, mouth, vagina, and rectum Through inhalation. This can happen when some medical devices containing rubber are used. There are three types of latex reactions: 1. It usually happens due to repeated exposure to chemicals in latex gloves and leads to dryness, itching, burning, scaling, and skin problems. But the reaction is more severe, spreads to more parts of the body, and lasts longer. Symptoms can start up to 4 days after you've come in contact with latex. It can show up as a nasal allergy with hay fever-like symptoms, conjunctivitis (pink eye), cramps, hives, and severe itching. It's rare, but symptoms may also include rapid heartbeat, tremors, chest pain, trouble breathing, low blood pressure, or anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction that can be life-threatening. If you have severe symptoms, call your doctor or 911 immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Doctors diagnose a latex allergy in people who: Have had symptoms of an allergic reaction -- like a skin rash, hives, eye tearing or irritation, wheezing, itching, or trouble breathing -- when exposed to latex or a natural rubber product Are known to be at risk for a latex allergy and blood or skin tests show that they have it, even if they haven't had symptoms. If you need a skin test to check on a latex allergy, an allergy specialist must supervise it, in case you have a severe reaction. If your reaction is severe, you may need epinephrine, IV fluids, and other emergency medical care. If you have a latex allergy, wear a MedicAlertbracelet or another type of ID in case of an emergency.

When lactose moves through the large intestine (colon) without being properly digested, it can cause uncomfortable symptoms such as gas, belly pain, and bloating. Some people who have lactose intolerance cannot digest any milk products. Others can eat or drink small amounts of milk products or certain types of milk products without problems. Lactose intolerance is common in adults. It occurs more often in Native Americans and people of Asian, African, and South American descent than among people of European descent. A big challenge for people who are lactose-intolerant is learning how to eat to avoid discomfort and to get enough calcium for healthy bones. Lactose intolerance occurs when the small intestine does not make enough of an enzyme called lactase. Your body needs lactase to break down, or digest, lactose. Lactose intolerance most commonly runs in families, and symptoms usually develop during the teen or adult years. Most people with this type of lactose intolerance can eat some milk or dairy products without problems. Or the small intestine sometimes stops making lactase after surgery to remove a part of the small intestine. In these cases, the problem can be either permanent or temporary. After a baby begins to make lactase, the condition typically goes away. Symptoms of lactose intolerance can be mild to severe, depending on how much lactase your body makes. If you have lactose intolerance, your symptoms may include: Bloating. Many people who have gas, belly pain, bloating, and diarrhea suspect they may be lactose-intolerant. If they do, then you can try adding small amounts of milk products to see if your symptoms come back. If you feel sick after drinking a glass of milk one time, you probably do not have lactose intolerance. But if you feel sick every time you have milk, ice cream, or another dairy product, you may have lactose intolerance. Sometimes people who have never had problems with milk or dairy products suddenly have lactose intolerance. If you think you might have lactose intolerance, talk with your doctor. He or she can make sure that your symptoms are caused by lactose intolerance and not by another problem. Some people use milk with reduced lactose, or they substitute soy milk and soy cheese for milk and milk products. Some people who are lactose-intolerant can eat yogurt without problems, especially yogurt with live cultures. In time, most people who have lactose intolerance get to know their bodies well enough to avoid symptoms. One of the biggest concerns for people who are lactose-intolerant is making sure they get enough of the nutrients found in milk products, especially calcium. Calcium is most important for children, teens, pregnant women, and women after menopause. There are many nondairy foods that contain calcium, including: Broccoli, okra, kale, collards, and turnip greens. Calcium-fortified soy products such as soy milk, tofu, and soybeans. What foods other than milk are high in calcium?"], [76, "Laryngeal cancer: Treatment - Patient In...", "The sound echoes through the pharynx, mouth, and nose to make a person's voice. There are three main parts of the larynx: Supraglottis: The upper part of the larynx above the vocal cords, including the epiglottis. Subglottis: The lower part of the larynx between the vocal cords and the trachea (windpipe). The three parts of the larynx are the supraglottis (including the epiglottis), the glottis (including the vocal cords), and the subglottis. Most laryngeal cancers form in squamous cells, the thin, flat cells lining the inside of the larynx. Use of tobacco products and drinking too much alcohol can affect the risk of laryngeal cancer. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following: A sore throat or cough that does not go away. Tests that examine the throat and neck are used to help detect (find), diagnose, and stage laryngeal cancer. The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam of the throat and neck: An exam to check the throat and neck for abnormal areas. The doctor will feel the inside of the mouth with a gloved finger and examine the mouth and throat with a small long-handled mirror and light. This will include checking the insides of the cheeks and lips; the gums; the back, roof, and floor of the mouth; the top, bottom, and sides of the tongue; and the throat. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and medical treatments will also be taken. Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The sample of tissue may be removed during one of the following procedures:Laryngoscopy: A procedure to look at the larynx (voice box) for abnormal areas. A mirror or a laryngoscope (a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing) is inserted through the mouth to see the larynx. A special tool on the laryngoscope may be used to remove samples of tissue.Endoscopy: A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body, such as the throat, esophagus, and trachea to check for abnormal areas. An endoscope (a thin, lighted tube with a light and a lens for viewing) is inserted through an opening in the body, such as the mouth. A special tool on the endoscope may be used to remove samples of tissue. Laryngoscopy: A procedure to look at the larynx (voice box) for abnormal areas.

GHI can be caused by mutations in the growth hormone receptor (GHR) gene or mutations in genes involved in the action pathway within the cell after growth hormone binds to its receptor, preventing production of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), the substance responsible for the growth effects of growth hormone. Even more rarely, children with GH gene deletion who have been treated with recombinant GH develop antibodies that block GH binding to its receptor. IGF-I insensitivity due to IGF-I receptor mutation mimics GHI, but results in less severe growth deficiency and is somewhat responsive to treatment with recombinant GH. GHI is characterized by short stature and delayed bone age, as well as normal or high levels of circulating GH. Except for an extremely rare form of GHI, where the gene for IGF-I is defective, brain development is normal, apparently because IGF-I can be made during fetal life without GH stimulation in the other conditions. The molecular basis for the syndrome he described, genetic mutation of the GHR in some of the Israeli patients was initially described in 1989, and since then over 40 different mutations of this protein have been identified by many investigators.

Neurological abnormalities that can be associated with ENSs can include seizures, cognitive impairment, developmental delays and paralysis of one side of the body (hemiparesis). Skeletal abnormalities can include abnormal curvature of the spine, malformation of the hip and abnormalities of the arms and legs (e.g., underdevelopment or absence or overgrowth of limbs). Ocular abnormalities may include cataracts, clouding (opacity) of the cornea or partial absence of tissue of the iris or retina (colobomas). Most ENSs occur randomly for no apparent reason (sporadically), most likely due to a gene mutation that occurs after fertilization (postzygotic mutation) and is present in only some of the cells of the body (mosaic pattern). The term \"epidermal nevus syndrome\" has generated significant controversy and confusion in the medical literature. Originally, the term was used to denote a disorder that was actually several different disorders erroneously grouped together. However, the term epidermal nevus syndrome could be correctly applied to several different disorders. Therefore, the umbrella term \"epidermal nevus syndromes\" now represents a group of distinct disorders that have in common the presence of one of the various types of epidermal nevi. This report follows the classification from a review by Happle (J Am Acad Dermatol 2010).

The inflammation may cause sudden vertigo. Labyrinthitis may also cause temporary hearing loss or a ringing sound in your ears. Your doctor may also call this vestibular neuritis. Labyrinthitis can happen after a viral infection or, more rarely, after an infection caused by bacteria. It is often triggered by an upper respiratory infection, such as the flu or a cold. This causes the nerve to send incorrect signals to the brain that the body is moving. The confusion in signals can make you feel that the room is spinning or that you have lost your balance (vertigo). But vertigo makes you feel like you're spinning or whirling. Symptoms of vertigo and dizziness may be caused by many problems other than labyrinthitis. It often starts 1 to 2 weeks after you've had the flu or a cold. It may be severe enough to make you vomit or make you feel sick to your stomach. But for a month or longer, you may still get vertigo symptoms if you suddenly move your head a certain way. Labyrinthitis may also cause hearing loss and a ringing sound in your ears (tinnitus). Your doctor can tell if you have labyrinthitis by doing a physical exam and asking about your symptoms and past health. If the cause of your vertigo is not clear, your doctor may do other tests, such as electronystagmography or an MRI to rule out other problems. If the cause is a bacterial infection, your doctor will give you antibiotics. But most cases are caused by viral infections, which can't be cured with antibiotics. Your doctor may prescribe steroid medicines, which may help you get better sooner. He or she may also give you other medicines, such as antiemetics, antihistamines, and sedatives, to help control the nausea and vomiting caused by vertigo. Medicines like antihistamines can help your symptoms, but they may make it take longer for vertigo to go away. It's best to only use medicines when they are needed and for as little time as possible. They may reduce symptoms of vertigo."], [87, "Labor and Delivery Complications", "Here are some of the most common concerns: Preterm Labor and Premature Delivery One of the greatest dangers a baby faces is being born too early, before his or her body is mature enough to survive outside the womb. Also, a baby born before 37 weeks is considered a premature baby who is at risk of complications of prematurity, such as immature lungs, respiratory distress, and digestive problems. Prolonged Labor (Failure to Progress) A small percentage of women, mostly first-time mothers, may have a labor which lasts too long, sometimes called \"failure to progress.\" Both the mother and the baby are at risk for several complications, including infections, if the amniotic sac has been ruptured for a long time and the birth doesn't follow. Abnormal Presentation \"Presentation\" refers to the part of the baby that will appear first from the birth canal. Ideally, for labor, the baby is positioned head-down, facing the mother's back, with its chin tucked to its chest and the back of the head ready to enter the pelvis. That way, the smallest part of the baby's head leads the way through the cervix and into the birth canal. Because the head is the largest and least flexible part of the baby, it's best for the head to lead the way into the birth canal. Breech presentations are often seen during an ultrasound exam far before the due date, but most babies will turn to the normal head-down presentation as they get closer to the due date. In a complete breech, both knees and hips are flexed, and the baby's buttocks or feet may enter the birth canal first. A few babies lie horizontally in the uterus, called a transverse lie, which usually means the baby's shoulder will lead the way into the birth canal rather than the head. In cephalopelvic disproportion, the baby's head is too large to fit through the mother's pelvis, either because of the size or because of the baby's poor positioning. Sometimes the baby is not facing the mother's back, but instead is turned toward her abdomen (occiput or cephalic posterior). This increases the chance of a lengthy, painful, childbirth, often called \"back labor,\" or tearing of the birth canal. In malpresentation of the head, the baby's head is positioned wrong, with the forehead, top of the head, or face entering the birth canal, instead of the back of its head. Breech babies are at an increased risk of injury and a prolapsed umbilical cord, which cuts off the baby's blood supply. A transverse lie is the most serious abnormal presentation, and it can lead to injury of the uterus, as well as injury to the fetus. When a baby is in the breech position before the last six to eight weeks of pregnancy, the odds are still good that the baby will change position before birth. But the bigger the baby gets, and the closer you get to your due date, the less room there is in the uterus for the baby to turn. Premature Rupture of Membranes (PROM) Normally, the membranes surrounding the baby in the uterus break and release amniotic fluid (known as the \"water breaking\") either right before or during labor. Premature rupture of membranes means that these membranes have ruptured too early in pregnancy, meaning prior to the onset of labor. Sometimes, before or during labor, the umbilical cord can slip through the cervix after your water breaks, preceding the baby into the birth canal. You may feel the cord in the birth canal if it prolapses, and may see the cord if it protrudes from your vagina. Umbilical Cord Compression Because the fetus moves and kicks inside the uterus, the umbilical cord can wrap and unwrap itself around the baby many times throughout pregnancy. While there are \"cord accidents\" in which the cord gets twisted around and blocks blood supply to the baby, this is extremely rare and can't be prevented. Sometimes the umbilical cord gets stretched and compressed during labor, leading to a brief decrease in blood flow to the fetus. In most cases, these heart rate changes are of no major concern, and the birth proceeds normally. But a C-section may be necessary if the baby's heart rate worsens or the baby shows other signs of distress. Amniotic Fluid Embolism This is one of the most serious complications of labor and delivery. Very rarely, a small amount of amniotic fluid -- the fluid that surrounds the fetus in the uterus -- enters the mother's bloodstream, usually during a particularly difficult labor or a C-section. The fluid travels to the woman's lungs and may cause the arteries in the lungs to constrict. For the mother, this constriction can result in a rapid heart rate, irregular heart rhythm, collapse, shock, or even cardiac arrest and death. Preeclampsia may lead to premature detachment of the placenta from the uterus, maternal seizure, or stroke. Uterine Bleeding (Postpartum Hemorrhage) After a baby is delivered, excessive bleeding from the uterus, cervix, or vagina, called postpartum hemorrhage, can be a major concern. Excessive bleeding may result when the contractions of the uterus after delivery are impaired, and the blood vessels that opened when the placenta detached from the wall of the uterus continue to bleed. The risks can become significant in post-term pregnancies, those that go to 42 weeks or more."], [88, "Labor and Delivery", "If you are pregnant, one of your first concerns might be what labor and delivery are like. This information will help answer the most common questions about labor, especially if this is your first pregnancy. No one knows what causes labor to start or when it will start, but several hormonal and physical changes may indicate the beginning of labor: Lightening Passing of the mucus plug Contractions Water breaking Effacement and dilation of the cervix The process of your baby settling or lowering into your pelvis just before labor is called lightening. Because the uterus rests on the bladder more after lightening, you may feel the need to urinate more frequently. When the cervix begins to open wider, the mucus is discharged into the vagina and may be clear, pink, or slightly bloody. Labor may begin soon after the mucus plug is discharged or one to two weeks later. The way a contraction feels is different for each woman, and may feel different from one pregnancy to the next. But labor contractions usually cause discomfort or a dull ache in your back and lower abdomen, along with pressure in the pelvis. Unlike false labor contractions or Braxton Hicks contractions, true labor contractions do not stop when you change your position or relax. Although the contractions may be uncomfortable, you will be able to relax in between contractions. Before \"true\" labor begins, you may have \"false\" labor pains, also known as Braxton Hicks contractions. These irregular uterine contractions are perfectly normal and may start to occur in your second trimester, although more commonly in your third trimester of pregnancy. When you think you are in true labor, start timing your contractions. To do this, write down the time each contraction starts and stops or have someone do it for you. The time between contractions includes the length or duration of the contraction and the minutes in between the contractions (called the interval). Active labor (the time you should come into the hospital) is usually characterized by strong contractions that last 45 to 60 seconds and occur three to four minutes apart. The first stage of labor (called the Latent Phase) is best experienced in the comfort of your home. If your \"water breaks,\" write down the time this occurs, how much fluid is released, and what the fluid looks like, and then notify your health care provider. Lastly, keep in mind that not all women will have their water break when they are in labor. During labor, your cervix gets shorter and thins out in order to stretch and open around your baby's head. The shortening and thinning of the cervix is called effacement. Your health care provider will be able to tell you if there are changes to the cervix during a pelvic exam. When the cervix is half the normal thickness, it is 50% effaced. When the cervix is completely thinned out, it is 100% effaced. The stretching and opening of your cervix is called dilation and is measured in centimeters, with complete dilation being at 10 centimeters. Effacement and dilation are a direct result of effective uterine contractions. Progress in labor is measured by how much the cervix has opened and thinned to allow your baby to pass through the vagina. When you suspect you are in true labor, call your health care provider. Your health care provider will give you specific guidelines about when you should get ready to come to the hospital."], [89, "Laryngotracheobronchitis", "Croup is a condition that irritates your baby's upper airways and causes them to swell. As the airway below his vocal cords becomes narrow, your baby will find it hard to breathe. His breathing will be noisy and he'll have a cough that sounds a lot like a high-pitched seal or dog bark. His voice will also sound raspy and hoarse, especially when he cries. The condition is contagious, especially in the first few days or until your child's fever is gone. Viral croup is caused by any virus that infects the voice box (larynx) and windpipe (trachea). He also may make a high-pitched, wheezing sound in his lower airway when he breathes in. The croup sound in the upper airway is a harsh, loud sound known as \"stridor.\" Spasmodic croup comes on suddenly, often in the middle of the night. That happens when contents from your baby's stomach move back up into his esophagus. No matter which type of croup it is, any time your child has difficulty breathing, retractions (when his skin pulls tight around his ribs), or stridor at rest, immediate medical attention is needed. Stridor when crying, agitated, or playing, or a barky cough is not an emergency.

The inflammation can cause redness, swelling, warmth, and soreness in the joints. The condition can affect any joint, and it may limit how well that joint works. Most children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis recover fully. With the right treatment, they're likely to do well and live a normal life. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder. But studies show that by adulthood, children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis don't have symptoms anymore. Besides joint pain, it may cause chronic fever and anemia, which is a shortage of red blood cells. It can also affect the heart, lungs, eyes, and nervous system. They include: Fevers of 103 F or higher Pink rash that comes and goes Eye inflammation Joint pain or stiffness Limping Swelling in joints Being less active Trouble with movements of hands or fingers, affecting things like handwriting or coloring Problems with bone development and growth There are three kinds. Each type is based on the number of joints involved, the symptoms, and certain antibodies that may be in the blood. They are more likely to get eye diseases like iritis, which is inflammation of the iris, or colored part of the eye. They can also get uveitis, which is inflammation of the inner eye. Still, eye problems can continue, and joint symptoms may come back. It usually affects the small joints, like those in the hands and feet, but it can sometimes involve the large joints. This type of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is usually symmetrical. Signs of this include joint swelling, fever, and a light pink rash. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is often hard to diagnose. Some symptoms are similar to other serious conditions like infections, cancer, bone disorders, Lyme disease, and lupus. If a doctor thinks a child may have juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, she will ask about symptoms and the family's medical history. She will give the child a physical exam to look for joint swelling, rashes, signs of internal organ inflammation, and eye problems. She may also take samples of the child's blood and joint fluid, and use X-rays or other tests. The goals are to: Stop inflammation Ease pain and swelling Strengthen joints and help them move better Prevent joint damage and other complications Medications for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis include: NSAIDS (Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) The medicines can curb pain, fever, and inflammation. Some common NSAIDs are aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and tolmetin. While NSAIDs ease pain and inflammation, they also have side effects. These include stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, and anemia. Sometimes your doctor will give you another stomach-protecting medication to take with the NSAIDs. If you child does not respond well to NSAIDS, the doctor may prescribe a new drug called Xatmep. Xatmep is the first ready-to-use oral solution formulation of methotrexate to be approved for use in children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. An aggressive therapy, this medicine helps reduce further joint damage and helps preserve joint function. Side effects can include dizziness, fatigue, chills and fever. Meds That Stop the Condition From Getting Worse Your doctor may prescribe \"DMARDs,\" which stands for Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs. They also help with joint stiffness, pain, and swelling. Examples include hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), methotrexate, and sulfasalazine (Azulfidine). Because these are strong drugs, your child will need frequent tests to check for side effects. They can include anemia, low blood count, and kidney and liver problems. \"Biologic\" Drugs for Your Immune System These drugs are genetically engineered to work on the immune system. They include adalimumab (Humira), adalimumab-atto (Amjevita), a biosimilar to Humira, anakinra (Kineret), etanercept (Enbrel), etanercept-szzs (Ereizi), a biosimilar to Enbrel, infliximab (Remicade), and infliximab-dyyb (Inflectra), a biosimilar to Remicade. If you take them, you are more likely to get an infection, including serious diseases like tuberculosis. If You Need Corticosteroids These are strong, anti-inflammatory drugs. Doctors usually prescribe them only if other treatments don't work, or if the condition is severe. Corticosteroids come in pills or liquids, and are usually prescribed for short periods of time and in low dosages. Exercise and physical activity are important for children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Movement brings less pain, builds strength, and keeps joints moving well. With the help of physical and occupational therapists, children learn simple ways to do everyday things. It can help to use hot and cold treatments. For instance, a warm compress can loosen up a stiff muscle and an ice pack often reduces swelling and inflammation. Therapists can also make splints for children to correctly position their joints and reduce pain. If your child has juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, encourage her to get out there and be active. Avoid contact sports and instead go for things that are not stressful on the joints, like swimming. Eye problems are linked to some forms of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, so keep up with your child's eye tests. The condition can also cause problems with oral health if it affects the jaw and makes it hard to brush and floss teeth. Dentists can recommend special toothbrushes and floss to help children take care of their mouths. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) or jaw pain sometimes happens with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Certain exercises can help with jaw pain and stiffness."], [92, "Johnson-Stevens Disease", "Until recently the relationship of Stevens-Johnson syndrome to other severe blistering disorders was a matter of some debate.

Patients diagnosed with TEN can present with symptoms ranging from 10% skin involvement and severe threat to the patient's sight to a presentation involving 90% of the skin but only a modest threat to the patient's sight. SJS (and TEN) is an inflammatory disorder of the skin triggered by an allergic reaction to certain drugs including antibiotics, such as some sulfonamides, tetracycline, amoxicillin, and ampicillin.

It is a fungal infection of the outer layers of skin, hair, or nails. Ringworm of the skin appears as a rash with patches that may be red or peeling or that have bumps on the edges that look like blisters. The skin often is itchy, and the rash can spread quickly. You can have both jock itch and athlete's foot (tinea pedis) at the same time. Fungi commonly grow on or in the top layer of skin. Fungi grow best in warm, moist areas of the body such as the groin, inner thighs, and buttocks. As the name suggests, jock itch mostly affects male athletes, but anyone can get it. Using public showers and locker rooms increases your chances of getting jock itch. So it's not surprising that jock itch and athlete's foot often occur at the same time, since both are caused by fungi. Symptoms of jock itch include the following: Itching and pain are common. The edge of the rash is very distinct and may be scaly or have bumps that look like blisters. Jock itch is annoying, but it usually is not serious. If you have had jock itch in the past, you may recognize the symptoms. Your doctor can tell if you have jock itch after asking questions about your symptoms and past health and by looking at your rash. Your doctor may scrape a little of the rash on a glass slide so that he or she can look at it under a microscope. Most ringworm infections of the skin, such as jock itch, can be treated at home with antifungal creams and powders you can buy without a prescription. To treat jock itch, follow these steps: Wash the rash with soap and water. Use an antifungal cream or powder that contains terbinafine, miconazole, or clotrimazole. In rare cases, ringworm of the skin causes large areas of blisters. If your ringworm forms blisters, you can use compresses (such as Burow's compress, which you can buy without a prescription) to soothe and dry out the blisters. After the skin is dried out, use antifungal creams that you can buy without a prescription.

The word for having too much bilirubin in the blood is hyperbilirubinemia (say \"hy-per-bil-ih-roo-bih-NEE-mee-uh\"). Many babies have left the hospital by the time jaundice starts. It usually gets better or goes away on its own within a week or two without causing problems. In rare cases, if the bilirubin level stays high and isn't treated, it can cause brain damage called kernicterus. Bilirubin is a yellow substance that's made when the body breaks down old red blood cells. After birth, your baby's body must get rid of the bilirubin on its own. In most cases, babies have what's called physiologic jaundice. It gets worse until the third or fourth day, and then it goes away in about a week. In rare cases, jaundice may be caused by other things, such as an infection, a problem with the baby's digestive system, or a problem with the mom's and baby's blood types (Rh incompatibility). Your baby may have one of these problems if jaundice appears less than a day after birth. If a newborn has jaundice, his or her skin and the white part of the eyes will look yellow. The yellow color shows up first in the baby's face and chest, usually 1 to 5 days after birth. Your baby's doctor will do a physical exam and ask you questions about your health and your baby's health. For example, the doctor might ask if you and your baby have different blood types. The doctor may place a device against your baby's skin to check your baby's bilirubin level. A blood test for bilirubin may be done to find out if your baby needs treatment. More tests may be needed if the doctor thinks that a health problem is causing too much bilirubin in the blood. He or she will be put under a type of fluorescent light to treat the jaundice. Don't try to treat jaundice by placing your baby in the sun or near a window. If a health problem caused the jaundice, your baby may need other treatment. For example, a baby with severe jaundice caused by Rh incompatibility may need a blood transfusion. If your baby has jaundice, you have an important role to play. Look closely at your baby's skin 2 times a day to make sure that the color is returning to normal. The best thing you can do to reduce jaundice is to make sure that your baby gets enough to eat. That will help your baby's body get rid of the extra bilirubin. If you are feeding your baby from a bottle, stay on your schedule (usually about 6 to 10 feedings every 24 hours). If you aren't sure that your baby is getting enough milk, ask your doctor, a nurse, or a lactation consultant for help."], [100, "Lactation Mastitis", "On a good day, your breasts can feel tender. They're always out on the front lines, taking the brunt of every afternoon jog and pouncing toddler. The catchall name for an infection of the breast tissue is mastitis. Mastitis can make you feel like you have the flu, but it can be cured a lot quicker. This happens when your baby isn't sucking or attaching properly, or favors one breast over the other. Mastitis can also happen if you don't feed or pump regularly. Breastfeeding women aren't the only ones who get mastitis. If you're not breastfeeding, a cracked nipple or nipple piercing can cause the breast infection. Just like any other infection, the tissue around the infected area becomes inflamed to keep it from spreading to other parts of the body. With mastitis, the infected milk duct causes the breast to swell. Your breast may look red and feel tender or warm. Many women with mastitis feel like they have the flu, including achiness, chills, and a fever of 101 F or higher. When you feel that pain or see the telltale redness, call your doctor as soon as possible. The fever and chills give it away, as does a red, wedge-shaped area on the breast that points toward the nipple. There are two things to rule out: a breast abscess, which happens when mastitis isn't treated quickly, and inflammatory breast cancer, which is rare and shares the symptoms of redness and swelling. If you are breastfeeding, taking care of yourself -- which can be tough to do when you have a baby -- will help you feel better fast. Your doctor may suggest ibuprofen, or something like it, to take care of the fever and pain. It's important to keep breastfeeding and move that milk in and out of the ducts. To keep milk from backing up, make sure your baby attaches correctly, and get all the milk out of each breast during every feeding."], [101, "Jaundice", "If your new baby's skin and eyes look yellow, it's possible he may have jaundice. It may seem alarming to you, but it's a common problem in newborns, and it's usually harmless. Some of the body's red blood cells break down every day and create bilirubin in the blood. When your baby is still in your womb, your liver clears out his bilirubin for him. Because bilirubin is a yellow compound, it turns your baby's skin and eyes yellow. Your newborn might be getting jaundice because he: Has a liver that's still maturing Was born prematurely Isn't getting enough breast milk, or something in the breast milk is causing jaundice Jaundice typically shows up 2 or 3 days after your baby is born. These kinds are caused by a disease or condition, such as: Hemorrhage (bleeding) somewhere inside your baby's body Infection of the blood (sepsis) Bacterial or viral infections Liver problems Lack of certain enzymes Problem with red blood cells that makes them break too easily Jaundice may also happen if a mom has a different blood type from her baby. If that's your situation, your body may make antibodies that attack your baby's red blood cells. Your baby may have a greater chance of getting jaundice if he's: Born before 37 weeks Of East Asian or Mediterranean descent Has trouble breast or bottle feeding A younger sibling of a child who had jaundice Born to a mother with O-type or Rh negative blood The telltale sign of jaundice is a yellow color to your baby's skin and yellow in the whites of his eyes. Once bilirubin levels in the blood get higher, the yellow color moves to the chest and stomach, and then, finally, the legs and arms. Usually, a doctor can tell your baby has jaundice by looking at him. But she will also want to know how much bilirubin is in your baby's blood to help decide on a treatment plan. She may: Draw blood from your baby and send it to a lab. Test your baby's skin with an instrument that measures bilirubin levels by shining a special light on him. If your doctor suspects that a condition is causing your baby's jaundice, she may do other tests, like a urine sample. Your doctor will decide whether your baby should wait it out or start treatments like: Extra feedings. Taking in more breast milk or formula will help your baby poop more often, which can help clear out bilirubin from the body. Or, if your baby is having trouble breastfeeding, your doctor may recommend you feed him breast milk from a bottle or also feed him formula. If your baby's jaundice happens because he has a different type from his mom, your doctor may need to give him a blood protein through an IV that helps stop the breakdown of red blood cells. If your baby has severe jaundice that isn't getting better with other methods, he may need a blood transfusion called an exchange transfusion. In this process, your doctor draws small amounts of your baby's blood and replaces it with blood from a donor. Your baby will need to stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for the procedure. There isn't much you can do to prevent the typical jaundice in newborns. If you're breastfeeding, aim for 8-12 feedings a day in the first days of your baby's life."], [102, "Jarcho Levin Syndrome", "Jarcho-Levin syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by distinctive malformations of bones of the spinal column (vertebrae) and the ribs, respiratory insufficiency, and/or other abnormalities.

If that's the case, it could be time to consider knee replacement surgery. Also known as arthroplasty, knee replacement surgery is one of the most common bone surgeries in the United States. U.S. doctors perform more than 600,000 knee replacement surgeries each year. During surgery, an orthopedic surgeon carves away the damaged part of the knee and replaces it with an artificial joint made of metal or plastic. The artificial joint is then attached to the thigh bone, shin, and kneecap with a special material such as acrylic cement. Deformities: People with bowed legs or \"knock-knees\" often get surgery to restore the position of the knee. Loss of blood flow: Doctors will recommend surgery if blood stops flowing to the bones (a condition called either osteonecrosis or avascular necrosis). There are four main types of knee replacement surgery: Total knee replacement. Your surgeon replaces the surfaces of the thigh bone and shin bone that connects to the knee. If arthritis affects only one side of your knee, this surgery may be a possibility. Partial knee replacement can be performed through a smaller cut than is needed for total knee replacement. This replaces only the under-surface of the kneecap, but some surgeons advise against this procedure, because total knee replacement surgery has a higher rate of success. Knee replacement surgery, which can take 1 to 2 hours, has become so precise that doctors can choose from a variety of knee designs that suit your height, weight, and activity level. The implants, as they are called, are made from a variety of materials, including metal, ceramic, or plastic. A common artificial knee design replaces the PCL (posterior cruciate ligament), located in the back of the knee. Some artificial knees are designed for partial knee replacement, while others are built to keep the PCL and ACL right where they are. Doctors first started replacing knees in the early 1970s. Back then, surgeons said the new knees would last about a decade or so. By 2030, it's estimated doctors will perform about 450,000 total knee replacement operations a year."], [107, "Kluver Bucy Syndrome", "Kluver-Bucy syndrome is a very rare cerebral neurological disorder associated with damage to both temporal lobes resulting in abnormalities in memory, social and sexual functioning and idiosyncratic behaviors."], [108, "Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome", "Summary Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a rare disorder that is present at birth (congenital) and is characterized by a triad of cutaneous capillary malformation (\"port-wine stain\"), lymphatic anomalies, and abnormal veins in association with variable overgrowth of soft tissue and bone.

If you are already in the hospital, tests done for other problems may find your kidney problem. If you're not in the hospital but have symptoms of kidney injury, your doctor will ask about your symptoms, what medicines you take, and what tests you have had. Your symptoms can help point to the cause of your kidney problem. Blood and urine tests can check how well your kidneys are working. A chemistry screen can show if you have normal levels of sodium (salt), potassium, and calcium. This imaging test lets your doctor see a picture of your kidneys. Your doctor or a kidney specialist (nephrologist) will try to treat the problem that is causing your kidney injury.

Most of the time our body movements do not cause problems, but it's not surprising that symptoms develop from everyday wear and tear, overuse, or injury. Knee problems and injuries most often occur during sports or recreational activities, work-related tasks, or home projects. The upper and lower bones of the knee are separated by two discs (menisci). The upper leg bone (femur) and the lower leg bones (tibia and fibula) are connected by ligaments, tendons, and muscles. The surface of the bones inside the knee joint is covered by articular cartilage, which absorbs shock and provides a smooth, gliding surface for joint movement. Although a knee problem is often caused by an injury to one or more of these structures, it may have another cause. Many jobs, sports and recreation activities, getting older, or having a disease such as osteoporosis or arthritis increase your chances of having problems with your knees. Sudden (acute) injuries may be caused by a direct blow to the knee or from abnormal twisting, bending the knee, or falling on the knee. Pain, bruising, or swelling may be severe and develop within minutes of the injury. The knee or lower leg may feel numb, weak, or cold; tingle; or look pale or blue. The medial collateral ligament (MCL) is the most commonly injured ligament of the knee. Breaks (fracture) of the kneecap, lower portion of the femur, or upper part of the tibia or fibula. Knee fractures are most commonly caused by abnormal force, such as a falling on the knee, a severe twisting motion, severe force that bends the knee, or when the knee forcefully hits an object. Pieces of bone or tissue (loose bodies) from a fracture or dislocation that may get caught in the joint and interfere with movement. Overuse injuries occur with repetitive activities or repeated or prolonged pressure on the knee. Problems not directly related to an injury or overuse may occur in or around the knee. Other types of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and lupus, also can cause knee pain, swelling, and stiffness. Osgood-Schlatter disease causes pain, swelling, and tenderness in the front of the knee below the kneecap. A popliteal (or Baker's) cyst causes swelling in the back of the knee. Infection in the skin (cellulitis), joint (infectious arthritis), bone (osteomyelitis), or bursa (septic bursitis) can cause pain and decreased knee movement. A problem elsewhere in the body, such as a pinched nerve or a problem in the hip, can sometimes cause knee pain. Osteochondritis dissecans causes pain and decreased movement when a piece of bone or cartilage or both inside the knee joint loses blood supply and dies.

Sometimes, however, the structure of the cornea is just not strong enough to hold this round shape and the cornea bulges outward like a cone. Tiny fibers of protein in the eye called collagen help hold the cornea in place and keep it from bulging. When these fibers become weak, they cannot hold the shape and the cornea becomes progressively more cone shaped. Normally, antioxidants get rid of them and protect the collagen fibers. If you have it and have children, it's a good idea to have their eyes checked for it starting at age 10. The condition progresses more rapidly in people with certain medical problems, including certain allergic conditions. The changes in the shape of the cornea can happen quickly or may occur over several years. The changes can result in blurred vision, glare and halos at night, and the streaking of lights. In most people who have keratoconus, both eyes are eventually affected, although not always to the same extent. It usually develops in one eye first and then later in the other eye. With severe keratoconus, the stretched collagen fibers can lead to severe scarring. If the back of the cornea tears, it can swell and take many months for the swelling to go away. The changes to the cornea can make it impossible for the eye to focus without eyeglasses or contact lenses. In fact, a corneal transplant may be needed to restore vision if the condition is severe. Laser vision correction surgery -- LASIK - is dangerous for people with keratoconus because it can further weaken the cornea and make vision worse. Keratoconus changes vision in two ways: As the cornea changes from a ball shape to a cone shape, the smooth surface becomes wavy. As the front of the cornea expands, vision becomes more nearsighted. These include: A sudden change of vision in one eye Double vision when looking with just one eye Objects both near and far looking distorted Bright lights looking like they have halos around them Lights streaking Seeing double or triple ghost images Being uncomfortable driving due to blurry vision, especially at night To be sure you have keratoconus, your doctor needs to measure the shape of the cornea. The most common way is called 'cornea topography,' which snaps a photo of the cornea and analyzes it in seconds. Children of parents with keratoconus should have a cornea topography done every year starting at age 10 to monitor the cornea. Even if your child's cornea topography is normal, it's still important to have this test performed yearly. With annual tests, your doctor can compare results to identify those changes if they're present. Eventually, though, it will probably be necessary to use contact lenses or seek other treatments to strengthen the cornea and improve vision. Intacs are implants that are placed under the surface of the cornea to reduce the cone shape and improve vision. If eyeglasses and contact lenses no longer provide stable and comfortable good quality vision, a cornea transplant can be performed. This involves removing the center of the cornea and replacing it with a donor cornea that is stitched into place."], [148, "Keratitis Ichthyosis Deafness Syndrome", "Keratitis ichthyosis deafness (KID) syndrome is a rare, genetic, multi-system disorder.

A closely related disorder, normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH), refers to patients with pubertal failure but with a normal sense of smell. Both KS and nIHH are due to an isolated deficiency of a key reproductive hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). While these reproductive symptoms predominate in their presentation, non-reproductive features that may be present in KS/nIHH subjects include: facial abnormalities (eg. As this is a genetic condition, testing for the various different genetic forms of this disease may also assist in making the diagnosis. For therapy, initially, hormone replacement therapy (testosterone in males; estrogen and progesterone in females) is used to induce secondary sexual characteristics. Once pubertal maturation is achieved, if KS and nIHH subjects wish to be fertile, either injections of pituitary hormones (the gonadotropins, LH and FSH) or in some instances, therapy with the synthetic peptide, GnRH, whose deficiency causes these syndromes, are required to induce the sex organs (testes or ovaries) to make sperm (males) or eggs (females). While both KS and nIHH are usually life-long in their nature, about 10-15% of patients may experience a recovery of their hormonal system, the reasons for which currently remain unclear. Reproductive function in humans is under the control of a group of ~ 1,200-1,500 cells (neurons) called GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone) neurons. At the time of puberty, these neurons coordinately secrete GnRH, a peptide hormone, in a series of discrete series of bursts or pulses. This pulsatile pattern of secretion of GnRH is the key to stimulating the production of two other glycoprotein hormones from the pituitary which is downstream from the hypothalamus, namely luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). In turn, LH and FSH act on the sex organs or gonads in both sexes (testicles in men; ovaries in women) to do two things that are essential for human reproduction. Pathophysiology of Kallmann syndrome (KS) and normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH) GnRH is the master controller or 'pilot light' of reproduction. the early developing nose); then migrate along the fetal olfactory (smell-related) neurons that also originate in the nose; and eventually enter the brain ultimately wending their way to the hypothalamus, their ultimate residence during early gestation. In both sexes, these GnRH neurons are fully active and functional secreting GnRH soon after birth (neonatal period) and begin to secrete GnRH in a characteristic pulse pattern. Defects in either the development of GnRH neurons or their secretory function result in disruption of normal puberty. The condition of KS results when there is failure of the early development and/or migration of the GnRH neurons in the fetus. Therefore, when this migratory journey is interrupted due to various genetic defects, patients develop this unique combination of GnRH deficiency and anosmia (due to loss of olfactory neurons), that define this clinical syndrome. In both KS and nIHH patients, the rest of the hypothalamic and pituitary hormones are completely normal and the radiographic appearance of the hypothalamic-pituitary region is typically normal. Taken together, both KS and nIHH represent patients with \"isolated GnRH deficiency\" (IGD), which is the most precise pathophysiologic definition of this disorder. However, even in Kallmann's first report, the presence of nIHH individuals was also recognized in some of these families as well as the presence of various non-reproductive clinical features.

Abnormal cartilage and bone development may also affect other bones of the body, particularly those of the hands and feet (i.e., metacarpals and metatarsals). In addition, affected adults may eventually develop abnormally hardened (sclerotic) bones especially in the back of the head (cranial bones), which, in some cases, may lead to blindness and/or deafness. Most cases of Jansen type metaphyseal chondrodysplasia occur randomly as the result of a spontaneous genetic change (i.e., new genetic mutation)."], [154, "Muscular Dystrophies", "It is caused by a problem in the genes that control how the body keeps muscles healthy. How muscular dystrophy affects you or your child depends on the kind. Most people's condition will get worse over time, and some people may lose the ability to walk, talk, or care for themselves. There are more than 30 kinds of muscular dystrophy, and each is different based on: The genes that cause it The muscles it affects The age when symptoms first appear How quickly the disease gets worse People usually get one of nine major forms of the disease: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common form. Becker muscular dystrophy is like Duchenne, except milder. Myotonic muscular dystrophy is the most common form in adults. Limb-Girdle muscular dystrophy often starts in a person's teens or 20s. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy affects the muscles of the face, shoulders, and upper arms. Distal muscular dystrophy affects the muscles of the arms, legs, hands, and feet. Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy starts in a person's 40s or 50s. It causes weakness in the muscles of the face, neck, and shoulders, and droopy eyelids (ptosis), followed by difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). People with this form often have heart problems along with muscle weakness. There are many treatments that can help keep muscles strong and flexible, and scientists are looking for new ones, too.The important thing is to get the treatment you need and find support. Muscular dystrophy can run in families, or you can be the first one in your family to have it. Genes contain the information your cells need to make proteins that control all of the different functions in the body. When a gene has a problem, your cells can make the wrong protein, the wrong amount of it, or a damaged protein. You can get muscular dystrophy even if neither of your parents had the disease. In people with muscular dystrophy, the broken genes are the ones that make the proteins that keep muscles healthy and strong. For example, those with Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophies make too little of a protein called dystrophin, which strengthens muscles and protects them from injury. For most types of muscular dystrophy, symptoms start to show up in childhood or in the teen years. In general, children with the condition: Fall down often Have weak muscles Have muscle cramps Have trouble getting up, climbing stairs, running, or jumping Walk on their toes or waddle Some will also have symptoms like: A curved spine (called scoliosis) Droopy eyelids Heart problems Trouble breathing or swallowing Vision problems Weakness in the muscles of the face Your doctor will need to check different parts of your child's body to know if he has muscular dystrophy. He'll also ask you questions about your family's medical history and the kind of symptoms you're noticing in your child. He also may ask you questions about how your child plays, moves, and speaks, as well as how he acts at home and at school. The doctor may use different tests to check for conditions that can cause muscle weakness. Your doctor will put small needles, called electrodes, on different parts of your child's body and ask him to slowly flex and relax his muscles. Using a needle, your doctor removes a small piece of your child's muscle tissue. This test can show the type of muscular dystrophy your child may have. It measures electrical signals from the heart and tells how fast your child's heart is beating and if it has a healthy rhythm. Imaging can show the quality and amount of muscle in your child's body. He may get: MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging. It uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of his organs.Ultrasound, which uses sound waves to make pictures of the inside of the body. Ultrasound, which uses sound waves to make pictures of the inside of the body. Doctors can also test a sample of his blood to look for the genes that cause muscular dystrophy. Genetic tests can help diagnose the condition, but they're also important for people with a family history of the disease who are planning to start a family. You can talk with your doctor or a genetics counselor to find out what the results of this test mean for you and your children. You'll want to find out as much about your child's condition as you can to learn how he can stay as healthy as possible. You may want to ask: What kind of muscular dystrophy does he have? Your doctor will recommend a treatment based on the type of muscular dystrophy your child has. Some of them are: Physical therapy uses different exercises and stretches to keep muscles strong and flexible. Occupational therapy teaches your child how to make the most of what his muscles can do. Speech therapy will teach him easier ways to talk if his throat or face muscles are weak. Respiratory therapy can help if your child is having trouble breathing. He'll learn ways to make it easier to breathe, or get machines to help. Eteplirsen (Exondys 51) has been approved to treat DMD. Although the drug increases dystrophin production, which would predict improvement in muscle function, this has not yet been shown. Anti-seizure drugs reduce muscle spasms.Blood pressure medicines help with heart problems.Drugs that turn down the body's immune system, called immunosuppressants, may slow damage to muscle cells.Steroids like prednisone slow down muscle damage and can help your child breathe better. They can cause serious side effects, such as weak bones and a higher risk of infections.Creatine, a chemical normally found in the body, can help supply energy to muscles and improve strength for some people.

Scientists also are looking for new ways to treat muscular dystrophy in clinical trials. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for your child. Muscular dystrophy is a challenge, but it doesn't have to keep your child from enjoying life. It's also important for helping him stay at a healthy weight, which can ease breathing problems and other symptoms. If it's hard for him to chew or swallow, talk to a dietitian about foods that may be easier to eat. Exercise can improve your child's muscle strength and make him feel better. Wheelchairs, crutches, or electric scooters can help your child if he has trouble walking. Remember that it's OK to ask a doctor, counselor, family, or friends for help with any stress, sadness, or anger you may feel. Support groups are also good places to talk to other people who have lived with muscular dystrophy. Some children may lose muscle strength very slowly, giving them and their families time to adjust to the changes. Many people with the disease will need wheelchairs and help with daily living at some point, but that's not always the case. Together, you can make the best possible treatment plan for him and get the support you need for your family.

The person with MSP gains attention by seeking medical help for exaggerated or made-up symptoms of a child in his or her care. As health care providers strive to identify what's causing the child's symptoms, the deliberate actions of the mother or caretaker can often make the symptoms worse. The person with MSP does not seem to be motivated by a desire for any type of material gain. While health care providers are often unable to identify the specific cause of the child's illness, they may not suspect the mother or caretaker of doing anything to harm the child. In fact the caregiver often appears to be very loving and caring and extremely distraught over her child's illness. People with MSP may create or exaggerate a child's symptoms in several ways. They may simply lie about symptoms, alter tests (such as contaminating a urine sample), falsify medical records, or they may actually induce symptoms through various means, such as poisoning, suffocating, starving, and causing infection. Certain characteristics are common in a person with MSP, including: Is a parent or caregiver, usually a mother May be a health care professional Is very friendly and cooperative with the health care providers Appears quite concerned (some may seem overly concerned) about their child May suffer from Munchausen syndrome (a related disorder in which a person repeatedly acts as if he or she has a physical or mental illness when he or she is not really sick) Other possible warning signs of MSP include: The child has a history of many hospitalizations, often with a strange set of symptoms. Worsening of the child's symptoms generally is reported by the mother and is not witnessed by the hospital staff. There may be signs of chemicals in the child's blood, stool, or urine. The exact cause of MSP is not known, but researchers are looking at the roles of biological and psychological factors in its development. Some theories suggest that a history of abuse or neglect as a child, or the early loss of a parent may be factors in its development. There are no reliable statistics regarding the number of people in the U.S. who suffer from MSP, and it is difficult to assess how common the disorder is because many cases go undetected. Doctors must rule out any possible physical illness as the cause of the child's symptoms before a diagnosis of MSP can be made. If a physical cause of the symptoms is not found, a thorough review of the child's medical history, as well as a review of the family history and the mother's medical history (many have Munchausen syndrome themselves) may provide clues to suggest MSP. The goal of therapy for MSP is to help the person identify the thoughts and feelings that are contributing to the behavior, and to learn to form relationships that are not associated with being ill. In some situations, a child victim of MSP learns to relate getting attention to being sick and develops Munchausen syndrome themselves. In general, MSP is a very difficult disorder to treat and often requires years of therapy and support."], [156, "Mumps", "Mumps is a contagious viral infection that can cause painful swelling of the salivary glands, especially the parotid glands (between the ear and the jaw). This vaccine is part of the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) and MMRV (measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella [chickenpox]) vaccines. Before the mumps vaccine existed, mumps was a common childhood disease in the United States and Canada. Mumps is spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes near you or shares food or drinks. You can spread the virus 7 days before and for 9 days after symptoms start. You are most likely to spread the virus 1 to 2 days before and 5 days after symptoms start. Headache, earache, sore throat, and pain when you swallow or open your mouth. It usually takes 2 to 3 weeks to get symptoms after you have been exposed to the virus. Some people who are infected with the mumps virus don't have any symptoms. Mumps is usually diagnosed based on symptoms and a history of exposure to the virus. If needed, a blood test can be done to confirm that you have mumps and rule out other illnesses. The mumps virus can be identified with a viral culture using a sample of urine, saliva, or cerebrospinal fluid. If you think that you or your child has mumps, be sure to call ahead and explain the symptoms before you go to a doctor's office. It's important to stay away from other people as much as you can so that you don't spread the disease. In most cases, people recover from mumps with rest and care at home. If you or your child has mumps: Take medicine to help relieve fever or headache, if needed. If you give medicine to a baby, follow your doctor's advice about what amount to give. Do not give aspirin to anyone younger than 20 because of the risk of Reye syndrome. Drink extra fluids to help reduce fever and prevent dehydration. Eat soft foods that don't require chewing. Anyone who has mumps should stay out of school, day care, work, and public places until 5 days after the salivary glands first start to swell.1 In general, you don't need to separate the sick person from the rest of the family. By the time mumps is diagnosed, most household members have already been exposed.

In multiple myeloma, a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell multiplies unusually. But in multiple myeloma, they release too much protein (called immunoglobulin) into your bones and blood. The plasma cells also crowd normal blood cells in your bones. As multiple myeloma gets worse, those plasma cells begin to spill out of your bone marrow and spread through your body.

As time passes, you could notice: Bone pain Weakness and fatigue Weight loss In rare cases, plasma cells can form purplish lumps that you can see underneath your skin. Your doctor may test you for multiple myeloma if a blood test shows you have: Too much calcium in your blood (your doctor will call it hypercalcemia) Anemia (too few red blood cells) Kidney problems High protein levels in your blood combined with a low albumin level (your doctor might say you have a \"globulin gap\") If your doctor thinks you have multiple myeloma, he'll test your blood, urine, and bones. Some tests he may order include: Electrophoresis, which measures immunoglobulin Blood urea nitrogen, also known as BUN, and creatinine. After your test results come in, your doctor might want to do a bone marrow biopsy. He'll insert a needle into a bone, usually in your hip, to get a sample of bone marrow to check the number of plasma cells in it. They can show spots of bone weakened by multiple myeloma. Chemotherapy: You might get it alone or paired with another drug. The types of chemo most often used to treat multiple myeloma are: Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) Melphalan (Alkeran) Liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) Panobinostat (Farydak) Corticosteroids: If you're getting chemo, the doctor might prescribe dexamethasone or prednisone to reduce side effects. Stem cell transplant: It won't work for everyone, but if your doctor thinks you're a good fit for it, they may start with a stem cell transplant. They will use a machine to remove some of your stem cells, then freeze and store them. This will destroy almost all the cells in your bone marrow -- both healthy cells and the plasma cells that cause the disease. Then the doctor will injects the stem cells into your veins. They travel to the bone marrow, where they multiply and make new, healthy blood cells. Stem cell transplantation doesn't cure multiple myeloma, but it often helps you live longer. They also help starve the myeloma cells in your bone marrow by preventing new blood vessels from forming: Lenalidomide (Revlimid) Pomalidomide (Pomalyst) Thalidomide (Thalomid) Monoclonal antibodies help your immune system spot and destroy myeloma cells. You might hear your doctor call this immunotherapy: Daratumumab (Darzalex) Elotuzumab (Empliciti) If you don't have symptoms, your doctor will probably start you on one of these drugs to prevent myeloma from getting to a point where you need treatment. When they build up, the cells die: Bortezomib (Velcade) Carfilzomib (Kyprolis) Ixazomib (Ninlaro) Your Treatment Plan If you don't have symptoms, your doctor may choose to watch you closely rather than start treatment right away. Your plan will have three main phases: Induction therapy: Use medications to get quick control of the disease and its symptoms Post-induction therapy: Add treatments like chemotherapy or a stem cell transplant (your doctor might also call it consolidation therapy) Maintenance therapy: Keep your cancer at bay as long as possible Which drugs your doctor chooses depends on your age and how aggressive your cancer is. Most people start with a three-drug mix that combines a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory drug, and a corticosteroid. If you're considered high risk, you might want to look into a clinical trial for an existing or new treatment. But if yours causes painful bone damage, your doctor might suggest: Bisphosphonates: These drugs treat bone damage. The doctor may have you try: Pamidronate (Aredia) Zoledronic acid (Zometa) Be especially thorough with your brushing and flossing while you take these medications. Radiation therapy: The doctor will direct a beam from a machine to a bone or other affected body part. The beam kills plasma cells, which can ease your pain and strengthen weakened bones. A dietitian can help you choose the right foods, especially if you're having trouble with certain foods because of your treatment. Stay active to improve your mood and energy level, and protect your bones. Ask for help when you need it, and seek out support groups to help you and your family manage this disease. Identifying the forms of multiple myeloma is often challenging for doctors. The simplest and most common uses the blood levels of two substances: albumin and beta-2-microglobulin. A higher albumin level and a lower beta-2-microglobulin level suggest a better chance for longer survival. Other systems use multiple lab or DNA tests in plasma cells.

MMN is not life-threatening, and, in most cases, treatments can make the muscles stronger. The disease can get worse slowly, and after a while, you may have a hard time doing daily tasks, like typing or getting dressed. Most people are diagnosed with MMN in their 40s and 50s, although adults from ages 20 to 80 can find out they have the disease. Researchers are studying the disease to try to find out why it happens. If you have MMN, you'll most likely notice the first symptoms in your hands and lower arms. It may start in specific parts of the arm or hand, like the wrist or finger. Usually the symptoms are more severe on one side of your body. Doctors often mistake MMN for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

You'll get the drug directly into one of your veins through an IV. You'll usually get it in a doctor's office, although you can learn to do it at home. If IVIg works, you should feel your muscle strength improve within 3 to 6 weeks. The effects will wear off over time, though, so you'll need to keep having the treatment. People usually have it once a month, but it may be more or less often depending on your condition. IVIg doesn't have many side effects, but it is expensive. Doctors are testing ways to give it directly through the skin like a regular shot, but this method isn't available for everyone. If IVIg doesn't work, your doctor may try a drug called cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), which is also used to treat certain types of cancer. If you get treatment for MMN early, you're more likely to have few symptoms or long-term problems. Stick to your treatment plan, and talk to your doctor about any changes in how you're feeling.

MRSA infections are common among people who have weak immune systems and are in hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care centers. According to the CDC, invasive MRSA infections that began in hospitals declined 8% between 2011 and 2013. Community-Associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) Alarmingly, MRSA is also showing up in healthy people who have not been hospitalized. This type of MRSA is called community-associated MRSA, or CA-MRSA. But more and more CA-MRSA infections are being seen in the general community, especially in certain geographic regions. In a study of Minnesotans published in TheJournal of the American Medical Association, the average age of people with MRSA in a hospital or health care facility was 68. But the average age of a person with CA-MRSA was only 23."], [178, "MRS", "Melkersson Rosenthal syndrome is a rare neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, long lasting swelling of the face, particularly one or both lips (granulomatous cheilitis), facial muscle weakness (palsy) and a fissured tongue."], [179, "MPS Disorder VI", "Summary Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type VI; MPS VI) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by complete or partial lack of activity of the enzyme arylsulfatase B (also called N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase). Deficiency or absence of this enzyme activity leads to the accumulation of complex carbohydrates called glycosaminoglycans (previously known as mucopolysaccharides) in the body. The symptoms and severity of Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome can vary dramatically from one person to another; some individuals only develop mild symptoms, while others develop severe, even life-threatening complications. In 2005, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the enzyme replacement therapy known as Naglazyme(r) for the treatment of Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome. Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome occurs due to mutations in the ARSB gene and is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder. Introduction The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of inherited lysosomal storage disorders. Enzymes within lysosomes break down or digest particular metabolites, such as certain carbohydrates and fats. In individuals with MPS disorders, deficiency or malfunction of specific lysosomal enzymes leads to an abnormal accumulation of certain complex carbohydrates known as mucopolysaccharides or glycosaminoglycans in the arteries, skeleton, eyes, joints, ears, skin, and/or teeth. These disorders, with one exception (MPS type II), are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome was named from the two French physicians who first described this disorder in the medical literature in 1963."], [180, "MPS Disorder II", "Hunter syndrome, also called mucopolysaccharidosis II or MPS II, is a rare disease that's passed on in families. Their bodies can't break down a kind of sugar that builds bones, skin, tendons, and other tissue. Those sugars build up in their cells and damage many parts of the body, including the brain. When your son has Hunter syndrome, there are things you can do to help him play, have friends, and do some of the things that other kids do, even though he may look different from his pals. Although there is no cure for Hunter syndrome, there are ways to help manage it and live with the symptoms. Boys with the disease can't make a certain protein because there's a problem with a small piece of their DNA, called a gene, that comes from their mother. A dad with Hunter syndrome will pass the problem gene to his daughter, but she won't get the disease unless she gets the gene from her mom, too. It's possible -- but very, very unlikely -- that someone could develop Hunter syndrome even though no one in their family going back has had it. When Hunter syndrome affects the brain, which is about 75% of the time, symptoms usually show up between 18 months and 4 years of age. They start about 2 years later when the disease is milder. Hunter syndrome usually affects how the boy looks: Large, round cheeks Broad nose Thick lips and a large tongue Bushy eyebrows Large head Slowed growth Thick, tough skin Short, broad hands with stiff, curled fingers He'll probably have these symptoms: Joint problems that make it hard to move Numbness, weakness, and tingling in his hands A lot of coughs, colds, and sinus and throat infections Breathing problems, including pauses in breathing at night, or sleep apnea Hearing loss and ear infections Trouble walking and weak muscles Bowel problems, such as diarrhea Heart problems, including damaged heart valves Enlarged liver and spleen Bone thickening When a boy's brain is affected, it's likely he'll have: Trouble thinking and learning by the time he is 2 to 4 years old Trouble talking Behavior problems such as a hard time sitting still or aggression Kids who have Hunter syndrome are usually cheerful and affectionate, despite the problems it can cause. If the doctors can't find another explanation for your son's symptoms, they'll test for Hunter syndrome by checking for: High levels of that certain sugar in his urine How active the \"missing\" protein is in his blood or skin cells The abnormal gene After doctors are sure it's Hunter syndrome, it's a good idea to let extended family members know about the gene problem, too. If you're a pregnant woman and you know you carry the gene or you already have a child with Hunter syndrome, you can find out whether the baby you're carrying is affected. If I have more children, are they likely to have this disease? Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) can help slow the disease for boys with milder Hunter syndrome. ERT can help improve: Walking, climbing stairs, and the ability to keep up in general Movement and stiff joints Breathing Growth Hair and facial features ERT is the first treatment for kids whose brains aren't affected. It doesn't slow the disease in the brain. These transplants bring cells into your child's body that can hopefully make the protein he's missing. The new cells come from either a bone marrow donor whose cells match your child's or the stem cells of umbilical cord blood from newborn babies. They also haven't been shown to help when the brain is affected. Research is under way to find effective treatments for boys with severe Hunter syndrome. Because so many different parts of your child's body can be affected, you'll probably need to see several doctors to help you manage the condition, including: Cardiologist: a heart specialist Ear, nose, and throat specialist Eye doctor Lung specialist Mental health professional Neurologist: works with the brain and nerves Speech therapist Medication or surgery can ease some of the complications. Physical therapy can help with joint and movement issues. And occupational therapy can help you make changes at home and school to make it easier to get around and do things. Focus on keeping your son healthy and giving him the chance to live a meaningful, rewarding life. Talk about him as a person -- his interests, his curiosity, and his sunny personality, too. Let them know what his needs as well as his abilities are, and how they can help, if that's appropriate. Start stretching and range-of-motion exercises early to keep his joints flexible. Choose large toys that are easy to grab and hold on to, that won't be damaged by chewing. Talk to other kids (or their parents) about how to interact with your son. Walk up to him from the front, with hands out. But kids will be kids, so prepare him for stares and teasing with role-play and humor. Help him learn as much as he can while his brain is working well. If he goes to school, work with the staff to come up with an individualized education program (IEP) for him. He may be eligible for one-on-one attention in the classroom or help for other issues, like hearing problems. You'll do a better job caring for your child when you have people you can turn to to help out with caregiving tasks. Step back, and take a break to rest and recharge. Remember, the whole family is affected by this disease. Some boys with less severe Hunter syndrome grow up and live long lives. But heart disease and trouble breathing can still cause problems for them. Kids with severe Hunter syndrome are less likely to reach adulthood. Their brains will slowly stop working, and eventually they'll need special care to make them comfortable. Parents of other Hunter syndrome boys are a great resource for understanding what's going on, sharing your feelings, and getting ideas for how to live with the condition. You can find ways to enjoy the time that you have with your child. They can also help you connect with other families who are facing the same challenges."], [181, "MPS Disorder I", "People with MPS I can't make a specific protein called alpha-L iduronidase, which is needed to break down sugars. These sugars build up in cells and cause damage throughout the body. People who have this disease can have problems with how their bodies grow and work, as well as trouble with thinking and learning. Many people with milder MPS I can go to school and eventually work and have families. And even for people with more severe MPS I, there are treatments to help ease their symptoms and slow down the disease. Because it affects people in so many different ways, doctors used to separate MPS I into groups: Hurler, Hurler-Scheie, and Scheie syndromes. Now they talk about a range between two forms: Severe Attenuated, or less severe MPS I is passed down through families. If you get one normal gene and one \"bad\" gene, you won't have symptoms of MPS I. Many babies with MPS I don't show any signs of the disease at first. For those with less severe MPS I, symptoms show up later in childhood. People with this form, attenuated MPS I, probably can make a tiny bit of the protein, which is why their symptoms are milder and the disease moves very slowly. Children who have the severe form usually start to have symptoms while they're still infants. They're often big when they're born and grow quickly for a year, but then stop by the time they're 3. They might never grow taller than 4 feet. They also tend to look similar: Shorter than average, with stocky build Large head, bulging forehead Thick lips, widely spaced teeth, and large tongue Short, flat nose with wide nostrils Thick, tough skin Short, broad hands with curving fingers Knock-knees and walking on toes Curved spine MPS I can show up in a lot of different ways: Eye problems, including cloudy eyes and a hard time seeing in bright light or at night Bad breath, dental problems Weak neck Breathing problems and airway infections, including runny nose, sinus infections, and sleep apnea Ear infections and hearing loss Numbness and tingling in fingers or feet Heart disease Stiff joints and trouble moving Hernias, which look like a bulge around the belly button or in the groin Diarrhea Enlarged liver or spleen Your child might not have all of those symptoms. People with the milder form of the disease usually don't have as many physical problems. They typically have a normal intelligence and can do many things other people do. The more severe the disease, the more of these problems your child is likely to have. Severe MPS I can also affect intelligence and learning. If the doctors can't find another explanation for your child's symptoms, they'll test for MPS I by checking for: A lot of a specific sugar in their urine How active the \"missing\" protein is in their blood or skin cells After doctors are sure it's MPS I, it's a good idea to let your extended family know about the gene problem, too. If you're a woman who gets pregnant and you know you carry the gene, or you already have a child with MPS I, you can find out whether the baby you're carrying is affected. If I have more children, how likely are they to have MPS I? It can relieve most symptoms and slow the progress of the disease, although it doesn't help treat symptoms from the brain, like problems with thinking or learning. Another option may be a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), in which doctors put new cells into your child's body that might make the protein their body is missing. When children get a transplant before they're 2 years old, they might be able to learn better. Work with a doctor who specializes in lysosomal storage diseases, or LSDs. Depending on what symptoms your child has, you might need to see other specialists, too. Often they'll include a cardiologist, who focuses on the heart, and an eye doctor. They might not know what to say, possibly because they don't want to pry or offend or embarrass you. When people ask about your child, tell them about his condition and what he can and can't do. Also mention your child's interests, his curiosity, and his personality. Talk to the staff at your child's school to come up with an individualized education program (IEP). Your child might need one-on-one attention in the classroom, a special desk, or other adjustments. To protect their necks, kids with MPS I should avoid contact sports, gymnastics, trampolines, and similar activities. Look for ways to change how your home is set up to make it easier for your child to move around and do things on his own. Although there is no cure for MPS I, treatments can improve the quality of life -- especially when started early. Most kids who have less severe MPS I can go to school with other children. Adults are protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act, so they might be able to work and live on their own. Children with the most severe form usually get worse very quickly, and they might not live to be teenagers. Special care focuses on easing pain and offering support, so your child and your family can have the best quality of life.

Inadequate blood supply then leads to reduced oxygen delivery to the brain, and it is this oxygen deprivation that causes the signs of moyamoya.

Children from 5 to 12 years old, women, and older adults get motion sickness more than others do. Motion sickness is sometimes called airsickness, seasickness, or carsickness. Motion sickness can cause: A general feeling that you're ill. Nausea. You get motion sickness when one part of your balance-sensing system (your inner ear , eyes, and sensory nerves) senses that your body is moving, but the other parts don't. For example, if you are in the cabin of a moving ship, your inner ear may sense the motion of waves, but your eyes don't see any movement. This conflict between the senses causes motion sickness. You may feel sick from the motion of cars, airplanes, trains, amusement park rides, or boats or ships. You could also get sick from video games, flight simulators, or looking through a microscope. In these cases, your eyes see motion, but your body doesn't sense it. These include: Scopolamine, which comes as a patch you put behind your ear. Examples are ondansetron (Zofran) and prochlorperazine (Compazine). Certain antihistamines, such as dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) and meclizine (Antivert, Bonine). These tips may help you feel better when you have motion sickness: Eat a few dry soda crackers. After symptoms start, you may feel better only after the motion stops. These general tips may help you avoid motion sickness: Move your head as little as possible. To avoid motion sickness when you travel by car: Sit in the front seat. When you travel by airplane: Ask for a seat near the wings. Eat small meals of foods that are easy to digest before and during a long flight. When you travel by ship or boat: Book a cabin near the middle of a ship and near the waterline.

This is especially important if your doctor recommends that you monitor your blood pressure on a regular basis. There are certain factors that can cause blood pressure to temporarily rise. For example, blood pressure normally rises as a result of: Stress Smoking Cold temperatures Exercise Caffeine Certain medicines Try to avoid as many of these factors as you can when taking your blood pressure. Also, try to measure your blood pressure at about the same time each day. Your doctor may want you to check your blood pressure several times during the day to see if it fluctuates. Find a quiet place to check your blood pressure. Make sure that you are comfortable and relaxed with a recently emptied bladder (a full bladder may affect your reading). Rest in a chair next to a table for 5 to 10 minutes. Sit up straight with your back against the chair, legs uncrossed. Rest your forearm on the table with the palm of your hand facing up.

Simply reverse the sides to take a blood pressure in your right arm. Locate your pulse Locate your pulse by lightly pressing your index and middle fingers slightly to the inside center of the bend of your elbow (where the brachial artery is). If you cannot locate your pulse, place the head of the stethoscope (on a manual monitor) or the arm cuff (on a digital monitor) in the same general area. Secure the cuff Slide the cuff onto your arm, making sure that the stethoscope head is over the artery (when using a manual monitor.) The cuff may be marked with an arrow to show the location of the stethoscope head. Use the fabric fastener to make the cuff snug, but not too tight. Inflate and deflate the cuff If you are using a manual monitor: Hold the pressure gauge in your left hand and the bulb in your right. Keeping your eyes on the gauge, slowly release the pressure in the cuff by opening the airflow valve counterclockwise. (You may need to practice turning the valve slowly.) As soon as you hear it, note the reading on the gauge. This reading is your systolic pressure (the force of the blood against the artery walls as your heart beats). As soon as you can no longer hear your pulse, note the reading on the gauge. This reading is your diastolic pressure (the blood pressure between heartbeats). You'll get the most accurate reading if your arm is held straight. If you released the pressure too quickly or could not hear your pulse, DO NOT inflate the cuff again right away. If you are using a digital monitor: Hold the bulb in your right hand. All display symbols should appear briefly, followed by a zero. If you have a monitor with automatic cuff inflation, press the start button. For some devices, values may appear on the left, then on the right. Systolic pressure (the force of the blood against the artery walls as your heart beats) appears on the left and diastolic pressure (the blood pressure between heartbeats) on the right. Record your blood pressure. Follow your doctor's instructions on when and how often you should measure your blood pressure. Record the date, time, systolic and diastolic pressures. You should also record any special circumstances like any recent exercise, meal, or stressful event. At least once a year, and especially after you first purchase your blood pressure monitor, bring your monitor with you to your doctor's visit to check the machine's accuracy.

Even though it isn't an embryo, this growth triggers symptoms of pregnancy. About 1 out of 1,500 women with early pregnancy symptoms has a molar pregnancy. Molar pregnancy is thought to be caused by a problem with the genetic information of an egg or sperm. There are two types of molar pregnancy: complete and partial. It does not develop into a fetus but continues to grow as a lump of abnormal tissue that looks a bit like a cluster of grapes and can fill the uterus. Any fetal tissue that forms is likely to have severe defects. Sometimes a pregnancy that seems to be twins is found to be one fetus and one molar pregnancy. Things that may increase your risk of having a molar pregnancy include: Age. The risk for complete molar pregnancy steadily increases after age 35. A history of molar pregnancy, especially if you've had two or more. Women who don't get enough of these vitamins have a higher rate of complete molar pregnancy. A molar pregnancy causes the same early symptoms that a normal pregnancy does, such as a missed period or morning sickness. Vaginal discharge of tissue that is shaped like grapes. Your doctor can confirm a molar pregnancy with: A pelvic exam. A molar pregnancy can cause heavy bleeding from the uterus. Some molar pregnancies lead to gestational trophoblastic disease, a growth of abnormal tissue inside the uterus. Sometimes this tissue keeps growing after the molar pregnancy is removed. Complete molar pregnancies: Out of 1000 cases of complete molar pregnancy, 150 to 200 develop trophoblastic disease that keeps growing after the tissue is removed. This means that in the other 800 to 850 cases, this doesn't happen. Partial molar pregnancies: Out of 1000 cases of partial molar pregnancy, about 50 develop trophoblastic disease. This means that in 950 cases out of 1000, this doesn't happen. In a few cases, trophoblastic disease turns into cancer. In rare cases, the abnormal tissue can spread to other parts of the body. When you have a molar pregnancy, you need treatment right away to remove all of the growth from your uterus. The growth is removed with a procedure called vacuum aspiration. If you are done having children, you may decide to have your uterus removed (hysterectomy) instead of having a vacuum aspiration to treat your molar pregnancy. After treatment, you will have regular blood tests to look for signs of trophoblastic disease. If you do get trophoblastic disease, there's a small chance that it will turn into cancer. In the rare case when the cancer has had time to spread to other parts of the body, more chemotherapy is needed, sometimes combined with radiation treatment.

In people who have AIDS or other conditions that affect the immune system, the lesions associated with molluscum contagiosum can be extensive and especially chronic. Diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum is based on the distinctive appearance of the lesion. If the diagnosis is in question, a doctor can confirm the diagnosis with a skin biopsy -- the removal of a portion of skin for closer examination. To prevent molluscum contagiosum, follow these tips: Avoid direct contact skin-to-skin with anyone who may have the condition.

The symptoms of MMP vary among affected individuals depending upon the specific site(s) involved and the progression of the disease. MMP has been known by many different names within the medical literature including benign mucous membrane pemphigoid, cicatricial (scarring) pemphigoid, and ocular cicatricial pemphigoid. In March of 2002, a consensus group of researchers determined that mucous membrane pemphigoid was the best designation for this group of disorders. The term \"benign\" mucous membrane pemphigoid was deemed inappropriate because of the potential for serious complications in some cases.

You can work with your doctor to treat and manage your symptoms so you can stay healthy and continue to live the life you want. Blurred or double vision Thinking problems Clumsiness or a lack of coordination Loss of balance Numbness Tingling Weakness in an arm or leg No two people have exactly the same symptoms of MS. You may have a single symptom, and then go months or years without any others. A problem can also happen just one time, go away, and never return. These are the most common changes to the mind and body in someone with MS. Keep in mind that the severity of symptoms varies greatly and many people go years with only mild symptoms that come and go. They may also have numbness, itching, burning, stabbing, or tearing pains. About half of people with MS have these uncomfortable symptoms. Bladder problems: About 8 in 10 people have bladder problems, which can be treated. You may need to urinate more often, need to go at night, or have trouble emptying your bladder fully. Balance problems, numb feet, and fatigue can also make walking more difficult. It often comes on in the afternoon and causes weak muscles, slowed thinking, or sleepiness. Both men and women may be less responsive to touch, have a lower sex drive, or have trouble reaching orgasm. Speech problems: Sometimes MS can cause people to pause a long time in between words and have slurred or nasal speech. Some people also develop swallowing problems in more advanced stages of MS. Thinking problems: About half of people with MS have trouble concentrating that comes and goes. Rarely, people can have severe problems that make it hard to do daily tasks. Vision problems: Problems with your eyes tend to be one of the first symptoms. Your sight may be blurry, gray, or have a dark spot in the center. Very rarely, people with MS may have breathing problems or seizures. Doctors divide the symptoms into three groups: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary symptoms come from damage to the protective sheath (myelin) around the nerves in your spine or brain. This process can lead to bladder or bowel problems, loss of balance, numbness, paralysis, tingling, tremors, vision problems, or weakness. Medications, physical therapy, and other treatments can keep many of these problems under control. Secondary symptoms follow the main problems of MS. For instance, not being able to empty your bladder can lead to a bladder infection. Tertiary symptoms are the social, psychological, and job-related problems of living with MS. For instance, if MS makes it hard for you to walk or drive, you may not be able to do your job well. Because MS varies so much, it's best not to compare yourself with other people who have MS.

Sialidosis type II is usually more severe than sialidosis type I. Type II often begins during infancy or later during childhood and is characterized by cherry-red macules, mildly coarse facial features, skeletal malformations and mild cognitive impairment.

It's contagious, but you're less likely to catch mono than other illnesses like the common cold. The symptoms of mono can be mild, but they can also become very severe. It's possible to be infected with EBV and carry it in your body for your entire life without ever having symptoms of mono. EBV is part of the herpes virus family, and it's one of the most common viruses you can get. Usually, the infection happens before a child becomes a teen. EBV is the most common cause of mono, but other viruses can cause it too. You can also get it if you share food, drinks, or silverware with a person who has it, or if an infected person coughs or sneezes near you. As long as an object -- like a fork or spoon -- that an infected person used is still moist, the virus is probably still present and contagious. So although it's less likely, you can get mono from medical procedures such as blood transfusions and organ transplants, or through sexual contact. If you've never been infected with EBV and you get it, you may start to have symptoms of mono within about 4 to 7 weeks. You could develop a fever, fatigue, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, or other symptoms, like sore muscles and a loss of appetite. Mono can cause different combinations of symptoms in different people. In some cases, it can take 6 months or longer for the symptoms to go away. If it becomes severe, your spleen can rupture and cause a sudden, sharp pain on the left side of your upper abdomen. Mono can also cause complications that affect your liver, including hepatitis or jaundice. It's less likely, but mono can also cause problems with your heart and nervous system, and anemia. You're more likely to develop serious complications from mono if your immune system is compromised because of an illness like HIV/AIDS or because you take certain medications. EBV can stay in your saliva for months after you're infected, so even if you don't have symptoms or feel sick, you may be able to spread it. To lower your chance of getting it, wash your hands often and try not to share such things as drinks or silverware with other people."], [214, "Mitral Valve Stenosis", "Mitral valve stenosis is a heart problem in which the mitral valve doesn't open as wide as it should. The valve becomes stiff or scarred, or the valve flaps become partially joined together. Mitral valve stenosis can lead to heart failure; a stroke; an infection in the heart (endocarditis); or a fast, slow, or uneven heartbeat (arrhythmia). Fortunately, mitral valve stenosis can be treated. Mitral valve stenosis is not common in developed countries such as the United States, Canada, and western Europe. Your heart has four chambers and four valves. With mitral valve stenosis, not as much blood can flow into the left ventricle. Nearly all cases of mitral valve stenosis are caused by rheumatic fever. Mitral valve stenosis is a lifelong disease, but symptoms may not happen for many years. When symptoms first appear, they usually are mild. You may only have a few symptoms, even if your mitral valve is very narrow. An early symptom is shortness of breath when you are active. Symptoms later in the disease may include: Shortness of breath even when you have not been very active or when you are resting. Call your doctor if your symptoms get worse or you have new symptoms. Mitral valve stenosis may not be diagnosed until you've had the disease for some time. If you don't have symptoms, the first clue might be a heart murmur your doctor hears during a routine checkup. This ultrasound test lets your doctor see a picture of your heart, including the mitral valve. This shows your heart and lungs and can help your doctor find the cause of symptoms such as shortness of breath. You'll probably need only regular checkups if you have mild or moderate stenosis. You may need your mitral valve repaired or replaced if you have severe symptoms, your valve is very narrow, or you are at risk for other problems, such as heart failure. You will likely need regular echocardiograms so your doctor can check for any changes in your mitral valve and heart. You can make lifestyle changes to keep your heart healthy. If your stenosis is mild, you'll probably be able to do your usual activities, get mild exercise, and play some sports. But if your stenosis is moderate or severe, you may need to avoid intense exercise. But your doctor can help you choose an activity or exercise that is safe for you. Stay at a healthy weight, or lose weight if you need to."], [215, "Mitral Valve Regurgitation", "Mitral valve regurgitation means that one of the valves in your heart-the mitral valve-is letting blood leak backward into the heart. Heart valves work like one-way gates, helping blood flow in one direction between heart chambers or in and out of the heart. The mitral valve is on the left side of your heart. It lets blood flow from the upper to the lower heart chamber. See a picture of mitral valve regurgitation . When the mitral valve is damaged-for example, by an infection-it may no longer close tightly. This lets blood leak backward, or regurgitate, into the upper chamber. Your heart has to work harder to pump this extra blood. There are two forms of mitral valve regurgitation: chronic and acute. Chronic mitral valve regurgitation, the most common type, develops slowly. Primary regurgitation means there is a problem with the anatomy of the valve. This might happen because of problems like calcium buildup on the valve. It can also happen in people who have mitral valve prolapse.Secondary regurgitation means another heart problem causes the valve to not close tightly. The heart problem, such as heart failure, affects the heart muscle, and this causes regurgitation. Primary regurgitation means there is a problem with the anatomy of the valve. This might happen because of problems like calcium buildup on the valve. It can also happen in people who have mitral valve prolapse. Secondary regurgitation means another heart problem causes the valve to not close tightly. The heart problem, such as heart failure, affects the heart muscle, and this causes regurgitation. Acute mitral valve regurgitation develops quickly and can be life-threatening. Instead of a slow leak, blood builds up quickly in the left side of the heart. Your heart doesn't have time to adjust to this sudden buildup of blood the way it does with the slow buildup of blood in chronic regurgitation. Common causes of acute regurgitation are heart attack and a heart infection called endocarditis. Symptoms of mitral valve regurgitation include being tired or short of breath when you are active. If your heart weakens because of your mitral valve, you may start to have symptoms of heart failure. A buildup of fluid in the legs and feet, called edema. Acute mitral valve regurgitation is an emergency. Because you may not have symptoms, a specific type of heart murmur may be the first sign your doctor notices. You may take medicine to treat a heart problem that is causing the regurgitation. You may need surgery to repair or replace your mitral valve. These things include the cause of the regurgitation, the anatomy of the valve, if you have symptoms, and how well your heart is pumping blood. If you have chronic mitral valve regurgitation, your doctor may want you to make some lifestyle changes to help keep your heart healthy.

Missed or irregular periods must be looked at in terms of what is normal for you. Menstrual periods are often irregular during the first few years after menstruation starts. Menstrual periods also may be very irregular at the other end of the menstrual years. Many women realize that they are approaching perimenopause and menopause when their otherwise regular periods become irregular. If you might be pregnant, treat yourself as if you are pregnant until you know for sure. If you are not pregnant, other causes of missed or irregular periods include: Excessive weight loss or gain. Although low body weight is a common cause of missed or irregular periods, obesity also can cause menstrual problems. For more information, see the topic Anorexia Nervosa or Bulimia Nervosa. Missed periods are common in endurance athletes. Medicines such as birth control methods, which may cause lighter, less frequent, more frequent, or skipped periods or no periods at all. This may cause a change in the levels of the hormones that the body needs to support menstruation. Problems with the pelvic organs , such as imperforate hymen, polycystic ovary syndrome, or Asherman's syndrome. Remember, you can still become pregnant even though you are not menstruating. Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy to the abdomen or pelvis may cause premature ovarian failure. Other diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, tuberculosis, liver disease, and diabetes can cause missed or irregular periods, although this is rare. But if any of these diseases are present, you will usually have other symptoms besides menstrual irregularities. Restoring your life to emotional and physical balance can help. Many women miss periods now and then."], [218, "Misophonia", "Imagine if a sound could make you panic or fly into a rage. This is the case with misophonia -- a strong dislike or hatred of specific sounds. It's often an oral sound -- the noise someone makes when they eat, breathe, chew, yawn, or whistle. Sometimes a small repetitive motion is the cause -- someone fidgets, jostles you, or wiggles their foot. If you have a mild reaction, you might feel: Anxious Uncomfortable The urge to flee Disgust If your response is more severe, the sound in question might cause: Rage Anger Hatred Panic Fear Emotional distress A desire to kill or stop whatever is making the noise Skin crawling Suicidal thoughts The disease can put a cramp in your social life. You might avoid restaurants or eat separately from your spouse, family, or roommates. You might attack the person who's making the sound -- physical or verbally -- cry, or run away from the situation. Seeing someone get ready to eat or put something in their mouth might set you off. Doctors aren't sure what causes misophonia, but it's not a problem with your ears. It could be related to how sound affects your brain and triggers automatic responses in your body. Because your ears are normal and your hearing is OK, the doctor may have trouble with a diagnosis. The condition does affect daily life, but you can learn to manage it. More than a dozen misophonia clinics around the country offer sound therapy combined with psychological counseling. The doctor sets up background noises to counteract your trigger sound. You might try a device like a hearing aid that creates a sound in your ear similar to a waterfall. You can also wear ear plugs and headsets to tune out sounds. Set up quiet areas or safe spots in your home where no one will make the noises that bother you."], [219, "Miscarriage", "A miscarriage is the loss of a fetus before the 20th week of pregnancy. The medical term for a miscarriage is spontaneous abortion, but \"spontaneous\" is the key word here because the condition is not an abortion in the common definition of the term. According to the March of Dimes, as many as 50% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage -- most often before a woman misses a menstrual period or even knows she is pregnant. Symptoms of a miscarriage include: Bleeding which progresses from light to heavy Severe cramps Abdominal pain Fever Weakness Back pain If you experience the symptoms listed above, contact your obstetric health care provider right away. Most miscarriages happen when the unborn baby has fatal genetic problems. Other causes of miscarriage include: Infection Medical conditions in the mother, such as diabetes or thyroid disease Hormone problems Immune system responses Physical problems in the mother Uterine abnormalities A woman has a higher risk of miscarriage if she: Is over age 35 Has certain diseases, such as diabetes or thyroid problems Has had three or more miscarriages Cervical Insufficiency A miscarriage sometimes happens because there is a weakness of the cervix, called an incompetent cervix, which cannot hold the pregnancy. A miscarriage from an incompetent cervix usually occurs in the second trimester. There are usually few symptoms before a miscarriage caused by cervical insufficiency. An incompetent cervix can usually be treated with a \"circling\" stitch in the cervix in the next pregnancy, usually around 12 weeks. The stitch holds the cervix closed until it is pulled out around the time of delivery. The stitch may also be placed even if there has not been a previous miscarriage if cervical insufficiency is discovered early enough, before a miscarriage does occur. If the miscarriage is complete and the uterus is empty, then no further treatment is usually required. Occasionally, the uterus is not completely emptied, so a dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) procedure is performed. During this procedure, the cervix is dilated and any remaining fetal or placental tissue is gently removed from the uterus. As an alternative to a D&amp;C, certain medications can be given to cause your body to expel the contents in the uterus. Blood work to determine the amount of a pregnancy hormone (hCG) is checked to monitor the progress of the miscarriage. If the cervix is dilated, you may be diagnosed with an incompetent cervix and a procedure to close the cervix (called cerclage) may be performed if the pregnancy is still viable. If your blood type is Rh negative, your doctor may give you a blood product called Rh immune globulin (Rhogam). Blood tests, genetic tests, or medication may be necessary if a woman has more than two miscarriages in a row (called recurrent miscarriage). Some diagnostic procedures used to evaluate the cause of repeated miscarriage include pelvic ultrasound, hysterosalpingogram (an X-ray of the uterus and fallopian tubes), and hysteroscopy (a test in which the doctor views the inside of the uterus with a thin, telescope-like device inserted through the vagina and cervix). On the other hand, about 1%-2% of women may have repeated miscarriages (three or more). If you've had two miscarriages in a row, you should stop trying to conceive, use a form of birth control, and ask your health care provider to perform diagnostic tests to determine the cause of the miscarriages. To prevent another miscarriage, your health care provider may recommend treatment with progesterone, a hormone needed for implantation and early support of a pregnancy in the uterus. Usually a miscarriage cannot be prevented and often occurs because the pregnancy is not normal. Sometimes, treatment of a mother's illness can improve the chances for a successful pregnancy."], [220, "Mirror-Image Dextrocardia", "Dextrocardia with Situs Inversus is a rare heart condition characterized by abnormal positioning of the heart.

People use milk thistle as a complementary treatment for liver problems, particularly hepatitis and cirrhosis and inflammation of the bile ducts (cholangitis). But it does not have a direct effect on viruses that cause hepatitis, such as the hepatitis C virus.1 Preliminary research suggests that silymarin is an antioxidant, which helps protect the body from cell-destroying substances called free radicals. Silymarin also may reduce inflammation and block the effects of toxins that harm the liver.2 Two studies on milk thistle presented conflicting results. One study found that milk thistle appeared to help some people with cirrhosis live longer than they would have otherwise, while another found no benefit.2 Milk thistle may cause nausea, diarrhea, bloating, pain, or allergies.

Being lactose intolerant is not the same as being allergic to milk. But people with lactose intolerance don't have enough lactase. Even with low levels of lactase, some people can digest milk products just fine. For people who are lactose intolerant, their low lactase levels gives them symptoms after they eat dairy. But people who are lactose intolerant don't have it so easy. It can cause things like gas, bloating and diarrhea. There are some steps you can take to test yourself: Go without milk or milk products for a couple of weeks. If your symptoms disappear, bring dairy products back into your diet a little at a time to take note of how you react. If your symptoms continue after cutting out the dairy -- or if they return -- see your doctor to find out what's going on.

The middle ear is the small part of your ear behind your eardrum. A small tube connects your ear to your throat. A cold can cause this tube to swell. When the tube swells enough to become blocked, it can trap fluid inside your ear. Ear infections happen mostly to young children, because their tubes are smaller and get blocked more easily. They may pull at their ears and cry. You may see thick, yellow fluid coming from their ears. This happens when the infection has caused the eardrum to burst and the fluid flows out. They may have trouble hearing, but their hearing usually returns to normal after the fluid is gone. It may take weeks for the fluid to drain away. Your doctor will talk to you about your child's symptoms. Most ear infections go away on their own, although antibiotics are recommended for children under the age of 2 and for children at high risk for complications. You can treat your child at home with an over-the-counter pain reliever like acetaminophen (such as Tylenol), a warm washcloth on the ear, and rest. Your doctor may give you eardrops that can help your child's pain. Your doctor can give your child antibiotics, but ear infections often get better without them. Whether you use them will depend on how old your child is and how bad the infection is. Minor surgery to put tubes in the ears may help if your child has hearing problems or repeat infections. Sometimes after an infection, a child cannot hear well for a while. Call your doctor if this lasts for 3 to 4 months. Children need to be able to hear in order to learn how to talk.

When it spreads to other places in your body, it's called metastatic, or advanced. You may also hear your doctor refer to it as stage IV melanoma. Melanoma often spreads to: Tissue under the skin Lymph nodes Lungs Liver Brain Although in most cases it can't be cured, treatments and support can help you live longer and better. And researchers are working to find new medications that can do even more. Remember: You still have control over the decisions you make about your treatment and your life. It's important to have people you can talk to about your plans, your fears, and your feelings. In most cases, melanoma is caused by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds. It damages the DNA of your skin cells, and they start to grow out of control. You can get the disease on parts of your body that don't get sunlight, though, like the palms of your hands and the retinas of your eyes. You're more likely to get melanoma if you have: Fair skin, along with lighter hair and eye color Many moles or irregular moles (not beauty marks or small brown blemishes) A family history of melanoma If your melanoma has spread to other areas, you may have: Hardened lumps under your skin Swollen or painful lymph nodes Trouble breathing, or a cough that doesn't go away Swelling of your liver (under your lower right ribs) or loss of appetite Bone pain or, less often, broken bones Headaches, seizures, or weakness or numbness in your arms or legs Weight loss Fatigue Before you have any tests, your doctor will want to know: Why did you come in? Has anyone in your family had melanoma? If you haven't already been diagnosed with melanoma, your doctor will do a skin exam. If he thinks you may have skin cancer, you'll need a biopsy to find out. You usually get one of two types: Punch biopsy. A doctor will look at the growth under a microscope to see how thick it is. If you've been diagnosed with melanoma, you may also have a blood test and an imaging test to see if it has spread to other areas. This uses radiation in low doses to make pictures of the inside of your body. It uses powerful X-rays so your doctor can get a detailed look at what's going on inside you. The doctor will also check to see if your lymph nodes are enlarged. Lymph nodes are bean-sized glands under the skin in your neck, underarms, and groin. The doctor uses a thin needle to remove a sample of cells. The doctor may also do a sentinel node biopsy. This removes the lymph nodes most likely to have cancer cells. In this test, the doctor injects a dye into the area where the potential cancer was. It spreads to the nearest lymph nodes, which are removed and tested. If these lymph nodes, called sentinel nodes, don't have cancer, then it's likely the cancer hasn't spread. The results of these tests help the doctor determine the stage of your cancer and how widespread it is. You and he will decide on the best treatment plan once you know that information. Do you have experience treating metastatic melanoma? Although metastatic melanoma is not easy to treat, you do have options. Choosing what's right for you will depend on where and how big the cancer is, what your health is like, and what your wishes are. Since most cases of metastatic melanoma can't be cured, the goals of treatment are to: Shrink or stop the growth of the disease where it has spread. Your doctor may remove tumors or lymph glands. Although surgery alone probably won't cure the cancer, it can help you live longer and have fewer symptoms. Your doctor will likely also use one or more other treatments. You get immunotherapy through an IV or a shot in high doses. It can be given to individuals who have had surgery to remove melanoma in order to prevent the melanoma from coming back. But the drug doesn't work for everyone, and it can have serious, even life-threatening, side effects. Nivolumab (Opdivo): It works by inhibiting the PD-1 protein on cells, which blocks the body's immune system from attacking melanoma tumors. Pembrolizumab (Keytruda): In people with advanced melanoma who have already been treated with Yervoy, Keytruda may shrink tumors in some. Researchers are studying many other drugs that spur the immune system to fight melanoma. Because metastatic melanoma is so hard to treat, you may want to ask your doctor about taking part in a clinical trial, which uses a treatment that's still under research. If you have a tumor with BRAF, these drugs may shrink it and extend your life. They include: Dabrafenib (Tafinlar) Vemurafenib (Zelboraf) Other drugs block an enzyme called MEK. These drugs, working in combination with a BRAF inhibitor to attack cancer cells, seem to shrink tumors for a longer period of time: Cobimetinib (Cotellic) Trametinib (Mekinist) Hearing that your cancer has spread is scary, but a lot of research is underway to find new treatments. And there are treatments available to try to stop the disease from spreading any more, so you can live longer. It's important to have support and to talk about your fears and feelings, too. Your doctor can help you find a cancer support group. These tips may help you feel better during melanoma treatment: If you lose your appetite, eat small amounts of food every 2 to 3 hours instead of bigger meals. A dietitian can give you other tips on nutrition and eating during your cancer treatment. But listen to your body, and balance rest and activity. It could be from family, friends, your cancer support group, or a religious group. Although stage IV melanoma is hard to treat, each case is different, and some people will respond very well to treatment. Talk to your doctor about all your options, and find out more about clinical trials to see if one is right for you. The Melanoma Research Foundation has an online library of free support services, including an online patient community and a phone buddy program.

It happens when there's too much pressure on or damage to one of the nerves in your leg. In most cases, there are simple ways to treat the condition, such as wearing looser clothing. With the right treatment and enough time to recover, you can ease your symptoms and feel better. Usually, you'll notice the warning signs of meralgia paresthetica only on one side of your body. You might feel: Pain, tingling, numbness, or burning in the outside of your thigh Sensitivity to light touch rather than to firm pressure High sensitivity to heat Your symptoms may be mild at first, but as the condition gets worse, you might feel sharper, shooting pain. Nerves travel throughout your body, carrying messages to and from your brain. A certain set of nerves, called the sensory nerves, gather and send signals to your brain about your skin, muscles, and other tissues. If you have meralgia paresthetica, a large sensory nerve in your outer thigh doesn't have enough room to pass through your hip bone or joints. A lot of things can squeeze or damage the nerve, including: Weight gain and obesity Tight clothing Pregnancy Injury, such as trauma from a seatbelt during a car crash A disease that can damage the nerves, like diabetes Repetitive motions that could irritate the nerve, such as certain leg movements Standing or walking for a long time Your doctor will give you a physical exam and ask about your symptoms and your medical history -- especially about any recent injuries or surgeries. The doctor will touch your leg to find the affected area. The doctor may also do some tests, including: Imaging tests of your leg and hip, such as X-rays or MRI. They're attached by wires to a machine that can measure the electricity in your muscles and nerves. Your doctor will ask you to slowly flex and relax your leg so the machine can record the activity. Usually, your doctor will put two sensors on the skin over the nerve in your thigh, one to give a small electric shock and the other to record the activity.

Lymph accumulates in the tiny spaces between tissue cells and contains proteins, fats, and certain white blood cells known as lymphocytes. As lymph moves through the lymphatic system, it is filtered by a network of small structures known as lymph nodes that help to remove microorganisms (e.g., viruses, bacteria, etc.) In addition to the lymph nodes, the lymphatic system includes the spleen, which filters worn-out red blood cells and produces lymphocytes, and the tonsils, which are masses of lymphoid tissue in the throat region that help to fight infection. Lymphatic tissues also include the thymus, a relatively small organ behind the breastbone that is thought to play an important role in the immune system until puberty, as well as the bone marrow, which is the spongy tissue inside the cavities of bones that manufactures blood cells. Lymphatic tissue or circulating lymphocytes may also be located in other regions of the body, such as the skin, small intestine, liver, and other organs. There are two main types of lymphocytes: B-lymphocytes, which may produce specific antibodies to \"neutralize\" certain invading microorganisms, and T-lymphocytes, which may directly destroy microorganisms or assist in the activities of other lymphocytes. Mantle cell lymphoma and other cancers of the lymphatic system (lymphomas) result from errors in the production of a lymphocyte or transformation of a lymphocyte into a malignant cell. Abnormal, uncontrolled growth and multiplication (proliferation) of malignant lymphocytes may lead to enlargement of a specific lymph node region or regions; involvement of other lymphatic tissues, such as the spleen and bone marrow; and spread to other bodily tissues and organs, potentially resulting in life-threatening complications. The specific symptoms and physical findings may vary from case to case, depending upon the extent and region(s) of involvement and other factors. Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a B-cell lymphoma that develops from malignant B-lymphocytes within a region of the lymph node known as the mantle zone.

Although it was only identified less than 20 years ago, metabolic syndrome is as widespread as pimples and the common cold . According to the American Heart Association, 47 million Americans have it. The syndrome runs in families and is more common among African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans. The risks of developing metabolic syndrome increases as you age. Indeed, metabolic syndrome seems to be a condition that many people have, but no one knows very much about. It's also debated by the experts -- not all doctors agree that metabolic syndrome should be viewed as a distinct condition. Instead, it's a group of risk factors -- high blood pressure, high blood sugar, unhealthy cholesterol levels, and abdominal fat. Obviously, having any one of these risk factors isn't good. These risk factors double your risk of blood vessel and heart disease, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. The good news is that metabolic syndrome can be controlled, largely with changes to your lifestyle. According to the American Heart Association and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, there are five risk factors that make up metabolic syndrome. To be diagnosed with metabolic syndrome, you would have at least three of these risk factors. Experts aren't sure why metabolic syndrome develops. Some risk factors are: Insulin resistance. In people with insulin resistance, the insulin doesn't work as well, so your body keeps making more and more of it to cope with the rising level of glucose. In addition, having extra fat in the belly -- as opposed to elsewhere in the body -- seems to increase your risk. For instance, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) -- a condition that affects fertility -- is related to hormonal imbalance and metabolic syndrome.

But when an expert diagnoses you and helps you get treatment, you can often get your life back on track. A combination of things, including your genes, biology, and your life experiences, seem to be involved. Some conditions involve circuits in your brain that are used in thinking, mood, and behavior. For instance, you may have too much, or not enough, activity of certain brain chemicals called \"neurotransmitters\" within those circuits. Some mental illnesses may be triggered or worsened by psychological trauma that happens when you're a child or teenager, such as: Severe emotional, physical, or sexual abuse A major loss, such as the death of a parent, early in life Neglect Major sources of stress, such as a death or divorce, problems in family relationships, job loss, school, and substance abuse, can trigger or aggravate some mental disorders in some people. It's normal to have some grief, anger, and other emotions when you have a major setback in life. There are many different mental illnesses, and their symptoms vary. Some common symptoms include: Problems with thinking (like being confused, suspicious, or unusually angry or sad) Keeping to themselves Mood swings Relationship problems Hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there) Abusing alcohol or drugs Feeling low on hope and not enjoying things that they used to like Thoughts of suicide or harming themselves or others Sleep problems (too much or too little) If you've had symptoms like these, talk to your doctor or a counselor to find out what's going on and what would help you. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, about 1 in 5 U.S. adults had a mental health issue in 2014, and 1 in 25 lived with someone who had a serious condition, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression. In many cases, people get one or more of these treatments: Medication. Prescription drugs help manage the symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, or psychosis. In some cases, changing your habits makes a difference. In some cases, treatment may also include creative therapies (such as art therapy, music therapy, or play therapy), mindfulness and meditation, and brain stimulation therapies, such as: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). You're \"asleep\" under general anesthesia while doctors put electrodes on specific points on your head to stimulate your brain. It's usually used for major depression, but doctors may consider it for other conditions, especially in severe cases. Most people get it several times a week for a few weeks, and usually only if other treatments haven't worked. Vagus nerve stimulation, in which doctors implant a device that stimulates the vagus nerve, which relays messages to areas in the brain that are thought to affect mood and thinking. It's approved to treat severe cases of depression that don't respond to two or more antidepressant treatments. Transcranial magnetic stimulation, which uses magnets (outside the body) to stimulate the brain. With early diagnosis and treatment, many people fully recover from their mental illness or can manage their symptoms.

People who have bipolar disorder can have periods in which they feel overly happy and energized and other periods of feeling very sad, hopeless, and sluggish. You can think of the highs and the lows as two \"poles\" of mood, which is why it's called \"bipolar\" disorder. The word \"manic\" describes the times when someone with bipolar disorder feels overly excited and confident. About half of people during mania can also have delusions (believing things that aren't true and that they can't be talked out of) or hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there). \"Hypomania\" describes milder symptoms of mania, in which someone does not have delusions or hallucinations, and their high symptoms do not interfere with their everyday life. The word \"depressive\" describes the times when the person feels very sad or depressed. Those symptoms are the same as those described in major depressive disorder or \"clinical depression,\" a condition in which someone never has manic or hypomanic episodes. In bipolar disorder, the dramatic episodes of high and low moods do not follow a set pattern. Someone may feel the same mood state (depressed or manic) several times before switching to the opposite mood. How severe it gets differs from person to person and can also change over time, becoming more or less severe. Symptoms of mania (\"the highs\"): Excessive happiness, hopefulness, and excitement Sudden changes from being joyful to being irritable, angry, and hostile Restlessness Rapid speech and poor concentration Increased energy and less need for sleep Unusually high sex drive Making grand and unrealistic plans Showing poor judgment Drug and alcohol abuse Becoming more impulsive During depressive periods (\"the lows\"), a person with bipolar disorder may have: Sadness Loss of energy Feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness Not enjoying things they once liked Trouble concentrating Uncontrollable crying Trouble making decisions Irritability Needing more sleep Insomnia Appetite changes that make them lose or gain weight Thoughts of death or suicide Attempting suicide When someone develops bipolar disorder, it usually starts when they're in late adolescence or young adulthood. Women are somewhat more likely than men to go through \"rapid cycling,\" which is having four or more distinct mood episodes within a year. Many people with the condition abuse alcohol or other drugs when manic or depressed. People with bipolar disorder are more likely to have seasonal depression, co-existing anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. If you or someone you know has symptoms of bipolar disorder, talk to your family doctor or a psychiatrist. They will ask questions about mental illnesses that you, or the person you're concerned about, have had, and any mental illnesses that run in the family. The person will also get a complete psychiatric evaluation to tell if they have likely bipolar disorder or another mental health condition.\" Diagnosing bipolar disorder is all about the person's symptoms and determining whether they may be the result of another cause (such as low thyroid, or mood symptoms caused by drug or alcohol abuse). The most telling symptoms are those that involve highs or lows in mood, along with changes in sleep, energy, thinking, and behavior. Talking to close friends and family of the person can often help the doctor distinguish bipolar disorder from major depressive (unipolar) disorder or other psychiatric disorders that can involve changes in mood, thinking, and behavior. Medication is the main treatment, usually involving \"mood stabilizers\" such as carbamazepine (Tegretol), lamotrigine (Lamictal), lithium, or valproate (Depakote).

Your child has a greater risk of having it if a close family member such as a parent, grandparent, brother, or sister has it. But there is nothing a parent can do to cause or prevent it. In children and teens, moods quickly change from one extreme to another without a clear reason. But for a child to have bipolar disorder, these mood changes must be different from the child's usual moods and must happen with other symptoms or changes in behavior. These distinct periods of time with changes in mood and behavior are called mood episodes. People with bipolar disorder have manic and depressive mood episodes. Times of mania (ups) or depression (downs) may be less obvious in children and teens than in adults. A manic episode lasts at least a week. It is a period of extremely happy, aggressive, and/or angry mood that occurs with some of the following symptoms. The child or teen may: Have little need for sleep.Have high energy levels.Have extreme confidence in themselves.Talk very fast.Have many thoughts at once. Seem very distracted and unable to focus.Touch his or her genitals, use sexual language, and approach others in a sexual way.Act inappropriate or are intrusive in social settings. Touch his or her genitals, use sexual language, and approach others in a sexual way. Act inappropriate or are intrusive in social settings.

Not find pleasure in things they normally enjoy. This disorder can be hard to diagnose in children and teens. The symptoms can look a lot like the symptoms of other problems, such as: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Alcohol and drug abuse problems. If your doctor thinks your child or teen may have bipolar disorder, he or she may ask questions about your child's feelings and behavior. Your doctor may also give you and your child written tests to find out how severe the mania or depression is. The doctor may do other tests (such as a blood test) to rule out other health problems. These include alcohol and drug abuse, trouble in school, running away from home, fighting, and even suicide. Warning signs of suicide in children and teens may include thinking too much about death or suicide. Watch also for things that can trigger a suicide attempt such as a recent breakup of a relationship or the loss of a parent or close family member through death or divorce. The mood changes that come with bipolar disorder can be a challenge. An important part of treatment is making sure your child takes his or her medicine. But without medicine, their symptoms usually come back. Medicines for bipolar disorder in adults have been well studied. But more research is being done on how the medicines work and if they are safe for children and teens. Keeping a consistent sleep-wake schedule is an important first step in managing bipolar disorder. Set a regular sleep-wake schedule for your child, to make sure they go to bed and wake up the same time every day, even on weekends. The disorder can be a serious, lifelong problem. Your child will need long-term treatment and will need to be watched carefully. By working with your child's doctor, you can find a treatment that works for your child.

Although it is possible to delay or postpone grieving, it is not possible to avoid grieving altogether. Give yourself all the time you need to identify, accept, and express your emotions. Each person handles emotions and feelings differently. Find the way to deal with your emotions that fits you. Support comes in many forms, such as from friends and family, by participating in activities you enjoy, or through exercises to help you express your feelings, such as writing letters or keeping a journal. Stimulate thinking and help you organize and analyze your thoughts. Deepen your understanding of a situation and may help you get in touch with feelings you had not recognized before. This can help you put things into perspective and come to an understanding of how the changes affect your life. Don't worry about how well you write. Strong feelings (such as fear, anger, or frustration) may arise. If you have concerns about your strong feelings, talk with a trusted friend, member of the clergy, or mental health professional. If you are having trouble talking about your feelings with family members and friends, consider joining a bereavement support group. You may feel that this is a sign of weakness, or that you won't be able to control yourself if you show your emotions. However, if you are afraid that you might harm yourself or someone else if you express an emotion, talk with someone you trust, your health professional, or a mental health professional about your concerns. Your feelings may be unpredictable and uncomfortable. Remind yourself that your uncomfortable feelings are expected and will fade as time goes on.

If you wear glasses, keeping your lens prescription current can help you adapt to your vision problems. Visual aids and adaptive technologies can help you work, communicate, and travel. These include magnifying lenses, special video cameras to enlarge pictures or print, large-print books and newspapers, and adaptive appliances. Counseling, rehabilitation, and training can help you with managing your household, cooking, shopping, personal grooming, and other aspects of daily home and work life. If your low vision prevents you from driving, you can explore other ways to get around, such as riding with family and friends, using public transportation, or taking taxis. Building a personal support network can help you keep or improve your quality of life and cope with your vision problems. Make simple accommodations at home that will help you manage your household chores and care for your personal needs. Use low-vision aids and adaptive technology, such as lenses and other devices, to enhance your remaining vision. Position lighting so that it is aimed at what you want to see, and aimed away from your eyes. Add table and floor lamps in areas where extra lighting is often needed. Use window coverings that let you adjust the level of natural lighting. Make sure that potentially hazardous areas such as entries and stairways are well lit. For example, if you have white or light-colored walls, use dark switch plates for your light switches. Or use lighted switches that glow softly. You can also use paint in a contrasting color to mark electrical outlets, oven dials, thermostats, and other items. This will make the items easier to find and use. Paint door frames in a contrasting color. For example, if the door is light, paint the frame with a dark color. In your bathroom, use contrasting color for items such as cups, soap dishes, and even the soap. Use high contrast when you make labels, signs, and other markings. Use colored, high-contrast labels to \"color code\" medicines, spices, foods, and other items. Label any medicines you take so that they are easily and clearly identified. You can also wrap rubber bands around each of your medicine bottles. Use a different amount of bands for each medicine, and keep track of the number of bands on each medicine type. Then, feel for the number of bands when you need to take a certain medicine. Mark the positions of the temperature settings you use most frequently on your stove and oven controls, as well as the \"on\" and \"off\" positions. In the kitchen and bathroom, mark the settings for the faucets that provide the right water temperature. To prevent overfilling a sink or bathtub, mark the water level you want with a strip of waterproof tape or a waterproof marker. A high-contrast color such as dark tape on light carpeting works best. Attach a safety pin to the labels of clothes that have similar colors. If you use throw rugs or area rugs, tape them down or remove them. Arrange your furniture so that it doesn't stick out into areas where you need to walk. Keep chairs pushed in under tables and desks when they are not being used. Consider installing handrails in other potentially hazardous areas. For distance vision, small handheld telescopes or lenses that clip onto your eyeglasses may be used. These are electronic systems that can be used to send an enlarged image of print, pictures, or other items onto a screen where it is easier for you to see. These systems can also sometimes adjust brightness and contrast to make the enlarged image easier to see. Large screens and software that enlarge print, pictures, and other visual information are available. Computers also allow you to alter brightness, contrast, color, and other parts of the display. They can help you locate and stick the needle through the rubber stopper on your insulin bottle and help you prepare mixed- or single-dose insulin injections. There are also bottle-holding devices that help you hold the bottle and syringe to safely withdraw insulin. There are devices to help you draw the same amount of insulin every time. Insulin pens that show the units by clicking or have large-print markings can be used to give insulin that comes in a cartridge. A large-print meter can help you see your blood sugar result clearly. If you need to weigh your food, there are large-print or talking food scales. You can also estimate portion sizes by other means. For example, you can use your hand to judge portion sizes. Most home blood sugar meter companies have computer software that allows your blood sugar results to be entered directly into a computer. You can also print these in large print so that you can read the records. You can speak your daily blood sugar results and other information directly into a tape recorder. Books, newspapers, magazines, medicine labels, bank checks, and playing cards are often available in large print. Many people with low vision also use audio versions of books and other printed materials. These may be something as simple as paper with extra-bold lines that help you write information on checks in the proper spaces. These are common household items that have been adapted for use by people with low vision. Or you can find clocks, telephones, and home appliances with extra-large buttons and numerals that can be seen more easily. OCR systems allow you to scan documents and convert them into computer text. Ask a friend to read you the instructions for a new exercise and to check your technique. If you swim laps, use a pool that has ropes between the lanes. Also see if your area has paratransit services that can take you door-to-door where you need to go. But don't forget that it also costs a lot to own a car, buy gas, and pay for insurance and maintenance.

Certain antihistamines like doxylamine or dimenhydrinate, taken as your doctor advises, may relieve morning sickness. If one of these antihistamines alone does not relieve your morning sickness, you can try taking it with vitamin B6.1 Ginger, taken regularly as a powder in a capsule, grated fresh into hot water for a tea, or in syrup or crystallized form, may relieve morning sickness after a few days of treatment.2 Vitamin B6, taken regularly as your doctor advises, may reduce nausea and vomiting. Acupressure, firmly placed on the P6 point (the inner side of your arm, in line with your middle finger and one-sixth of the way between your wrist and elbow), relieves nausea for some women. Keep food in your stomach but not too much. For morning nausea, eat a small snack (like crackers) before you get out of bed. Allow a few minutes for the snack to digest, then get out of bed slowly. Try a sports hydration drink, as well as water, broth, or juice. Eat more protein, and cut your fatty food intake. Citrus juice, milk, coffee, and caffeinated tea commonly make nausea worse. If you are taking iron supplements, ask your doctor if they are necessary. Iron can make nausea worse. Stress and fatigue can make morning sickness worse."], [258, "Managing Job Stress", "Job stress comes in different forms and affects your mind and body in different ways. Small things can make you feel stressed, such as a copy machine that never seems to work when you need it or phones that won't quit ringing. Major stress comes from having too much or not enough work or doing work that doesn't satisfy you. Conflicts with your boss, coworkers, or customers are other major causes of stress. Stress releases hormones that speed up your heart, make you breathe faster, and give you a burst of energy. It can make chronic pain worse and can also lead to long-term health problems such as heart disease, high blood pressure, back problems, and depression. Look for these signs of job stress: Headaches Trouble sleeping Problems concentrating Short temper Upset stomach Job dissatisfaction and low morale Most of the time, it's the major sources of stress that lead to job burnout and health problems. Job stress can affect your home life too. Here are some common sources of major job stress, with examples of each: Lack of control. Feeling as if you have no control over your work or job duties is the biggest cause of job stress. Here's an example: Shelly is responsible for putting together a report that her boss must deliver at a 4 p.m. meeting. She's been waiting all day for the notes and numbers she needs. Shelly finally gets the notes from her boss at 3:15 and rushes to prepare the report and charts and to make copies in time. She gets it done, but she feels mad and resentful. This is the third time this week that this has happened. Taking on extra duties in your job is stressful. You can get more stressed if you have too much work to do and you can't say no to new tasks. John volunteers for every new project, because he heard that's the best way to get promoted. But this morning, John's boss asked him to take on another project, and John agreed. If your job isn't meaningful, you may find it stressful. Feeling insecure about job performance is a major source of stress for many people. Being unsure about your duties, how your job might be changing, or the goals of your department or company can lead to stress. If you report to more than one boss, juggling the demands of different managers can also be stressful. She's heard that the new boss plans to \"shake things up\" in her department. The new boss just hired Emily, whose job seems to be the same as Rosa's. Tension on the job often comes from poor communication. Being unable to talk about your needs, concerns, and frustrations can create stress. A new job with more responsibility and better pay just opened up in Jill's department. And she's been with the company longer than anyone else on her team. But after several weeks, a coworker is promoted to the new job. Lack of support from your boss or coworkers makes it harder to solve other problems at work that are causing stress for you. His coworkers never make it out of their cubicles during the day, even to let off a little steam. Unpleasant or dangerous physical conditions, such as crowding, noise, or ergonomic problems, can cause stress. She wears earplugs, but at the end of her shift her ears are ringing. You can reduce some job stress by learning how to manage your time and your job duties. Think about the kinds of events that trigger stress for you at work. Then you can focus on one or two things you can do that will help the most to reduce stress. Here are some ideas: Meet with your manager at least once a year (every 3 or 6 months is even better) to talk about your job and your performance. If a performance review is already part of your job, treat it as a chance to clear up issues that may be causing stress for you. Here are some questions to ask: What is expected of me in this job?Where is this company going? How can I improve?What can I expect from you if there's a problem with my work or my job?If I continue to do well, how might my efforts to be recognized? Keep track of your projects and deadlines by making a list of what's urgent. Just seeing on paper that there is time to get each task done can help you get to work. Break a large project into small steps, and set a deadline for each one. But if you start to feel stressed, go back to doing one thing at a time. Ask others to give you a block of time when you are not disturbed. Don't let the technologies that help you do your work get in the way of your leisure time. For more information, see the topic Stop Negative Thoughts: Choosing a Healthier Way of Thinking. Enjoy a snack at your desk, or-if your job permits-take a short walk or visit with a coworker. If you spend every second of your day getting things done, you may resent never having time for yourself. If your employer offers a flexible work schedule, use it in a way that fits your work style. Go into work earlier and take a longer break at lunch to make time for a yoga class or a walk. For more information, see: Stress Management: Breathing Exercises for Relaxation.Stress Management: Doing Guided Imagery to Relax.Stress Management: Doing Progressive Muscle Relaxation. First, identify what's creating stress at work. Maybe it's lack of control over your job. Or maybe it's worry about losing your job or how you are doing at work. You might feel stress because you're unable to express your thoughts and ideas to your boss and coworkers. You might want to protect your heart and your health by reducing stress. Or maybe you simply want to enjoy your life more and not let work stress control how you feel. Next, set a goal for yourself that involves reducing your stress level. Here are a few examples: Shelly's long-term goal is to reduce stress by managing her frustration over things she can't control at work. Her short-term goal is to learn to do deep breathing and relaxation exercises when she gets stressed. She'll try it the next time her boss hands her a last-minute project. Jill's long-term goal is to reduce stress by speaking up at work and expressing her interests and ideas more effectively. Raoul's long-term goal is to reduce stress by having a better understanding of what's expected of him at work. John's long-term goal is to reduce stress by learning to say \"no\" to projects he doesn't have time to handle. His short-term goal is to get organized and prioritize the projects he has now. He is going to make a list of all of his work and then prioritize the tasks that are most important. to write down your goals, the possible barriers, and your ideas for getting past them. By thinking about these barriers now, you can plan ahead for how to deal with them if they happen. Most important, make sure you get support from friends and family in your efforts to reduce job stress. If your company has an employee assistance program, you might use it to talk with a counselor. If you are truly miserable because of a stressful job, it may be time to think about changing jobs. Make sure you know whether it is you or the job that's the problem. Before you quit, spend time thinking about other job options. Not having a job will probably also lead to stress. Getting another job before you quit is best, but sometimes that isn't possible.

Short-term, low-dose hormone therapy (HT) can reduce or stop hot flashes and other menopause symptoms. Use the lowest dose needed for the shortest possible time, and have regular checkups. This is because HT may increase the risk of problems in a small number of women. These problems include blood clots, stroke, heart disease, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and dementia. Risk varies based on when you start HT in menopause and how long you take it. Using HT for a short time in early menopause has less risk than when it is started later in menopause.1, 2 If you have a history of heart disease or breast cancer, avoid using estrogen for hot flashes.

In some individuals, Degos disease will be limited to the skin (benign cutaneous Degos disease); other individuals will also develop symptoms affecting other organ systems (systemic Degos disease). Systemic Degos disease is most frequently characterized by lesions in the small intestine, but other organs are also affected. The systemic form of Degos disease can cause life-threatening complications such as perforated bowels leading to inflammation of the abdominal cavity (peritonitis). It is important to note that some individuals only develop skin lesions (which are not associated with life-threatening complications) and do not go on to develop systemic Degos disease."], [271, "Malignant Appendical Tumor", "Pseudomyxoma peritonei is a rare malignant growth characterized by the progressive accumulation of mucus-secreting (mucinous) tumor cells within the abdomen and pelvis. The disorder develops after a small growth (polyp) located within the appendix bursts through the wall of the appendix, and spreads mucus-producing tumor cells throughout the surrounding surfaces (e.g., the membrane that lines the abdominal cavity [peritoneum])."], [272, "Male Sexual Problems", "A sexual problem, or sexual dysfunction, refers to a problem during any phase of the sexual response cycle that prevents the individual or couple from experiencing satisfaction from the sexual activity. While research suggests that sexual dysfunction is common (43% of women and 31% of men report some degree of difficulty), it is a topic that many people are hesitant to discuss. Fortunately, most cases of sexual dysfunction are treatable, so it is important to share your concerns with your partner and doctor. These conditions include diabetes, heart and vascular (blood vessel) disease, neurological disorders, hormonal imbalances, chronic diseases such as kidney or liver failure, and alcoholism and drug abuse. In addition, the side effects of certain medications, including some antidepressant drugs, can affect sexual desire and function. Psychological causes: These include work-related stress and anxiety, concern about sexual performance, marital or relationship problems, depression, feelings of guilt, and the effects of a past sexual trauma. Among those commonly affected are seniors, which may be related to a decline in health associated with aging. The most common sexual problems in men are ejaculation disorders, erectile dysfunction, and inhibited sexual desire. There are different types of ejaculation disorders, including: Premature ejaculation -- This refers to ejaculation that occurs before or very soon after penetration. Premature ejaculation, the most common form of sexual dysfunction in men, often is due to nervousness over how well he will perform during sex. In some cases, premature and inhibited ejaculation are caused by a lack of attraction for a partner, past traumatic events, and psychological factors, including a strict religious background that causes the person to view sex as sinful. Certain drugs, including some antidepressants, may affect ejaculation, as can nerve damage to the spinal cord or back. Retrograde ejaculation is common in males with diabetes who suffer from diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage). This is due to problems with the nerves in the bladder and the bladder neck that allow the ejaculate to flow backward and into the bladder. In addition, certain medications, particularly those used to treat mood disorders, may cause problems with ejaculation. Causes of erectile dysfunction include diseases affecting blood flow, such as atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries); nerve disorders; psychological factors, such as stress, depression, and performance anxiety (nervousness over his ability to sexually perform); and injury to the penis. Chronic illness, certain medications, and a condition called Peyronie's disease (scar tissue in the penis) can also cause erectile dysfunction. Inhibited desire, or loss of libido, refers to a decrease in desire for, or interest in sexual activity. To diagnose a man's sexual problem, the doctor likely will begin with a thorough history of symptoms. He or she may order other tests to rule out any medical problems that may be contributing to the dysfunction. The doctor may refer you to other doctors, including a urologist (a doctor specializing in the urinary tract and male reproductive system), an endocrinologist (a doctor specializing in hormonal issues), a neurologist (a doctor specializing in disorders of the nervous system), sex therapists, and other counselors. Several tests can be used to evaluate the causes and extent of male sexual problems. They include: Blood tests -- These tests may be done to evaluate hormone levels as well as to check for diabetes, high cholesterol and other risk factors. A blockage in a blood vessel supplying blood to the penis may be contributing to erectile dysfunction. Sensory testing -- Particularly useful in evaluating the effects of diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage), sensory testing measures the strength of nerve impulses in a particular area of the body. Treatment strategies may include the following: Medical treatment -- This involves treatment of any physical problem that may be contributing to a man's sexual dysfunction. Medications -- Medications, such as tadalafil (Cialis), sildenafil (Viagra) or vardenafil (Levitra), may help improve sexual function in men by increasing blood flow to the penis. The topical spray is applied to the penis and contains lidocaine, reducing sensitivity and allowing for more ejaculation control. Hormones -- Men with low levels of testosterone may benefit from hormone supplementation (testosterone replacement therapy). Psychological therapy -- Therapy with a trained counselor can help a person address feelings of anxiety, fear, or guilt that may have an impact on sexual function. Education and communication -- Education about sex and sexual behaviors and responses may help a man overcome his anxieties about sexual performance. While sexual problems cannot be prevented, dealing with the underlying causes of the dysfunction can help you better understand and cope with the problem when it occurs. If you consistently experience sexual function problems, see your doctor for evaluation and treatment."], [273, "Managing Eating Problems After a Stroke", "If you're recovering from a stroke, it's important to eat well to nourish your body. It gives you the energy you need to stay active, do rehabilitative therapy, and get back to your daily activities. But eating may not be as simple as it was before your stroke. Brain damage can make it harder to move your muscles, make you more sensitive to pain, and affect your appetite and moods. Here are some ways a stroke can affect normal eating, and what you can do: Trouble swallowing. You may choke, cough, or gag while you eat. Or find that liquid comes out of your nose when you try to swallow. It usually gets better over time, but a few tips can help: Stick to soft foods. Items like cooked cereal, mashed potatoes, soup, cottage cheese, and applesauce are all easier to eat. If you want to try tougher foods, cut them into small pieces or chop them in a blender to make them easier to chew. She can guide you through exercises to strengthen your tongue, lips, throat, and mouth muscles, which will help you swallow. If that doesn't help, your therapist may suggest neuromuscular electrical stimulation. She may also recommend prescription medications like muscle relaxers, which can open your throat and make swallowing easier. A stroke can make the muscles in your arms or hands weaker, which makes it hard to use forks, knives, and spoons. Try: Flatware with larger and thicker handles that are easier to hold. You can switch to knives with curved blades that let you cut food with one hand. They help you scoop the food against a wall on the plate while you eat with one hand. You can put one under your plate or bowl to keep it from sliding. You may need special tools to help you cook one-handed, such as easy-grip scissors, battery-powered peelers, and specially designed cutting boards. If you're depressed, you may not feel like eating. To work up a stronger appetite, try to: Choose foods with strong flavors. If you're truly not hungry, also try a liquid supplement for added energy and nutrients. Exercise lightly, such as walking, to ramp up your appetite. If they don't fit well, they can hurt your mouth and make you want to eat less. It can make you feel sad and anxious, steal your appetite, and give you trouble sleeping. Your doctor can prescribe an antidepressant, or you can see a therapist or counselor for talk therapy. You may feel too tired to get out of bed, let alone make it to the grocery store and fix a full meal. Buy pre-cut, pre-washed fruits and veggies. Ask friends and family members to make dishes that you can freeze and reheat on those days when you're too pooped to cook. Generally, you can take advantage of this nonprofit program if you're 60 and older. This way, your companion can make sure you're eating properly and give you any help you need."], [274, "Managing an Episode of Croup", "Here are four ways to make your baby more comfortable if she has croup. Croup causes your little one's airways to get inflamed and narrow. But the more she cries and the more worked-up she gets, the worse her symptoms will become. If you don't have a humidifier, run a hot shower in your bathroom. Once the air is nice and steamy, sit in the bathroom with your baby for 10 minutes. If it's cool outside, open a door or window for a few minutes. You might even take your baby for a car ride with the windows rolled down. It's important to keep your baby hydrated if she has croup. Warm, clear fluids can help loosen mucus and take pressure off her vocal cords. If she's very young or really cranky, give her small amounts of fluid using a spoon or medicine dropper. Prop up your little one's head with an extra pillow when she turns in at night. You might also consider sleeping in the same room with your child so you can know right away if she starts having breathing problems. If your child's symptoms last more than 3 to 5 days or get worse, don't try to treat her at home. Get medical help right away if your child: Makes a noisy, high-pitched sound when she breathes in (doctors call this \"stridor\") Starts drooling or has trouble swallowing Is constantly cranky, irritable, or uncomfortable Has very hard, labored breathing Has neck or chest muscles that \"pull in\" when she breathes Is very tired, sleepy, or hard to awaken Turns bluish or dark around her lips, under her nose, mouth, or around her fingernails Is dehydrated with few wet diapers"], [275, "Nursery Equipment Safety Checklist", "After you have read the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's The Safe Nursery: A Booklet to Help Avoid Injuries From Nursery Furniture and Equipment, use this checklist as your guide when buying new or secondhand nursery products, or when you evaluate the product now being used by your baby or young child.

Symptoms typically begin after age 60 but can begin earlier. PSP is often misdiagnosed as Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, or other neurodegenerative disorders."], [277, "NSAIDs", "NSAIDs -- or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs -- are among the most common pain relief medicines in the world. Every day more than 30 million Americans use them to soothe headaches, sprains, arthritis symptoms, and other daily discomforts, according to the American Gastroenterological Association. And as if that wasn't enough, in addition to dulling pain NSAIDs also lower fever and reduce swelling. And if they're so good in some ways, why do they also raise the risk of heart problems in some people? Nonetheless, with the benefits and risks of NSAIDs in the headlines frequently, WebMD turned to four experts for a rundown of what researchers do know. Our panel consisted of: Byron Cryer, MD, a spokesman for the American Gastroenterological Association and an associate professor of medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. Nieca Goldberg, MD, a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association and chief of Women's Cardiac Care at Lennox Hill Hospital in New York. John Klippel, MD, president and CEO of the Arthritis Foundation in Atlanta. Scott Zashin, MD, clinical assistant professor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and author of Arthritis Without Pain. Here is their explanation of how NSAIDs help ease your pain -- and sometimes cause side effects in the process. When you get injured -- say with a sprain -- the damaged tissue releases chemicals called prostaglandins, which are like hormones. They block the effects of special enzymes -- specifically Cox-1 and Cox-2 enzymes. By blocking the Cox enzymes, NSAIDs stop your body from making as many prostaglandins. Most NSAIDs block both Cox-1 and Cox-2 enzymes. They include the over-the-counter drugs: Aspirin (Bufferin, Bayer, and Excedrin) Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, Nuprin) Ketoprofen (Actron, Orudis) Naproxen (Aleve) Other NSAIDs are available by prescription. They include: Daypro Indocin Lodine Naprosyn Relafen Vimovo Voltaren Aspirin has some benefits that other NSAIDs do not. The biggest is that aspirin works against the formation of blood clots. As a result, you are less likely to form the clots that can cause heart attacks and strokes. Cox-2 inhibitors are a newer form of prescription NSAID. As you might guess, they only affect Cox-2 enzymes and not Cox-1. So while an NSAID may do a great job of easing your pain, it may also be having other effects -- some of them unwanted -- in other parts of your body. Gastrointestinal Problems The most common risk of standard NSAIDs is that they can cause ulcers and other problems in your esophagus, stomach, or small intestine. NSAIDs prevent the creation of prostaglandins, the hormone-like chemicals that cause swelling and increase pain. One type of prostaglandin helps protect the lining of the stomach and GI tract. And the Cox-1 enzyme helps make this prostaglandin. Since regular NSAIDs block Cox-1 enzymes, they slow down the manufacture of this prostaglandin. With its defenses down, your GI tract becomes irritated and damaged by normal gastric acids. NSAIDs reduce the blood flow to the kidneys, which makes them work more slowly. If you take NSAIDs in high doses, the reduced blood flow can permanently damage your kidneys. Allergic Reactions NSAIDs can also cause extreme allergic reactions, especially in people with asthma. Many specialists recommend that people who have asthma stay away from any NSAID, especially if they have sinus problems or nasal polyps. Cox-2 Inhibitors are a type of NSAID, and generally they work in similar ways. Cox-2 inhibitors were specifically designed to avoid the gastrointestinal problems common to other NSAIDs. Most NSAIDs affect levels of both Cox-1 and Cox-2 enzymes. Cox-2 inhibitors offer the same pain relief as standard NSAIDs, but a much lower risk of gastrointestinal problems. In a normal body, the levels of Cox-1 and Cox-2 enzymes are naturally in balance. Normally, these nasty effects are kept in check by another chemical called prostacyclin. But prostacyclin is made, in part, with the help of Cox-2 enzymes -- the enzymes that drugs like Celebrex block. Levels of prostacyclin go down, the influence of Cox-1 goes unchecked, and your risk of heart attacks and strokes goes up."], [278, "NSA", "Hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia is a term used to describe a group of rare, genetically transmitted blood disorders characterized by the premature destruction of red blood cells (erythrocytes or RBCs). Red blood cells depend on this process for energy and if an enzyme is defective in any one of the stages, the red blood cell cannot function properly and hemolysis, or the breakdown of the membrane that holds the cell together, takes place. The more common of the enzyme deficiencies that lead to HNSHA involve glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, pyruvate kinase deficiency and hexokinase deficiency. There may be as many as 16 red blood cell enzyme abnormalities that may cause hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia."], [279, "Nosebleed Stopping", "Most nosebleeds occur in the front of the nose and involve only one nostril. A less common but more serious type of nosebleed starts in the back of the nose and often involves both nostrils. This type of nosebleed may occur more frequently in older adults because of health conditions they may have. Follow these steps to stop a nosebleed: Sit up straight and tip your head slightly forward. This may cause blood to run down the back of your throat, and you may swallow it. Swallowed blood can irritate your stomach and cause vomiting. And vomiting may make the bleeding worse or cause it to start again. The nose consists of a hard, bony part and a softer part made of cartilage. Nosebleeds usually occur in the soft part of the nose. Spraying the nose with a medicated nasal spray (such as Afrin) before applying pressure may help stop a nosebleed. Apply an ice pack to your nose and cheeks. Cold will constrict the blood vessels and help stop the bleeding. Put a thin layer of a saline- or water-based nasal gel, such as NasoGel, or an antiseptic nasal cream inside your nose. After you have stopped a nosebleed, the following tips may prevent a nosebleed from happening again: Avoid forceful nose-blowing. Put a thin layer of a saline- or water-based nasal gel, such as NasoGel, or an antiseptic nasal cream inside your nose. Do not use aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen for 3 to 4 days. Acetaminophen, such as Tylenol, may be used to relieve pain. Do not use nonprescription antihistamines, decongestants, or medicated nasal sprays. Nosebleeds may develop in people who have colds or chronic hay fever symptoms (postnasal drip, sneezing, or a runny, stuffy, or itchy nose) because nasal tissues become inflamed and irritated. Using medicines may relieve the symptoms, leading to less inflammation and irritation and fewer nosebleeds. But overuse of allergy medicines may lead to nosebleeds because of their overdrying side effects. If you have a lot of nosebleeds, talk to your doctor about the proper use of cold and allergy medicines. If you are helping someone else stop a nosebleed, avoid touching the other person's blood. Use gloves, if available, or layers of fabric or a plastic bag to protect yourself."], [280, "North American Blastomycosis", "Blastomycosis is a rare infectious multisystem disease that is caused by the fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis. It is characterized by fever, chills, cough, and/or difficulty breathing (dyspnea). In the chronic phase of the disease, the lungs and skin are most frequently affected."], [281, "Noroviruses", "Noroviruses cause gastroenteritis, food infection, food poisoning, and acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis. Noroviruses typically spread through contaminated water and foods, although they can also pass from person to person. Water becomes contaminated if human waste enters drinking water because of flooding or from a sewage system that isn't working properly. You may become infected by: Eating foods or drinking liquids that are contaminated with norovirus. Shellfish and salad ingredients are the foods most often infected with the viruses. Food other than shellfish may be contaminated by food handlers. Touching surfaces or objects contaminated with norovirus, and then placing your hand in your mouth. For example, if you are a caregiver or share foods or utensils with someone who is ill, you may become infected. Persons working in day care centers or nursing homes should pay special attention to children or residents who have norovirus illnesses. A mild and brief illness usually develops 24 to 48 hours after you eat or drink the contaminated food or water and lasts for 24 to 60 hours. Only in rare cases does a person get very sick or have to go to the hospital. You can often diagnosis food poisoning yourself if others who ate the same food as you also become ill. If you do go to your doctor, he or she will make the diagnosis based on your symptoms, a medical history, and a physical exam. Your doctor will ask where you have been eating and whether anyone who ate the same foods has the same symptoms. Try to drink a cup of water or rehydration drink for each large, loose stool you have. Eating your usual diet will help you to get enough nutrition. Also avoid spicy foods, alcohol, and coffee for 2 days after all symptoms have disappeared. If you had diarrhea caused by norovirus, you should stay home for 2 to 3 days after your symptoms end before going back to work or school. You can help prevent infection by doing the following: Wash your hands often, especially after using the bathroom and before handling food. Wash fruits and vegetables and steam oysters before eating them. If you suspect that your drinking water is contaminated, boil water for 1 minute (3 minutes at elevations above 6,500 feet). Clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces immediately after vomiting or having diarrhea by using a bleach-based household cleaner. Immediately remove and wash soiled clothing or linens after vomiting or having diarrhea. Do not prepare food if you have symptoms of food poisoning and for 3 days after you recover."], [282, "Normal Menstrual Cycle", "The menstrual cycle is the series of changes a woman's body goes through to prepare for a pregnancy. About once a month, the uterus grows a new lining (endometrium) to get ready for a fertilized egg . When there is no fertilized egg to start a pregnancy, the uterus sheds its lining. This is the monthly menstrual bleeding (also called menstrual period) that women have from their early teen years until menopause, around age 50. The menstrual cycle is from Day 1 of bleeding to Day 1 of the next time of bleeding. Although the average cycle is 28 days, it is normal to have a cycle that is shorter or longer. Girls usually start having menstrual periods between the ages of 11 and 14. Women usually start to have fewer periods between ages 39 and 51. Women in their 40s and teens may have cycles that are longer or change a lot. If you are a teen, your cycles should even out with time. If you are nearing menopause, your cycles will probably get longer and then will stop. It's especially important to check with your doctor if you have three or more menstrual periods that last longer than 7 days or are very heavy. Also call if you have bleeding between your periods or pelvic pain that is not from your period. Progesterone increases after an ovary releases an egg (ovulation) at the middle of the cycle. This helps the estrogen keep the lining thick and ready for a fertilized egg. A drop in progesterone (along with estrogen) causes the lining to break down. For example, teens tend to have low or changing progesterone levels. This is also true for women close to menopause. That is why teens and women in their 40s may have heavy menstrual bleeding and cycles that change in length. For about a week before a period, many women have some premenstrual symptoms. You also may have less energy than usual. A day or two before your period, you may start having pain (cramps) in your belly, back, or legs. These symptoms go away during the first days of a period. When your ovary releases an egg in the middle of your cycle, you may have pain in your lower belly. You also might have red spotting for less than a day. You can use pads, tampons, or menstrual cups to manage bleeding. Many women can improve their symptoms by getting regular exercise and eating a healthy diet. A heating pad, hot water bottle, or warm bath also can help with cramps. You can take an over-the-counter medicine such as ibuprofen or naproxen before and during your period to reduce pain and bleeding. What controls the menstrual cycle?"], [283, "Nontraditional Medicine", "The word \"complementary\" means \"in addition to.\" Complementary medicine is a term used for a wide variety of health care practices that may be used along with standard medical treatment. For example: Acupuncture is standard in China but not in the United States. Hypnosis is a standard part of psychiatry, but it may not be standard if used to treat cancer. Examples of complementary medicine include: Alternative health approaches such as traditional Chinese medicine, homeopathy, and naturopathy. Mind and body practices like acupuncture, massage therapy, and tai chi. Natural products like herbs, dietary supplements, and probiotics. Some complementary practices have been studied and tested. We often don't have good evidence from science about whether they are safe, when they should be used, and how well they work. In the U.S., the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health was formed within the National Institutes of Health to test the safety and effectiveness of these treatments. The center has guidelines to help you choose safe treatments that are right for you. People often use complementary practices along with care from their medical doctor to deal with chronic health problems, treat symptoms, or stay healthy. Find out about the safety of any complementary product or practice you want to try. Most mind and body practices-such as acupuncture, meditation, and yoga-are very safe when used by healthy people with a well-trained professional. Talk with your doctor about any complementary health practice that you would like to try or are already using. Your doctor can help you manage your health better if he or she has the whole picture about your health. Some of these treatments may be covered by your health insurance. But check to see what your plan covers. The greatest risk is that you may use these treatments instead of going to your regular doctor. Complementary medicine should be in addition to treatment from your doctor. And they may also contain harmful things not listed on the label. Also, complementary medicine isn't controlled as much as standard medicine. This means you could become a victim of fraud. Sellers or people who practice complementary medicine are more likely to be frauds if they: Require large up-front payments. Warn you not to trust your doctor. One benefit is that many people who practice complementary medicine take a \"whole person,\" or holistic, approach to treatment. They may take an hour or more to ask you questions about your lifestyle, habits, and background. This makes many people feel better about the treatment, the person giving the treatment itself, and the condition. In some cases, this type of medicine works as well as standard medicine. Also, these treatments may cost less and have fewer side effects than standard treatment. And since most complementary medicine looks at the connection between mind and body, many people who use it feel better. What is the difference between complementary medicine, alternative medicine, and integrative medicine?"], [284, "Nonthrombocytopenic Idiopathic Purpura", "Henoch-Schonlein purpura is a rare inflammatory disease of the small blood vessels (capillaries) and is usually a self-limited disease. The symptoms of Henoch-Schonlein purpura usually begin suddenly and may include headache, fever, loss of appetite, cramping abdominal pain, and joint pain. Inflammatory changes associated with Henoch-Schonlein purpura can also develop in the joints, kidneys, digestive system, and, in rare cases, the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). In one form of the disorder, termed Schonlein's purpura, the skin and joints are affected but the gastrointestinal tract is not. The exact cause of Henoh-Schonlein purpura is not fully understood, although research suggests that it may be an autoimmune disease or, in some rare cases, an extreme allergic reaction to certain offending substances (e.g., foods or drugs)."], [285, "Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer", "There are things you can do to help you feel better, too. People who smoke or who breathe a lot of smoke are most likely to get NSCLC. Adenocarcinomastarts in cells in your air sacs that make mucus and other substances, often in the outer parts of your lungs. It's the most common kind of lung cancer among both smokers and nonsmokers and people under 45. It often grows more slowly than other lung cancers. Squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma starts in cells that line the inner airways of the lungs. The treatments your doctor suggests will depend on how far your lung cancer has spread. Other things that make lung cancer more likely are: Radon, a radioactive gas found naturally in soil and rocks Asbestos Mineral and metal dust Air pollution Radiation treatment to your chest or breast HIV/AIDS It can also run in families. You may not notice symptoms in the early stages. Or you might mistake them for another illness, such as pneumonia or a collapsed lung. Like other types of lung cancer, symptoms can include: Coughing that lasts or gets worse Chest pain that often hurts more when you cough, laugh, or take deep breaths Hoarseness or voice changes Harsh, raspy sounds when you breathe Wheezing Weight loss, little appetite Coughing up blood or mucus Shortness of breath Feeling weak or tired Lasting lung problems, like bronchitis or pneumonia If the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, you may have: Bone pain Headache Dizziness or balance problems Numbness or weakness in an arm or leg Yellow skin or eyes First, your doctor will talk with you and ask questions like: When did you first notice problems? Does anything make your symptoms better or worse? Has anyone in your family had lung cancer? CT scans are powerful X-rays that make detailed pictures of the tissue and the blood vessels in the lung. Sputum cytology is a lab test that checks the mucus you cough up for cancer cells. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy takes cells from an abnormal growth or the fluid in your lungs. Your doctor may want to look inside your lungs and chest using a thin, flexible tube with a light and tiny camera. He may also take samples of tissue, including from nearby lymph nodes, to check for cancer cells. He can do this a few different ways: Bronchoscopy goes through your nose or mouth and into your lungs. Endobronchial ultrasounduses bronchoscopy with an ultrasound placed at the tip of the tube to look at lymph nodes and other structures. Endoscopic ultrasound is like the endobronchial ultrasound, but your doctor puts the endoscope down your throat into the esophagus. Thoracoscopy uses a few small cuts along your side to look at the outside of your lung and the tissue around it. Mediastinoscopy makes a small cut just above your breastbone, in the space between your lungs. That will help your medical team figure out the best treatment for you. Cancer cells are in lung fluid or sputum, but the doctor can't find where the cancer is in your lungs. Stage 0: Cancer cells are in the lining of your airways. Stage II: A larger tumor is in one lung, or the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes. Stage III: Cancer in one lung has spread to farther lymph nodes or into nearby structures. Stage IV: Cancer has spread to both lungs, to fluid around the lungs, or to other parts of the body, such as the brain and liver. You may want to start by asking your doctor: How serious is my lung cancer? Have you treated anyone else with this type of lung cancer? Is there a medical center that takes care of my kind of cancer regularly that I could go to? Ask a friend or family member to go with you to your appointments for emotional support and to help you understand what the doctor tells you. You may feel more comfortable getting a second opinion before deciding on your treatment plan. Doctors treat this kind of lung cancer in two ways: They target the cancer itself, and they try to make you feel better. Their goal is to stay ahead of the symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible. Your doctor may suggest a combination of treatments, depending on what kind of cancer you have and where it is. If you're in an early stage, your doctor will probably recommend surgery to take out the cancer. Other types of surgery destroy cancer cells by freezing them or using a heated probe or needle. It also treats certain cancers that your doctor can't get rid of with surgery. The radiation comes either from a high-energy beam aimed at the cancer from outside of your body using a special machine, or from a radioactive substance put inside your body in or near the cancer. Whether you get it as pills or with a needle in a vein or muscle, the drugs travel throughout your body to kill the cancer. Your doctor might put it in your spinal fluid, a specific organ, or a space inside your body to target cancer cells in that area. You could get chemo before surgery to make a tumor smaller, after surgery, or both, or even if you don't have surgery. Check the National Cancer Institute's web site and ask your doctor if a clinical trial would be a good fit for you, what you should consider, and how to sign up. Let your doctor know if you have any pain or shortness of breath. As you follow your treatment plan, pay attention to any changes you feel. Tell your doctor how you're doing, both physically and emotionally. But you'll need to eat well to keep your strength and energy up. If you have trouble breathing, oxygen from a tank may help. So can practicing relaxation techniques, like meditation, listening to music, or picturing yourself in a peaceful place. Complementary treatments, including gentle massage and aromatherapy, may put you more at ease. Talk to your doctor about what you can do when you're tired, in pain, or breathless. A support group or a counselor who works with people who have cancer could help you work through your feelings. Look online or in your community, or ask your doctor for suggestions and about other professionals who can help support you -- perhaps social workers, nurses, clergy, or other doctors. If it's caught early enough, your cancer may be curable. Even if it's not, your treatment should help you live longer and feel better.

According to the Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Registry, approximately 79 percent of pediatric cardiomyopathy cases occur for unknown reasons (idiopathic)."], [289, "Macular Degeneration Age-Related Macular Degeneration Overview", "Macular degeneration is the leading cause of severe, irreversible vision loss in people over age 60. Because the disease develops as a person ages, it is often referred to as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). There are two main types of age-related macular degeneration: Dry form. The \"dry\" form of macular degeneration is characterized by the presence of yellow deposits, called drusen, in the macula. A few small drusen may not cause changes in vision; however, as they grow in size and increase in number, they may lead to a dimming or distortion of vision that people find most noticeable when they read. In more advanced stages of dry macular degeneration, there is also a thinning of the light-sensitive layer of cells in the macula leading to atrophy, or tissue death. In the atrophic form of dry macular degeneration, patients may have blind spots in the center of their vision. These blood vessels leak blood and fluid into the retina, causing distortion of vision that makes straight lines look wavy, as well as blind spots and loss of central vision. These abnormal blood vessels and their bleeding eventually form a scar, leading to permanent loss of central vision. Most patients with macular degeneration have the dry form of the disease and can lose some form of central vision. However, the dry form of macular degeneration can lead to the wet form. Although only about 10% of people with macular degeneration develop the wet form, they make up the majority of those who experience serious vision loss from the disease. It is very important for people with macular degeneration to monitor their eyesight carefully and see their eye doctor on a regular basis. In fact, it is the leading cause of severe vision loss in adults over age 60. If someone in your family has or had the condition you may be at higher risk for developing macular degeneration. Smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, and being light skinned, female, and having a light eye color are also risk factors for macular degeneration. The first sign of macular degeneration is usually blurred vision with a dim, blurry spot in the middle of your vision. Symptoms of macular degeneration include: Dark, blurry areas in the center of vision Diminished or changed color perception If you experience any of these symptoms, see an eye specialist as soon as possible. Age-related macular degeneration can be detected in a routine eye exam. Some of the straight lines may appear wavy to you, or you may notice that some of the lines are missing. If there are new vessels or vessels leaking fluid or blood in the macula, the photographs will show their exact location and type. Early detection of age-related macular degeneration is very important because there are treatments that can delay or reduce the severity of the disease. There is currently no cure for macular degeneration, but treatments may prevent severe vision loss or slow the progression of the disease considerably. These medications (Avastin, Eyelea, Lucentis, Macugen) block the development of new blood vessels and leakage from the abnormal vessels within the eye that cause wet macular degeneration. This treatment has been a major change in the treatment of this condition and many patients have actually regained vision that was lost. A large study performed by the National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health, called AREDS (Age-Related Eye Disease Study), showed that for certain individuals, vitamins C, E, beta-carotene, zinc and copper can decrease the risk of vision loss in patients with intermediate to advanced dry macular degeneration. However, the ingredients of vision supplements may change with the completion of the AREDS2 study. This study sought to see if adding other vitamins and mineral to the supplement would improve results of the AREDS. The first addition was omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil), and the second was a combination of two carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin, which are found in leafy green vegetables and highly colored fruits and vegetables. The research showed: Beta-carotene did not reduce the risk of progression of AMD. People that took a formula with lutein and zeaxanthin and who may not have been taking enough in their diet showed further improve with the new AREDS formula. High-energy laser light can sometimes be used to destroy actively growing abnormal blood vessels that occur in macular degeneration. A two-step treatment in which a light-sensitive drug (Visudyne) is used to damage the abnormal blood vessels. A doctor injects the drug into the bloodstream to be absorbed by the abnormal blood vessels in the eye. They help people who have vision loss from macular degeneration make the most of their remaining vision. A surgical procedure used to destroy abnormal blood vessels that are located directly under the center of the macula, where a laser beam cannot be placed safely. The wet form of macular degeneration is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss. When both eyes are affected, you may experience a significant decrease in your quality of life. The dry form of age-related macular degeneration is much more common and tends to progress more slowly, allowing you to keep most of your vision. Unfortunately, even after wet macular degeneration treatment, the condition can recur and require repeated treatments. Because of this, individuals with macular degeneration must test their own vision regularly and follow the recommendations of their ophthalmologist."], [290, "Nonketotic Hypoglycemia and Carnitine De...", "Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is a rare genetic metabolic disorder characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Abnormally low levels of the MCAD enzyme may also hamper or interrupt other processes associated with the metabolism of fatty acids. In infants with MCAD deficiency, symptoms may include recurrent episodes of unusually low levels of a certain sugar (glucose) in the blood (hypoglycemia), lack of energy (lethargy), vomiting, and/or liver malfunction. In some cases, a viral illness (e.g., upper respiratory infection) that limits food intake may cause the symptoms to occur. MCAD deficiency is the most common disease in a group of disorders that involve abnormalities of fatty acid metabolism (fatty acid oxidation disorders [FODs])."], [291, "Nonketotic Hyperglycinemia", "Nonketotic hyperglycinemia is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by the accumulation of large amounts of the amino acid glycine in blood, urine and, particularly, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

This condition is characterized by destructive changes in the blood vessels of the retina, which, if left unchecked, may lead to visual impairment or blindness. For reasons that are not well understood, the blood vessels of the retina lack their normal oxygen load. The diabetes process also weakens the walls of these blood vessels, which tend to become enlarged and form micro-aneurysms."], [293, "Noninfectious Uveitis", "Uveitis, also known as iritis, means you have inflammation -- heat, redness, pain, and swelling -- in one or both of your eyes. It can cause vision loss, but it's easily treated. See your eye doctor as soon as you notice a problem. If you get treatment early, you can ease your symptoms and protect your vision. Uveitis gets its name from the uvea, the middle layer of your eye. The inflammation can also affect other parts of your eye, like the lens or retina. Adults between 20 and 60 years old are most likely to get it. How it affects you depends a lot on the cause and how quickly you get treated. You might only have minor problems with your sight. You might have it for a short time or for many years. Left alone, it can turn into serious eyesight troubles, like glaucoma or cataracts. Noninfectious uveitis can result from an eye injury or a disease somewhere else in your body. The uvea has a lot of blood vessels, so if your immune system is fighting off a problem in one area, the cells and chemicals it makes can travel through your bloodstream and enter your eye. If you have one of these conditions, you're more likely to get uveitis: AIDS Behcet's syndrome Shingles Multiple sclerosis Psoratic arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis Sarcoidosis Tuberculosis Ulcerative colitis Crohn's disease In some cases, doctors don't know what causes noninfectious uveitis. If you notice any of these, see an eye doctor right away: Change in vision Dark floating spots (floaters) Eye pain Eye redness Light sensitivity Swelling You'll need to see an eye doctor called an ophthalmologist. She'll give you an eye exam and ask you questions about your symptoms, like: Have you had any pain? During eye exam, the doctor will: Test your vision to see if your eyesight has changed Measure the pressure in your eye Widen, or dilate, your pupils so she can look at the back of your eye Use a microscope and a thin beam of light to check different parts of your eye. She may also do blood tests, X-rays, or other lab tests to check for medical conditions that might be linked to uveitis. It's important to treat uveitis right away so it doesn't permanently scar your eye or lead to other serious problems, like glaucoma or cataracts. Your doctor may give you steroid eye drops to ease the swelling, redness, and pain. Doctors can treat some types of the condition with a small capsule that slowly releases steroids inside your eye. Many of these cases are in just one eye. But with this treatment, you can be more likely to get cataracts or glaucoma. The surgery to put the capsule in your eye won't require a hospital stay. If your doctor recommends this option, ask her what you can expect. If you take oral steroids for a long time, you may have side effects, like cataracts, stomach ulcers, bone thinning (your doctor will call this osteoporosis), diabetes, and weight gain. Your doctor will refer to them as immunosuppressants. Or you could get drugs to boost your body's own response to inflammation. They don't get prescribed often, but your doctor may choose them if steroids haven't helped you. If you take them, you'll get regular blood tests and doctor's appointments to make sure they aren't causing any side effects. Treatment will help ease any eye pain and swelling you may have, but keep your doctor informed about any discomfort or changes in your vision. If your uveitis was caused by another medical condition, you'll need to make sure you get the right treatment for it as well. It all depends on what the root cause is and how quickly you get treatment. You may have one bout of uveitis, or it may come back again and again. Whatever the case, medicines can help ease pain, restore vision, and stop damage to your eye."], [294, "Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma", "The lymphatic system is a network of nodes (knots of tissue) connected by vessels. Lymphocytes, are a type of white blood cell that helps fight infections caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. When the lymphatic system is fighting an active infection, you may notice that some of the lymph nodes in the area of the infection become swollen and tender. Lymphoma occurs when the lymph-node cells or the lymphocytes begin to multiply uncontrollably, producing cancerous cells that have the abnormal capacity to invade other tissues throughout the body. The differences in these two types of lymphoma are certain unique characteristics of the different lymphoma cells. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is further classified into a variety of subtypes based on the cell of origin (B-cell or T-cell), and the cell characteristics. The subtype of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma predicts the necessity of early treatment, the response to treatment, the type of treatment required, and the prognosis. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is the seventh most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. The risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma increases with age and it is more common in males than in females and in Caucasians. However, there are multiple medical conditions that are associated with an increased risk of developing the disease: Inherited immune deficiencies Genetic syndromes: Down syndrome, Klinefelter's syndrome (a genetic condition in men caused by an extra X chromosome) Immune disorders, and their treatments: Sjogren's syndrome (an immune disorder characterized by unusual dryness of mucus membranes), rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus Celiac disease, a disease involving the processing of certain components of gluten, a protein in grains Inflammatory bowel disease, particularly Crohn's disease, and its treatment Psoriasis Family history of lymphoma Bacteria: Helicobacter pylori, associated with gastritis and gastric ulcers; Borrelia burgdorferi, associated with Lyme disease; Campylobacter jejuni; Chalmydia psittaci Viruses: HIV, HTLV-1, SV-40, HHV-8, Epstein Barr virus, hepatitis virus Non-random chromosomal translocations and molecular rearrangements Regular exposure to certain chemicals, including insect and weed killers, and a number of chemicals used in industries such as farming, welding, and lumber Exposure to nuclear accidents, nuclear testing, or underground radiation leaks Treatment with immunosuppressant drugs, for prevention of organ transplantation rejection, or for treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders Tumor necrosis factor agents used to treat psoriatic and rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease Prior exposure to chemotherapy and/or radiation used to treat a prior diagnosis of cancer Treatment with a medication called Dilantin (phenytoin), commonly used to treat seizure disorders Use of hair dyes, especially dark and permanent colors, used before 1980 (research is inconclusive) High levels of nitrates found in drinking water Diets high in fat and meat products Ultraviolet light exposure Alcohol intake"], [295, "Nose Fracture", "When you've taken a blow to the nose and it's swollen and bleeding, you may wonder whether or not it's broken. A broken nose (also called a nasal fracture) is the most common type of face injury. These are common symptoms of a nasal fracture: A swollen, bent, or crooked nose Pain, especially when you touch your nose Nosebleed Black eyes or bruises beneath your eyes Trouble breathing through your nose (as though your nostrils are stuffy or blocked) Mucus running out of your nose A \"cracking\" sound when you touch your nose Right after you've gotten hurt, you'll need to stop any bleeding and try to reduce pain and swelling. You'll need to stop any bleeding and try to reduce pain and swelling. Do these things until you can get to a doctor: Stop the Bleeding Sit up - don't lie down or lean back. Your nose needs to stay higher than your heart. Pinch the soft part of your nose with your thumb and index finger, and hold it tightly for 5 minutes. If the bleeding hasn't stopped, pinch your nose again for 10 more minutes. Ease the Pain Take over-the-counter pain medicine (like acetaminophen or ibuprofen) as needed. Don't put pressure on the ice pack - you may hurt your nose. Put ice on your nose at least four times per day for the first 2 days after you get hurt. If you only have swelling and moderate pain, you may choose to wait to see your doctor. Your symptoms could improve, and you might get better on your own. But see your doctor if 3 to 5 days have passed and you notice any of the following: The pain and swelling aren't getting better. You have a hard time breathing, even after the swelling improves. Get emergency help if you have any of these things in addition to nose pain: A severe headache, neck pain, vomiting, or passing out Hard time breathing Bleeding that won't stop Clear, watery fluid draining from your nose If your doctor confirms that your nose is broken, he'll likely wait for the swelling to go down before deciding whether or not it needs to be fixed. If it does, he'll choose to fix it either with surgery or without. If your doctor decides your nose can be fixed without surgery, he'll have to do it within 1 to 2 weeks of your accident. If he waits any longer, the injury will begin to heal on its own, even if the bones are out of place. Then, he'll open your nostrils with a flat tool called a speculum. He'll use special instrument to put your broken bones and cartilage back in place. Your doctor probably will choose this option if your nasal fracture is severe or has gone untreated for more than two weeks. The goal is to put your bones back in their proper place and reshape your nose, if necessary. You might also have to have nasal surgery to fix any breathing problems.

The mesentery is a fold of tissue of the peritoneum that supports and attaches the intestines to the wall of the abdomen. The symptoms of sclerosing mesenteritis can vary greatly from one person to another and can include a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, bloating, loss of appetite and diarrhea or constipation. Non-gastrointestinal symptoms include fatigue, weight loss, night sweats and fever. Introduction Sclerosing mesenteritis was first described in the medical literature in 1924 as retractile mesenteritis. Three prominent names that have been used in the literature are retractile mesenteritis, mesenteric panniculitis, and mesenteric lipodystrohpy. Sclerosing mesenteritis or retractile mesenteritis refers to a predominance of fibrosis; mesenteric panniculitis refers to a predominance of inflammation; and mesenteric lipodystrophy refers to a predominance fat necrosis. Because of the presence of some degree of fibrosis, many physicians advocate sclerosing mesenteritis as the best name for this spectrum of disease."], [298, "Nocturnal Enuresis", "Bed-wetting, or nocturnal enuresis, occurs when a child urinates in his sleep. About 5 to 7 million children over age 6 regularly wet their bed. While a small number of bed-wetting cases are due to medical conditions, such as a kidney infection or other urological problems, bed-wetting is most often a developmental issue. This ability normally occurs around age 5, when bed-wetting will stop on its own for 90% of kids, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Children who continue to wet the bed beyond age 6 may not be producing enough ADH hormone at appropriate times, or may not yet be attuned to their bodies' signals, or both. Although immaturity of the bladder or other medical conditions are more common, the possibility of sleep apnea must be considered when a child is being evaluated for bed-wetting problems. Parents should consider treatment for bed-wetting if their child is still wetting the bed between ages 6 and 7, according to the National Enuresis Society -- or sooner if the child seems troubled by bed-wetting.

Symptoms of NES include the following and often persist for at least two months: Little or no appetite for breakfast Eating more food after dinner than during the meal Eating more than half of daily food intake after dinner hour Recurrent awakenings from sleep that require eating to fall back asleep NS-RED and NES differ, in that people with NES eat when they are conscious. However, the disorders are similar in that they both are hybrids of sleep and eating disorders. Both of these conditions can interfere with an individual's nutrition, cause shame, and result in depression and weight gain. The number of people affected by these disorders increases up to 17% in those with other eating disorders. Many of these individuals diet during the day, which may leave them hungry and vulnerable to binge eating at night, when their control is weakened by sleep. In some cases, people with sleep-related eating disorders have histories of alcoholism, drug abuse, and other sleep disorders. Treatment of sleep-related eating disorders begins with an interview and may include an overnight stay in a sleep lab, where brain activity is monitored during the night. Medication sometimes can be helpful for these disorders; however, sleeping pills should be avoided, because they can increase confusion and clumsiness that can lead to injury.

Schwannomatosis has recently been identified as a third and more rare type of neurofibromatosis, but little is known about it. NF1, also called von Recklinghausen NF or peripheral NF, is characterized by multiple cafe au lait spots (patches of tan or light brown skin) and neurofibromas (soft, fleshy growths) on or under the skin. Enlargement and deformation of bones and curvature of the spine (scoliosis) may also occur. NF2, also called bilateral acoustic NF (BAN), is much less common than NF1 and is characterized by multiple tumors on the cranial and spinal nerves. Tumors that affect both of the auditory nerves and hearing loss beginning in the teens or early twenties are generally the first symptom of NF2. Neurofibromatosis is often inherited (passed on by family members through our genes), but about 50% of people newly diagnosed with the disorder have no family history of the condition, which can arise spontaneously through a mutation (change) in the genes. The following symptoms appear in people with NF1: Several (usually 6 or more) cafe au lait spots Multiple freckles in the armpit or groin area Tiny growths in the iris (colored area) of the eye; these are called Lisch nodules and usually do not affect eyesight. Neurofibromas that occur on or under the skin, sometimes even deep within the body; these are benign (harmless) tumors; however, in rare cases, they can turn malignant or cancerous.

This is because people with diabetes tend to have other long-standing medical conditions, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and blood vessel disease (atherosclerosis). In type 1 diabetes, kidney disease rarely begins in the first 10 years after diagnosis of diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, some patients already have kidney disease by the time they are diagnosed with diabetes. As the kidney function worsens, symptoms may include: Swelling of the hands, feet, and face Trouble sleeping or concentrating Poor appetite Nausea Weakness Itching (end-stage kidney disease) and extremely dry skin Drowsiness (end-stage kidney disease) Abnormalities in the hearts' regular rhythm, because of increased potassium in the blood Muscle twitching As kidney damage progresses, your kidneys cannot remove the waste from your blood. The waste then builds up in your body and can reach poisonous levels, a condition known as uremia. Certain blood tests that look for specific blood chemistry can be used to diagnose kidney damage. Lowering blood pressure and maintaining blood sugar control are absolutely necessary to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Some medicines called angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can help slow down the progression of kidney damage. Although ACE inhibitors -- including ramipril (Altace), quinapril (Accupril) , and lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril) -- are usually used to treat high blood pressure and other medical problems, they are often given to people with diabetes to prevent complications, even if their blood pressure is normal.

Potassium is found primarily in the skeletal muscle and bone, and participates with sodium to contribute to the normal flow of body fluids between the cells in the body. When the kidneys are functioning normally, the amount of potassium in the diet is sufficient for use by the body and the excess is usually excreted through urine and sweat. Secretion of the hormone insulin, which is normally stimulated by food, prevents a temporary diet-induced Hypokalemia by increasing cell absorption of potassium. When Hypokalemia occurs, there is an imbalance resulting from a dysfunction in this normal process, or the rapid loss of urine or sweat without replacement of sufficient potassium."], [308, "Nephritis and Nerve Deafness Hereditary", "Summary Alport syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive kidney disease and abnormalities of the ears and eyes. X-linked Alport syndrome (XLAS) is the most common; in these families affected males typically have more severe disease than affected females. In autosomal recessive Alport syndrome (ARAS) the severity of disease in affected males and females is similar. The hallmark of the disease is the appearance of blood in the urine (hematuria) early in life, with progressive decline in kidney function (kidney insufficiency) that ultimately results in kidney failure, especially in affected males. About 50% of untreated males with XLAS develop kidney failure by age 25, increasing to 90% by age 40 and nearly 100% by age 60. Both males and females with ARAS develop kidney failure, often in the teen-age years or early adulthood. Individuals with Alport syndrome can also develop progressive hearing loss of varying severity and abnormalities of the eyes that usually do not result in impaired vision. Alport syndrome is treated symptomatically and certain medications can potentially delay the progression of kidney disease and the onset of kidney failure. In 1927 Dr. Cecil Alport published a paper describing the association of kidney disease and deafness in affected individuals. Alport syndrome is often discussed with a related disorder known as thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN). Many cases of TBMN are caused by different mutations in the same genes that cause the autosomal recessive and dominant forms of Alport syndrome. TBMN is characterized by persistent microscopic blood in the urine (hematuria) in a similar pattern as seen in individuals with Alport syndrome. However, unlike Alport syndrome, TBMN is rarely associated with symptoms outside of the kidney (extrarenal abnormalities) and additional kidney findings such as protein in the urine (proteinuria), high blood pressure (hypertension), kidney insufficiency, and kidney failure rarely develop.

Pulmonary nocardiosis is the most common, and its symptoms are a lot like ones you might have with pneumonia or tuberculosis: Chest pain Coughing Sweating Chills Feeling weak Lack of appetite Unexplained weight loss Shortness of breath or a hard time breathing The most common signs of primary cutaneous nocardiosis are skin abscesses on your hands, chest, or rear end. These are bumps on or below the skin's surface that are usually filled with a fluid (pus). Signs that the infection has spread to your brain include: Bad headaches Motor skills problem, like balance or hand-eye coordination Extreme sensitivity to loud sounds or bright lights If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor right away. It can be hard to tell the difference between pulmonary nocardiosis and pneumonia or tuberculosis. And primary cutaneous nocardiosis looks a lot like several other, more common skin infections. To find out for sure, your doctor probably will take a small sample of tissue or fluid from the area where you're infected. If the infection is in your lungs, you might get a chest X-ray -- or a CT scan, which takes X-rays from several angles and puts them together to make a more detailed image. Nocardiosis usually can be cured with antibiotics, but not all of them will work against the bacteria. Then you might need to take them for 6 weeks up to a year, depending on how serious your infection is. In some cases, you might need surgery to remove or drain abscesses in infected areas."], [315, "Needle Aspiration Biopsy", "Fine needle aspiration is a type of biopsy procedure. In fine needle aspiration, a thin needle is inserted into an area of abnormal-appearing tissue or body fluid. As with other types of biopsies, the sample collected during fine needle aspiration can help make a diagnosis or rule out conditions such as cancer. Fine needle aspiration is generally considered a safe procedure. A fine needle aspiration is most often done on swellings or lumps located just under the skin. Or it may be discovered on an imaging test such as: CT scan mammogram ultrasound Imaging tests may also discover abnormal spots deeper inside the body. Doctors may recommend fine needle aspiration for areas such as: cysts (fluid-filled lumps) nodules or masses (solid lumps) enlarged lymph nodes Without a biopsy, it's usually hard for a doctor to confirm what these abnormal areas contain. The most common reason to get a fine needle aspiration is to test for cancer. Most fine needle aspirations are done on these areas: breast thyroid gland lymph nodes in the neck, groin, or armpit Those types of fine needle aspirations are performed through the skin. During an endoscopy, a doctor can do a fine needle aspiration on certain abnormal spots in the chest or abdomen. These include Plavix (clopidogrel) or brand-name versions of the generic drug warfarin. Most fine needle aspirations are outpatient procedures. For people undergoing fine needle aspiration through the skin, here's what to expect: Your skin over the area of the procedure will be cleaned with antiseptic solution. This will help locate the right area for fine needle aspiration. A thin needle attached to a syringe will be inserted through the skin into the abnormal area. A vacuum inside the syringe causes body fluid or tissue to be suctioned (aspirated) into the needle and syringe. The fine needle aspiration itself is usually a short procedure (less than 10 minutes). This will let your doctor: Verify that a good sample was obtained Make a rapid diagnosis Or, the biopsy sample may be sent to a lab for further testing. Endoscopic procedures usually take longer than fine needle aspirations through the skin (typically up to an hour). If sedating medication is used during fine needle aspiration, you may be groggy and unable to work afterward. At the biopsy site, you may have some: swelling soreness pain In most people, over-the-counter pain medicines are enough to decrease discomfort. It is also sold under these brand names: Actamin Panadol Tylenol Final results of testing after a fine needle aspiration can take up to a week or longer. Serious complications after fine needle aspiration are rare. Infection at the biopsy site is rare, because sterile techniques and equipment are used for all fine needle aspirations."], [316, "Necrotizing Lymphadenitis", "Kikuchi's disease, also known as histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenopathy, is a rare, benign, (noncancerous, nonmalignant) disorder of the lymph nodes of young adults, predominantly of young women. This disorder is often mistaken for malignant lymphoma, especially cervical adenopathy because the symptoms are very similar. The lesions, or tissue anomalies, of this disorder cause the lymph nodes to become enlarged (lymphadenopathy), inflamed and painful."], [317, "Necrotizing Fasciitis (Flesh-Eating Bact...)", "It can destroy skin, fat, and the tissue covering the muscles within a very short time. About 1 out of 4 people who get this infection die from it.1 Many people who get necrotizing fasciitis are in good health before they get the infection. Your risk of getting this infection is higher if you: Have a weak immune system. Have chronic health problems such as diabetes, cancer, or liver or kidney disease. Recently had chickenpox or other viral infections that cause a rash. Use steroid medicines, which can lower the body's resistance to infection. Some of these bacteria also cause infections such as strep throat and impetigo. But in rare cases they can cause a more dangerous infection. You can get necrotizing fasciitis when bacteria enter a wound, such as from an insect bite, a burn, or a cut. You can also get it in: Wounds that come in contact with ocean water, raw saltwater fish, or raw oysters, including injuries from handling sea animals such as crabs. An intestinal surgery site, or in tumors or gunshot injuries in the intestines. A muscle strain or bruise, even if there is no break in the skin. The bacteria that cause necrotizing fasciitis can be passed from person to person through close contact, such as touching the wound of the infected person. But this rarely happens unless the person who is exposed to the bacteria has an open wound, chickenpox, or an impaired immune system. You may need medical care right away if you have pain that gets better over 24 to 36 hours and then suddenly gets worse. The pain may be much worse than you would expect from the size of the wound or injury. You may also have: Skin that is red, swollen, and hot to the touch. You may go into shock and have damage to skin, fat, and the tissue covering the muscles. You also may need X-rays, a CT scan, or an MRI to look for injury to your organs or to find out how much the infection has spread. The sooner treatment begins, the more likely you will recover from the infection and avoid serious complications, such as limb amputation or death. You may be treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) at the hospital. Treatment may include: Surgery that removes infected tissue and fluids to stop the spread of infection. Removing limbs (amputation) or organs may be done to save the person's life, depending on how severe the infection is and where it has spread. Procedures to treat complications such as shock, breathing problems, and organ failure. Bacteria that cause the disease usually don't cause infection unless they enter the body through a cut or other break in the skin. If you have been in close contact with someone who has necrotizing fasciitis, your doctor may give you an antibiotic to help reduce your chances of getting the infection. If you notice any symptoms of infection (such as pain, swelling, redness, or fever) after you've been in close contact with someone who has necrotizing fasciitis, see your doctor right away."], [318, "Necrotizing Enterocolitis", "Necrotizing enterocolitis is infection and inflammation of the intestine. But if the infection becomes severe, it can cause severe damage to the intestine, which can be deadly. It may occur when the immune and digestive systems do not form in the right ways. Experts don't know if feeding formula to a newborn can lead to necrotizing enterocolitis. They do know that the disease is much less common in babies who are fed breast milk. Some doctors recommend probiotics to help prevent necrotizing enterocolitis in some infants who are at risk for it. Probiotics are bacteria that help maintain the natural balance of organisms (microflora) in the intestines. They may include: A swollen, tender, red, or shiny belly. Dark, black, or bloody stools. A test to check for blood in your baby's stool (fecal occult blood test). Tests to check for bacteria in the stool, blood, urine, or spinal fluid. Your baby will be treated in a hospital neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Treatment usually lasts 3 to 10 days. It may last longer if the condition is severe. Treatment includes intravenous (IV) feeding, antibiotics, and a tube that goes in the nose to the stomach to remove extra fluids and gas from the intestine. If your baby does not get better with treatment or gets a hole in the intestine, he or she may need surgery. The first surgery removes damaged parts of the intestine and may create a colostomy or ileostomy so that the intestine can heal. (With an ostomy, stool leaves the body through an opening in the belly and collects in a bag.) A second surgery will be done to close the ostomy so that stool can pass through the body normally again. After treatment, your baby will be ready to leave the hospital when he or she is eating well and is not losing weight. It can be stressful to watch a tiny newborn get medical treatment.

Causes of neck pain include: Abnormalities in the bone or joints Trauma Poor posture Degenerative diseases Tumors Muscle strain The shoulder is a ball and socket joint with a large range of movement. Shoulder pain can stem from one or more of the following causes: Strains from overexertion Tendonitis from overuse Shoulder joint instability Dislocation Collar or upper arm bone fractures Frozen shoulder Pinched nerves (also called radiculopathy) X-rays: Plain X-rays can reveal narrowing of the space between two spinal bones, arthritis-like diseases, tumors, slipped discs, narrowing of the spinal canal, fractures and instability of the spinal column. MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasive procedure that can reveal the detail of neural (nerve-related) elements, as well as problems with the tendons and ligaments. Electrodiagnostic studies: Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) are sometimes used to diagnose neck and shoulder pain, arm pain, numbness and tingling. The treatment of soft tissue neck and shoulder pain often includes the use of anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve or Naprosyn). Depending on the source of pain, drugs like muscle relaxers and even antidepressants might be helpful.

It's a pretty common condition that your eye doctor usually can fix with eyeglasses, contacts, or eye surgery. When your eyeball is too long or the cornea -- the protective outer layer of your eye -- is too curved, the light that enters your eye won't focus correctly. Images focus in front of the retina, the light-sensitive part of your eye, instead of directly on the retina. High myopia: It's a more serious form of the condition, where the eyeball grows more than it is supposed to and becomes very long front to back. Besides making it hard to see things at a distance, it can also raise your chance of having other conditions like a detached retina, cataracts, and glaucoma. Degenerative myopia: Also called pathological or malignant myopia, it is a rare type you usually inherit from the genes of your parents. Besides making it hard to see things at a distance, you may have a higher chance of having a detached retina, abnormal blood vessel growth in the eye (choroid neovascularization), and glaucoma. You may also notice: Headaches Squint Eye strain Eye fatigue when you try to see objects more than a few feet away Children with myopia often have trouble reading the blackboard at school. When you have myopia, your prescription for glasses or contact lenses will be a negative number. Your prescription helps the eye focus light on your retina. Eye surgery can improve your vision so much you may not ever need glasses or contacts again. The most common procedures for myopia are: Photorefractive keratectomy: Also called PRK, this surgery uses a laser to sculpt the middle layer of your cornea. The surgeon uses a laser or another tool to create a thin flap on the top of your cornea. He sculpts the cornea with another laser and moves the flap back into place.

The specific symptoms and severity of NBCCS can vary greatly from one individual to another, even among members of the same family. Common symptoms include multiple basal cell carcinomas, recurrent keratocystic odontogenic tumors of the jaws, pits of the palms and soles, and skeletal malformations. NBCCS is caused by mutations in the PTCH1 gene and is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, but a significant fraction of cases are sporadic (due to new mutations) with no previous family history.

It aims to improve health, prevent disease, and treat illness through the use of organic foods and exercise; a healthy, balanced lifestyle; and the use of treatments from other areas of complementary medicine. Naturopathy was developed in the late 1800s in the United States. Today, a licensed naturopathic doctor (ND) attends a 4-year, graduate-level naturopathic medical school. Most traditional naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) believe in natural therapies, such as nutritional and lifestyle counseling. The disagreement over practice guidelines and licensing requirements in different states has led to some public confusion about the role of the naturopath. People use naturopathic medicine to promote good health, prevent disease, and treat illness. Most naturopaths can treat earaches, allergies, and other common health problems. Naturopathy tries to find the cause of the problem rather than just treating symptoms. Two common concerns about naturopathy are the use of fasting and a bias against vaccines. Not all states require naturopaths to be licensed. In the United States, the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME) is the only agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education to accredit naturopathic programs and colleges. Before you choose a naturopath, find out if the person graduated from an accredited college. Also check to see if your state has licensing laws that govern the practice of NDs.

When you breathe, air flows through your nose into your throat and nasopharynx, and eventually into your lungs. Scientists are not sure what exactly causes nasopharyngeal cancer. However, the cancer has been strongly linked to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Although EBV infection is common, not everyone who has EBV will get nasopharyngeal cancer. In the U.S., most people who have had an EBV infection never have long-term problems. But sometimes, genetic material (DNA) from the virus mixes with the DNA in the cells of the nasopharynx. The change in DNA causes cells to grow and divide abnormally, causing cancer. The risk for NPC goes up if you eat a diet rich in salt-cured fish and meat. Tobacco and alcohol also increase the risk. Some scientists believe that chemicals in these things further damage the DNA in cells. Fewer than one in every 100,000 people in North America gets this type of cancer, according to the American Cancer Society. It is also much more common in: Other parts of Asia North Africa Inuit populations of Alaska and Canada Chinese and Hmong immigrant groups in the U.S. In the U.S., nasopharyngeal cancer has also been seen in African-Americans, Hispanics, and white people. You are more likely to get this type of cancer if you: Are male Under age 55 Eat a diet rich in salt-cured fish and meats Have a family history of nasopharyngeal cancer Have certain genes linked to cancer development Have come in contact with EBV Some, but not all, studies have found a higher risk of nasopharyngeal cancer in people who: Smoke Drink a lot of alcohol Work around wood dust or a chemical called formaldehyde Symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer may include: Blurry or double vision Difficulty speaking, including hoarseness Ear infections that keep coming back Face pain or numbness Headache Hearing loss, ringing in the ears, or a feeling of fullness in the ear Lump in neck or nose Nosebleeds Stuffy nose Sore throat Keep in mind, such symptoms are more likely to occur with many other diseases and health conditions that are far less serious than nasopharyngeal cancer. This includes a detailed look at your ears, nose, and throat. You may be sent to a doctor who specializes in these areas, called an otolaryngologist. Most patients with nasopharyngeal cancer have a lump in the neck. This is a sign that the cancer is spreading to the lymph nodes. Small mirrors and lights or a flexible, lighted tube may be placed through your mouth or nose to help the doctor better view the nasopharynx. If there is a lump in your neck, the biopsy may be done by placing a very thin, hollow needle into the lump. Imaging tests may include: Chest X-ray CT scan MRI Ultrasound of the neck The following tests may also be done to confirm or rule out cancer: Complete blood count (CBC) and other blood tests EBV testing If you are diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer, other tests will be done to determine if and where the cancer has spread. The lower the number, the less the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Stages 3 and 4 are called advanced or late-stage nasopharyngeal cancer. If you are diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer, you will need regular follow-ups with your medical team before, during, and after treatment. Your treatment will depend on many things, including: Location of the tumor Stage of the tumor Your overall health Treatment may include: Radiation Therapy . It may cause fewer side effects or complications than conventional radiation treatment to the nasopharynx, which can lead to: dry mouth inflammation of the lining of your mouth and throat blindness brain stem injury death of healthy tissue Surgery. Surgery can sometimes cure nasopharyngeal cancer if all of the tumor and cancer cells are removed. It may cause permanent damage to the eye and other nearby structures. Not all people with nasopharyngeal cancer can have surgery. Sorafenib (Nexavar), and pazopanib (Votrient) are drugs that also block this protein. Studies show that patients with nasopharyngeal cancer who have lower levels of VEGF are more likely to remain disease-free after treatment. Bevacizumab is currently being evaluated to see if it will help improve your overall survival when combined with other treatments, such as chemotherapy. This includes the drug cetuximab (Erbitux), which targets a protein on the cancer cell's surface. Other drugs that target this protein, including nimotuzumab and icotinib, have shown promising results in clinical trials. But it may help you live longer when combined with radiotherapy or biological drugs. At this time, there is no cure for head and neck cancer that has spread, or metastasized. The goal of treatment is to control your symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible. Researchers are always testing new ways to treat cancer, and they need your help. Ask your doctor or nurse if there are any clinical trials on nasopharyngeal cancer in your area.

Dr. von Binder first identified the condition as a distinct clinical entity in 1962 in a comprehensive report of three children; the disorder now bears his name. There is some debate in the medical literature as to whether Binder type maxillonasal dysplasia is a syndrome or an association.

You may be told you have a \"fatty liver.\" Many people have a buildup of fat in the liver, and for most people it causes no symptoms and no problems. But in some people, the fat causes inflammation and damages cells in the liver. Because of the damage, the liver doesn't work as well as it should. NASH can get worse and cause scarring of the liver, which leads to cirrhosis. NASH is similar to the kind of liver disease that is caused by long-term, heavy drinking. Experts don't know why some people with a buildup of fat in the liver get NASH and some don't. Things that put people at risk for NASH and for liver damage include: Obesity. Most people who have NASH are 40 to 50 years old and have one or more of the problems listed above. You may have no symptoms in the early stages of NASH. As NASH progresses and liver damage gets worse, you may start to have symptoms such as: Fatigue (feeling tired all the time). It may take many years for NASH to become severe enough to cause symptoms. No single test can diagnose NASH. Your doctor will ask you about other health problems you've had. To see if fat is building up in your liver and to rule out other diseases, your doctor may do tests such as: Blood tests. Your doctor may do a liver biopsy to be sure that you have NASH. In a liver biopsy, your doctor takes a sample of tissue from your liver and checks it for signs of NASH. Treatment for NASH includes managing conditions that increase your risk for NASH or make it worse. Losing 3% to 10% of your total body weight can make a difference.1 Control diabetes.

In a typical sleep cycle, we initially enter the early stages of sleep followed by deeper sleep stages and ultimately (after about 90 minutes) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. For people suffering from narcolepsy, REM sleep occurs almost immediately in the sleep cycle, as well as periodically during the waking hours. It is in REM sleep that we can experience dreams and muscle paralysis -- which explains some of the symptoms of narcolepsy. These genes control the production of chemicals in the brain that may signal sleep and awake cycles. Some experts think narcolepsy may be due to a deficiency in the production of a chemical called hypocretin by the brain. In addition, researchers have discovered abnormalities in various parts of the brain involved in regulating REM sleep. According to experts, it is likely narcolepsy involves multiple factors that interact to cause neurological dysfunction and REM sleep disturbances. Symptoms of narcolepsy include: Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS): In general, EDS interferes with normal activities on a daily basis, whether or not a person with narcolepsy has sufficient sleep at night. Cataplexy: This symptom consists of a sudden loss of muscle tone that leads to feelings of weakness and a loss of voluntary muscle control. It can cause symptoms ranging from slurred speech to total body collapse, depending on the muscles involved, and is often triggered by intense emotions such as surprise, laughter, or anger. Several specialized tests, which can be performed in a sleep disorders clinic or sleep lab, usually are required before a diagnosis can be established. Two tests that are considered essential in confirming a diagnosis of narcolepsy are the polysomnogram (PSG) and the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). The PSG is an overnight test that takes continuous multiple measurements while a patient is asleep to document abnormalities in the sleep cycle. A PSG can help reveal whether REM sleep occurs at abnormal times in the sleep cycle and can eliminate the possibility that an individual's symptoms result from another condition. As part of the test, an individual is asked to take four or five short naps usually scheduled two hours apart. Although there is no cure for narcolepsy, the most disabling symptoms of the disorder (EDS and symptoms of abnormal REM sleep, such as cataplexy) can be controlled in most people with drug treatment. This drug, called Xyrem, helps people with narcolepsy get a better night's sleep, allowing them to be less sleepy during the day. Lifestyle adjustments such as avoiding caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and heavy meals, regulating sleep schedules, scheduling daytime naps (10-15 minutes in length), and establishing a normal exercise and meal schedule may also help to reduce symptoms."], [333, "Nanocephalic Dwarfism", "Seckel syndrome is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by growth delays prior to birth (intrauterine growth retardation) resulting in low birth weight.

You might be involved in another activity, such as reading, watching television, or talking on the phone, and bite your nails without thinking about it. Nail-biting includes biting the cuticle and soft tissue surrounding the nail as well as biting the nail itself. About half of all children between the ages of 10 and 18 bite their nails at one time or another. Some young adults, ages 18 to 22 years, bite their nails. Nail-biting may occur with other body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRB) such as hair-pulling or skin-picking. Several treatment measures may help you stop biting your nails. Taking care of your nails can help reduce your nail-biting habit and encourage you to keep your nails attractive. Wearing artificial nails may stop you from biting your nails and protect them as they grow out. Try stress-management techniques if you bite your nails because you are anxious or stressed. Paint a bitter-tasting polish, such as CONTROL-IT or Thum, on your nails. The awful taste will remind you to stop every time you start to bite your nails. Try substituting another activity, such as drawing or writing or squeezing a stress ball or Silly Putty, when you find yourself biting your nails. If you keep a record of nail-biting, you will become more aware of the times when you bite your nails and be able to stop the habit. Wear gloves, adhesive bandages, or colored stickers whenever possible to remind you not to bite your nails. Snap a rubber band on the inside of your wrist when you start to bite your nails so you have a negative physical response to nail-biting. Children may bite their nails more often when they are having problems at school or with friends. Children are more likely to stop biting their nails when they understand what may trigger it. It is also important for your child to help choose a treatment method so he or she can use the treatment successfully."], [336, "Nail Infections Fungal", "Nail fungus, or onychomycosis, is a condition that occurs when a microscopic fungus enters either a fingernail or toenail. Usually, nail fungus occurs when fungus enters the nail through a small trauma (cut or break) in the nail. He or she may scrape some debris from under a nail and look at it under a microscope or send it to a lab to determine what kind of infection you have. Treatment for a nail fungus may include topical creams, gels, nail lacquers, or oral medications (antifungal drugs). Although seldom done, removal of the infected nail can be performed to permit direct application of a topical antifungal. Oral drugs, such as terbinafine, can cure almost 50% of nail fungus infections. Toenail infections are more difficult to treat than fingernail infections because the toenail grows more slowly. In addition, a damp, warm environment of a shoe or boot can encourage fungal growth. Keep the inside of your shoes dry and change socks frequently (100% cotton socks are recommended). Wear shoes that fit properly (shoes with a wide toe area and ones that don't press your toes). Ingrown toenails can occur when the corner or side of the nail grows into the flesh of the toe. In many cases, ingrown nails occur in the big toe. Some common causes of ingrown toenail include cutting the nails too short or not straight across, injury to the toenail, and wearing shoes that crowd the toenails. In mild cases, ingrown toenails may be treated with a 15-20-minute soak in warm water. Talk to your doctor if you are experiencing increasing pain, swelling, and drainage of the area.

Nausea and vomiting are not diseases, but they are symptoms of many conditions such as: Motion sickness or seasickness Early stages of pregnancy (nausea occurs in approximately 50%-90% of all pregnancies; vomiting in 25%-55%) Medication-induced vomiting Intense pain Emotional stress (such as fear) Gallbladder disease Food poisoning Infections (such as the \"stomach flu\") Overeating A reaction to certain smells or odors Heart attack Concussion or brain injury Brain tumor Ulcers Some forms of cancer Bulimia or other psychological illnesses Gastroparesis or slow stomach emptying (a condition that can be seen in people with diabetes) Ingestion of toxins or excessive amounts of alcohol The causes of vomiting differ according to age. For children, it is common for vomiting to occur from a viral infection, food poisoning, milk allergy, motion sickness, overeating or feeding, coughing, or blocked intestines and illnesses in which the child has a high fever. When appearing shortly after a meal, nausea or vomiting may be caused by food poisoning, gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining), an ulcer, or bulimia. Nausea or vomiting one to eight hours after a meal may also indicate food poisoning. Some examples of serious conditions that may result in nausea or vomiting include concussions, meningitis (infection of the membrane linings of the brain), intestinal blockage, appendicitis, and brain tumors. Adults have a lower risk of becoming dehydrated, because they can usually detect the symptoms of dehydration (such as increased thirst and dry lips or mouth). But young children have a greater risk of becoming dehydrated, especially if they also have diarrhea, because they often are unable to communicate symptoms of dehydration. Adults caring for sick children need to be aware of these visible signs of dehydration: dry lips and mouth, sunken eyes, and rapid breathing or pulse. Recurrent vomiting in pregnancy can lead to a serious condition called hyperemesis gravidarum in which the mother may develop fluid and mineral imbalances that can endanger her life or that of her unborn child. Rarely, excessive vomiting can tear the lining of the esophagus, also known as a Mallory-Weiss tear. Call a doctor about nausea and vomiting: If the nausea lasts for more than a few days or if there is a possibility of being pregnant If home treatment is not working, dehydration is present, or a known injury has occurred (such as head injury or infection) that may be causing the vomiting Adults should consult a doctor if vomiting occurs for more than one day, diarrhea and vomiting last more than 24 hours, or there are signs of dehydration. Take a child over age six years to the doctor if vomiting lasts one day, diarrhea combined with vomiting lasts for more than 24 hours, there are any signs of dehydration, there is a fever higher than 101 degrees, or the child hasn't urinated for six hours. You should seek immediate medical care if any of the following situations occur with vomiting: There is blood in the vomit (bright red or \"coffee grounds\" in appearance) Severe headache or stiff neck Lethargy, confusion, or a decreased alertness Severe abdominal pain Diarrhea Rapid breathing or pulse Treatment for vomiting (regardless of age or cause) includes: Drinking gradually larger amounts of clear liquids Avoiding solid food until the vomiting episode has passed If vomiting and diarrhea last more than 24 hours, an oral rehydrating solution such as Pedialyte should be used to prevent and treat dehydration. Pregnant women experiencing morning sickness can eat some crackers before getting out of bed or eat a high protein snack before going to bed (lean meat or cheese). There are also prescription and nonprescription drugs that can be used to control vomiting associated with pregnancy, motion sickness, and some forms of dizziness. When you begin to feel nauseated, you may be able to prevent vomiting by: Drinking small amounts of clear, sweetened liquids such as soda or fruit juices (except orange and grapefruit juices, because these are too acidic) Resting either in a sitting position or in a propped lying position; activity may worsen nausea and may lead to vomiting. To prevent nausea and vomiting in children: To treat motion sickness in a car, seat your child so he or she faces the front windshield (watching fast movement out the side windows can make the nausea worse). Also, reading or playing video games in the car could cause motion sickness."], [338, "N-Acetylglucosamine-1-Phosphotransferase...", "I-cell disease (mucolipidosis II) is a rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by coarse facial features, skeletal abnormalities and mental retardation. The symptoms associated with this disorder typically become obvious during infancy and may include multiple abnormalities of the skull and face and growth delays. Multiple enzyme deficiencies associated with I-cell disease lead to the accumulation of certain fatty substances (mucolipids) and certain complex carbohydrates (mucopolysaccharides) within the cells of many tissues of the body. I-cell disease is caused by a mutation in the GNPTA gene that leads to a deficiency in the enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucoseamine-1-phosphotransferase."], [339, "Overweight Child", "One third of children in the U. S. is overweight or obese, and this number is continuing to rise. However, overweight children are at high risk of becoming overweight adolescents and adults, placing them at risk of developing chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes later in life. The most common causes are genetic factors, lack of physical activity, unhealthy eating patterns, or a combination of these factors. A physical exam and some blood tests can rule out the possibility of a medical condition as the cause for obesity. Although weight problems run in families, not all children with a family history of obesity will be overweight. Children whose parents or brothers or sisters are overweight may be at an increased risk of becoming overweight themselves, but this can be linked to shared family behaviors such as eating and activity habits. Obese children are at risk for a number of conditions, including: High cholesterol High blood pressure Early heart disease Diabetes Bone problems Skin conditions such as heat rash, fungal infections, and acne The best person to determine whether or not your child is overweight is your child's doctor. In determining whether or not your child is overweight, the doctor will measure your child's weight and height and compute his ''BMI,'' or body mass index, to compare this value to standard values. The doctor will also consider your child's age and growth patterns. Children's feelings about themselves often are based on their parents' feelings about them, and if you accept your children at any weight, they will be more likely to feel good about themselves. By involving the entire family, everyone is taught healthful habits and the overweight child does not feel singled out. There are many ways to involve the entire family in healthy habits, but increasing the family's physical activity is especially important. If your children see that you are physically active and having fun, they are more likely to be active and stay active for the rest of their lives. It is important to help your child find physical activities that they enjoy and that aren't embarrassing or too difficult. Make an effort to reduce the amount of time you and your family spend in sedentary activities, such as watching TV or playing video games. Whatever approach parents choose to take regarding an overweight child, the purpose is not to make physical activity and following a healthy diet a chore, but to make the most of the opportunities you and your family have to be active and healthy."], [340, "Over-the-Counter Medications (OTC)", "A nonprescription medicine-sometimes called an over-the-counter, or OTC, medicine-is any drug that you can buy without a doctor's prescription.

Your thyroid is a gland in the front of your neck . It also affects your heart, muscles, bones, and cholesterol. Having too much thyroid hormone can make a lot of things in your body speed up. You may lose weight quickly, have a fast heartbeat, sweat a lot, or feel nervous and moody. While your doctor is doing a test for another reason, he or she may discover that you have hyperthyroidism. With treatment, you can lead a healthy life. Without treatment, hyperthyroidism can lead to serious heart problems, bone problems, and a dangerous condition called thyroid storm. In Graves' disease, the body's natural defense (immune) system attacks the thyroid gland. Like many thyroid problems, it often runs in families. Sometimes hyperthyroidism is caused by a swollen thyroid or small growths in the thyroid called thyroid nodules. Your hands may shake, your heart may beat fast, or you may have problems breathing. You may be hot and sweaty or have warm, red, itchy skin. Without treatment, hyperthyroidism can lead to heart problems, bone problems, and a dangerous condition called thyroid storm. Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and do a physical exam. Then he or she will order blood tests to see how much thyroid hormone your body is making. Sometimes hyperthyroidism is found while you are having a test for another reason. You may be surprised to find out that you have this problem. If your symptoms bother you, your doctor may give you pills called beta-blockers. These can help you feel better while you and your doctor decide what your treatment should be. Hyperthyroidism can lead to more serious problems. So even if your symptoms do not bother you, you still need treatment. Radioactive iodine and antithyroid medicine are the treatments doctors use most often. The best treatment for you will depend on a number of things, including your age.

If they stop working, you may need to try radioactive iodine. After treatment, you will need regular blood tests. These tests check to see if your hyperthyroidism has come back. They also check to see if you are making enough thyroid hormone. Sometimes treatment cures hyperthyroidism but causes the opposite problem-too little thyroid hormone. If this happens, you may need to take thyroid hormone pills for the rest of your life. Can a test find thyroid problems early? What can I do at home to manage my hyperthyroidism?"], [342, "Ovarian Epithelial Cancer: About", "Ovarian epithelial cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissue covering the ovary. The ovaries are a pair of organs in the female reproductive system. They are in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus (the hollow, pear-shaped organ where a fetus grows). The uterus has a muscular outer layer called the myometrium and an inner lining called the endometrium. Ovarian epithelial cancer is one type of cancer that affects the ovary. See the following PDQ treatment summaries for information about other types of ovarian tumors: Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors Unusual Cancers of Childhood Women who have a family history of ovarian cancer are at an increased risk of ovarian cancer. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Women who have one first-degree relative (mother, daughter, or sister) with ovarian cancer are at an increased risk of ovarian cancer. This risk is higher in women who have one first-degree relative and one second-degree relative (grandmother or aunt) with ovarian cancer. This risk is even higher in women who have two or more first-degree relatives with ovarian cancer. Some ovarian cancers are caused by inherited gene mutations (changes). The genes in cells carry the hereditary information that is received from a person's parents. Hereditary ovarian cancer makes up about 5% to 10% of all cases of ovarian cancer. Three hereditary patterns have been identified: ovarian cancer alone, ovarian and breast cancers, and ovarian and colon cancers. These genetic tests are sometimes done for members of families with a high risk of cancer. See the following PDQ summaries for more information: Ovarian Cancer Screening Ovarian Cancer Prevention Genetics of Breast and Ovarian Cancer Women with an increased risk of ovarian cancer may consider surgery to prevent it. Some women who have an increased risk of ovarian cancer may choose to have a prophylactic oophorectomy (the removal of healthy ovaries so that cancer cannot grow in them). In high-risk women, this procedure has been shown to greatly decrease the risk of ovarian cancer. (See the PDQ summary on Ovarian Cancer Prevention for more information.) Signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer include pain or swelling in the abdomen. Signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer may include the following: Pain or swelling in the abdomen. These signs and symptoms also may be caused by other conditions and not by ovarian cancer. Women with any stage of ovarian cancer should think about taking part in a clinical trial. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI Web site. Tests that examine the ovaries and pelvic area are used to detect (find) and diagnose ovarian cancer. The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Pelvic exam : An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum. A speculum is also inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. CA 125assay: A test that measures the level of CA 125 in the blood. An increased CA 125 level is sometimes a sign of cancer or other condition. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer.

Usually the sac goes away after the egg is released. If an egg is not released, or if the sac closes up after the egg is released, the sac can swell up with fluid. Functional ovarian cysts are different from ovarian growths caused by other problems, such as cancer. They do not cause symptoms, and they go away without treatment. But if a cyst becomes large, it can twist, rupture, or bleed and can be very painful. A functional ovarian cyst forms because of slight changes in the way the ovary makes or releases an egg. There are two types of these cysts: A follicular cyst occurs when a sac on the ovary does not release an egg, and the sac swells up with fluid. A luteal cyst occurs when the sac releases an egg and then reseals and fills with fluid. Most functional ovarian cysts do not cause symptoms. The larger the cyst is, the more likely it is to cause symptoms. Symptoms can include: Pain or aching in your lower belly, usually when you are in the middle of your menstrual cycle. Vaginal bleeding when you are not having your period. Some functional ovarian cysts can twist or break open (rupture) and bleed. Symptoms include: Sudden, severe pain, often with nausea and vomiting. If you have these symptoms, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may find an ovarian cyst during a pelvic exam. He or she may then use a pelvic ultrasound to make sure that the cyst is filled with fluid. He or she will do a pelvic exam and may do a pelvic ultrasound.

Many general dentists are doing basic alignment and orthodontics, but orthodontists specialize in correcting irregularities of the teeth. The dentist or orthodontist you choose will ask questions about your health, conduct a clinical exam, take impressions of your teeth, take photos of your face and teeth, and order X-rays of the mouth and head. If braces are indeed the solution for you, the dentist or orthodontist will prescribe an appliance specific for your needs. The braces may consist of bands, wires, and other fixed or removable corrective appliances. In their entirety, braces work by applying continuous pressure over a period of time to slowly move teeth in a specific direction. Braces are made up of the following components: Brackets are the small squares that are bonded directly to the front of each tooth with a special dental bonding agent or are attached to orthodontic bands. Orthodontic bands are stainless steel, clear, or tooth-colored materials that are cemented to the teeth with dental bonding agents. Arch wires attach to the brackets and act as tracks to guide the movement of the teeth. Springs may be placed on the arch wires between brackets to push, pull, open, or close the spaces between teeth. Two bands on the upper teeth may have headgear tubes on them to hold the facebow of the headgear in place. (A headgear is another tool used by orthodontists to aid in correcting irregularities of the teeth; see below) Elastics or rubber bands attach to hooks on brackets and are worn between the upper and lower teeth in various ways. They apply pressure to move the upper teeth against the lower teeth to achieve a perfect fit of individual teeth. Facebow headgear is the wire gadget that is used to move the upper molars back in the mouth to correct bite discrepancies and also to create room for crowded teeth. Your orthodontist will discuss the various types of braces with you and determine which might be the best option for your situation. The time required for braces varies from person to person, depending on the severity of the problem; the amount of room available; the distance the teeth must travel; the health of the teeth, gums, and supporting bone; and how closely the patient follows instructions. On average, however, once the braces are put on, they usually remain in place for one to three years. After braces are removed, most patients will need to wear a retainer all the time for the first six months, then only during sleep for many years. Your orthodontist will want to see you about every month or so in order to make sure the braces are exerting steady pressure on the teeth. To create more tension and pressure on your teeth, the orthodontist will make adjustments in the wires, springs, or rubber bands of the braces. In some cases, braces alone aren't enough to straighten the teeth or shift the jaw. Some of the adjustments your orthodontist may make to your braces may make your mouth feel sore or uncomfortable. If you always experience a lot of pain after your braces are adjusted, talk to your orthodontist about it; he or she may be able to make the adjustments a bit differently. The mechanical process used to move teeth with braces is the same at any age. So the benefits of orthodontic treatments are available to both children and adults who wish to improve their appearance and bite. The main differences between treatments in adults and children is that certain corrections in adults may require more than braces alone and the treatments may take longer because adult bones are no longer growing. The mouthguard, made of durable plastic, is designed to fit comfortably over your braces and will protect the soft tissues inside the mouth. Your orthodontist may want to take another set of X-rays and bite impressions to check how well the braces straightened your teeth and to see if any wisdom teeth have developed. If wisdom teeth are beginning to come in after braces have been removed, your dentist or orthodontist may recommend the wisdom teeth be pulled to prevent newly straightened teeth from shifting. Retainers, which are typically made of rubber or clear plastic and metal wires that cover the outside surface of the teeth, need to be worn all the time for the first six months and then usually only during sleep. The time frame for wearing a retainer will vary from patient to patient. The reason why a retainer is needed is that even though braces may have successfully straightened your teeth, they are not completely settled in their new position until the bones, gums, and muscles adapt to the change. The cost of braces varies, but you can expect the cost for conventional metal braces to average $5,000 (or less in rural areas)."], [349, "Oromaxillary Fistula Repair", "An oromaxillary fistula is an abnormal passageway between one of the sinuses on either side of your nose (maxillary sinuses ) and the roof of your mouth.

That's precisely why you and your loved ones need to gather as much information as possible on organ transplants, as soon as possible. In the United States, 7 types of organ transplants are now performed, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), a nonprofit organization in Richmond Va. UNOS administers the country's only Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, which includes the organ transplant waiting list. Organ transplants include kidney, pancreas, liver, heart, lung, and intestine. Vascularized composite allografts (VCAs), are now also possible, including face and hand transplantation. In 2015, over 25,000 people received organs in the U.S., according to UNOS. Kidney transplants are the most common type of transplant surgery; the least common single-organ transplants are the intestines. Depending on the organ needed, organs are matched using several characteristics, including blood type and size of the organ needed. You aren't bound to go to the recommended center, says Gigi Spicer, RN, director of the Virginia Transplant Center at Henrico Doctors' Hospital in Richmond, Va. It's a mistake to give up and let your health care team make all the decisions, Spicer says. Start by searching for transplant centers by organ type, and then by state or by region, on the UNOS web page. Transplant web site, which is maintained by the University of Michigan's Ann Arbor Research Collaborative for Health. Included in the reports are waiting times, number of living vs. deceased donors, survival rates, and other facts. To get on the national transplant waiting list, UNOS tells potential recipients, contact the transplant hospital you and your doctor have decided on and ask for an appointment. You will be evaluated by the organ transplant team, which will take into account your medical history, current health status, and other variables to see if you are indeed a good candidate for the transplant. If the team accepts you as a candidate, it will add you to the national waiting list maintained by UNOS. UNOS keeps a running total of the transplant waiting lists in the entire nation, organ by organ, on its web site and updates it regularly. In January 2016, about 122,000 people were on the waiting list nationwide for organs of all types. The average wait time for an organ transplant varies by organ, age, blood type, and other factors. UNOS has an online database known as UNET, which collects, stores, and analyzes data on the patient waiting list, organ matching, and the transplants. All U.S. organ transplant programs, as well as organ procurement organizations and tissue typing labs, work together to share the organs. The database allows the facilities to register patients, match donated organs to patients on the transplant waiting list, and manage the data of transplant patients before and after the surgery. Among other requirements, the centers are now required to perform an average of 10 transplants a year, with some exceptions allowed, to keep federal funding. But if no match is found, the organ is offered to a good match regionally and then nationally, if necessary. Living donors are arranged through the individual transplant centers, according to UNOS. Another option, if you need a kidney transplant, is to contact the National Kidney Foundation's National Donor Family Council. This is when someone who doesn't match the intended donor can still donate the organ for someone else's use, and the intended donor goes to the top of the transplant list. In the United States, it is a felony to buy an organ. Though other countries allow the sale of organs, a doctor practicing in the U.S. would not place that organ, Spicer says. Depending on the organ being transplanted, you can get other help from a variety of organizations.

Risk factors for the development of oral cancer include: Smoking . Users of dip, snuff, or chewing tobacco products are 50 times more likely to develop cancers of the cheek, gums, and lining of the lips. Certain HPV strains are etiologic risk factors for Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) It is important to note that over 25% of all oral cancers occur in people who do not smoke and who only drink alcohol occasionally. The overall 1-year survival rate for patients with all stages of oral cavity and pharynx cancers is 81%. As part of your routine dental exam, your dentist will conduct an oral cancer screening exam. More specifically, your dentist will feel for any lumps or irregular tissue changes in your neck, head, face, and oral cavity. When examining your mouth, your dentist will look for any sores or discolored tissue as well as check for any signs and symptoms mentioned above. Also there are different types of scalpel biopsies, incisional and excisional, depending whether only a piece or the whole area is needed to determine what the nature of the problem is. Oral cancer is treated the same way many other cancers are treated -- with surgery to remove the cancerous growth, followed by radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy (drug treatments) to destroy any remaining cancer cells. To prevent oral cancer: Don't smoke or use any tobacco products and drink alcohol in moderation (and refrain from binge drinking). Repeated exposure increases the risk of cancer on the lip, especially the lower lip. You can take an active role in detecting oral cancer early, should it occur, by doing the following: Conduct a self exam at least once a month. Using a bright light and a mirror, look and feel your lips and front of your gums. Tilt your head back and look at and feel the roof of your mouth. Pull your checks out to view the inside of your mouth, the lining of your cheeks, and the back gums. Pull out your tongue and look at all surfaces; examine the floor of your mouth. Feel for lumps or enlarged lymph nodes in both sides of your neck and under your lower jaw. Call your dentist's office immediately if you notice any changes in the appearance of your mouth or any of the signs and symptoms mentioned above.

A fungal nail infection could lead to more serious problems if you have diabetes or a weak immune system. Talk to your doctor about the best way to treat a nail infection if you have one of these problems. Yeasts, molds, and different kinds of fungi can cause fungal nail infections. Fungi grow best in warm, moist places, and they can spread from person to person. You can get a fungal nail infection from walking barefoot in public showers or pools or by sharing personal items, such as towels and nail clippers.

The second part of this tube -- the large intestine -- is composed of the colon, which stretches 4 feet to 6 feet, and the rectum, which is only 4 inches to 6 inches long. The inner lining of this \"colorectal tube\" can be a fertile breeding ground for small tumors, called polyps (Figure 1). Most polyps are benign, but at least one type is known to be precancerous. If colorectal cancer is diagnosed and treated early while the tumor is still localized, the disease is highly curable, with five-year survival rates of about 90%. If the tumor continues to grow, cancer can spread directly through the bowel wall to surrounding lymph nodes, tissues, and organs, as well as into the bloodstream. Once the cancer spreads to lymph nodes or other organs, successful treatment becomes more difficult. Depending on how advanced the disease is, five-year survival rates range from 11% to 87%. Cancers of the colon and rectum are common, with approximately 135,000 cases diagnosed each year. Like many cancers, colorectal cancer is of particular concern for people older than age 50. Although diagnosis is often possible at an early stage, many people delay seeking medical care because they are embarrassed or fearful of symptoms related to their bowels. Risk increases significantly after age 50 and continues to increase with age. Colorectal cancer is strongly associated with certain other diseases. Those people considered at high risk include anyone with a personal or family history of colon polyps or colon cancer, inflammatory disease of the colon such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, and cancers of the pancreas, breast, ovaries, or uterus. A few people inherit medical conditions, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), MYH-associated polyposis (MAP), Gardner's syndrome, Turcot's syndrome, Peutz-Jagher's syndrome, juvenile polyposis, and Cowden's disease. In all of these disorders, colon polyps develop at an early age, and unless treated, these people are at high risk of developing colorectal cancer. The disease extends from generation to generation and causes a person to develop colon cancer. This disease is associated with other cancers including endometrial, ovarian, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, kidney, ureter, brain, and bile duct. Diet also contributes to the risk of colorectal cancer, although the cause-and-effect relationship is still unclear. People whose diets are high in fruits and vegetables seem to have a reduced risk. Many studies implicate animal fat and protein as promoters of colorectal cancer, although researchers are cautious about drawing any definite conclusions. Some studies show that regularly eating red meat, which is rich in saturated fat and protein, increases risk, while others find no connection. Some scientists note that fat is the main culprit, while others suspect protein. Others contend that it's not the fat and protein themselves, but the way they are cooked. Surgeries such as ureterosigmoidostomy, which is performed in the treatment of bladder cancer, and a cholecsytecomy (the removal of the gallbladder).

And it is sometimes recommended when the hormones produced by the ovaries are making a disease such as breast cancer or severe endometriosis worse. In some cases the ovaries are removed to try to reduce the possibility of developing a future disease, such as ovarian cancer. Oophorectomy is done for conditions and diseases such as: Heredity (inherited) diseases. If your mother or sister has had ovarian cancer, or you know that you have an abnormal BRCA gene, you may consider having your ovaries removed. Hormones produced by the ovaries increase the risk of breast cancer. Oophorectomy is sometimes recommended to treat breast cancer, because it eliminates the hormones produced by the ovaries. When a premenopausal woman is scheduled to have one ovary removed during the surgical removal of the uterus (hysterectomy) because disease is suspected, removal of both ovaries may be recommended if disease is found. If you do not have an increased risk of ovarian cancer or another disease that requires the removal of your ovaries, consider the benefits of not having your ovaries removed. When an oophorectomy is done before a woman's natural age of menopause, hormones may be prescribed afterward to reduce the risk of osteoporosis, hot flashes, and other menopausal symptoms. Removal of the ovaries increases the risk for developing weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis), because the body no longer produces a large amount of estrogen.

This device, called Inspire, has a small pulse generator that the surgeon places under the skin in your upper chest. Also, people who have Inspire use a remote to turn it on before bed and turn it off when they wake up in the morning. Doctors use radiofrequency energy to tighten the soft palate at the back of the throat. UPPP, or UP3, is a procedure that removes soft tissue in the back of the throat and palate, increasing the width of the airway at the throat opening.

This leads to stiffening of the walls of the heart and abnormal aortic and mitral heart valve function, both of which may impede normal blood flow out of the heart. Many people with HCM have no symptoms or only minor symptoms, and live a normal life. Other people develop symptoms, which progress and worsen as heart function worsens. Symptoms of HCM can occur at any age and may include: Chest pain or pressure (occurs usually with exercise or physical activity, but can also occur with rest or after meals) Shortness of breath (dyspnea), especially with exertion Fatigue (feeling overly tired) Fainting (caused by irregular heart rhythms, abnormal responses of the blood vessels during exercise, or no cause may be found) Palpitations (fluttering in the chest) due to abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias), such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia Sudden death (occurs in a small number of patients with HCM) HCM can run in families, but the condition may also be acquired as a part of aging or high blood pressure. HCM is diagnosed based on medical history (your symptoms and family history), a physical exam, and echocardiogram results. Additional tests may include blood tests, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, exercise stress test, cardiac catheterization, CT scan, and MRI. Treatment of HCM depends on whether there is narrowing in the path that blood takes to leave the heart (called the outflow tract); how the heart is functioning; and if arrhythmias are present. Treatment is aimed at preventing symptoms and complications and includes risk identification and regular follow-up, lifestyle changes, medications, and procedures as needed. Fluid and salt restrictions may be necessary for some patients if heart failure symptoms are present. However, your doctor may ask you not to exercise, based on your symptoms and the severity of your disease. Patients with HCM should have an annual follow-up visit with their cardiologist to monitor their condition. Drugs are often used to treat symptoms and prevent further complications of HCM. If you have an arrhythmia, your doctor may prescribe medications to control your heart rate or decrease the occurrence of arrhythmias. You may be told to avoid certain medications, such as nitrates, because they lower blood pressure, or digoxin, because it increases the force of the heart's contraction. Non-obstructive HCM symptoms may be treated with medications. During this surgical procedure, the surgeon removes a small amount of the thickened septal wall of the heart to widen the outflow tract (the path the blood takes) from the left ventricle to the aorta. First, a cardiologist (heart doctor) performs a cardiac catheterization to locate the small coronary artery that supplies blood flow to the septum. The alcohol kills the cells on contact, causing a small \"controlled\" heart attack. ICDs are suggested for people at risk for life-threatening arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. When it detects a very fast, abnormal heart rhythm, it delivers energy to the heart muscle to cause the heart to beat in a normal rhythm again. A small number of people with HCM have an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. People at risk include: Those who have family members who have had sudden cardiac death Young people with HCM who have had several episodes of fainting Those who have an abnormal blood pressure response with exercise Adults who have a history of arrhythmia with a fast heart rate Those with severe symptoms and poor heart function If you have two or more risk factors for sudden cardiac death, your doctor will treat you with medications to prevent arrhythmias or with an ICD. Most people with HCM are at low risk for sudden cardiac death. People with obstructive HCM may be at increased risk for infective endocarditis, a potentially life-threatening condition. Ask your doctor if you need to take endocarditis precautions, which include: Telling all your doctors and dentist you have HCM. They should prescribe antibiotics to prevent an infection before performing any procedures on you that may cause bleeding (dental, respiratory, and gastrointestinal procedures)."], [388, "Obstetric Panel", "An obstetric panel is a group of blood tests done to check the health of a woman before and during early pregnancy.

Another test can show if you are immune to rubella, also known as German measles."], [389, "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)", "It is a potentially disabling illness that traps people in endless cycles of repetitive thoughts and behaviors. People with OCD are plagued by recurring and distressing thoughts, fears, or images (obsessions) they cannot control. The anxiety (nervousness) produced by these thoughts leads to an urgent need to perform certain rituals or routines (compulsions). Although the ritual may temporarily alleviate anxiety, the person must perform the ritual again when the obsessive thoughts return. This OCD cycle can progress to the point of taking up hours of the person's day and significantly interfering with normal activities. Common obsessions include: Fear of dirt or contamination by germs Fear of causing harm to another Fear of making a mistake Fear of being embarrassed or behaving in a socially unacceptable manner Fear of thinking evil or sinful thoughts Need for order, symmetry, or exactness Excessive doubt and the need for constant reassurance Common compulsions include: Repeatedly bathing, showering, or washing hands Refusing to shake hands or touch doorknobs Repeatedly checking things, such as locks or stoves Constant counting, mentally or aloud, while performing routine tasks Constantly arranging things in a certain way Eating foods in a specific order Being stuck on words, images or thoughts, usually disturbing, that won't go away and can interfere with sleep Repeating specific words, phrases, or prayers Needing to perform tasks a certain number of times Collecting or hoarding items with no apparent value Although the exact cause of OCD is not fully understood, studies have shown that a combination of biological and environmental factors may be involved. At one time, it was thought that low levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin was responsible for the development of OCD. Now, however, scientists think that OCD arises from problems in the pathways of the brain that link areas dealing with judgment and planning with another area that filters messages involving body movements. In addition, there is evidence that OCD symptoms can sometimes get passed on from parents to children. Studies also have found a link between a certain type of infection caused by the Streptococcus bacteria and OCD. This infection, if recurrent and untreated, may lead to the development of OCD and other disorders in children. Environmental Factors: There are environmental stressors that can trigger OCD in people with a tendency toward developing the condition. These factors include: Abuse Changes in living situation Illness Death of a loved one Work- or school-related changes or problems Relationship concerns About 3.3 million adults and about 1 million children and adolescents in the U.S. have OCD. The doctor bases his or her diagnosis on an assessment of the patient's symptoms, including how much time the person spends performing his or her ritual behaviors. Cognitive behavioral therapy : The goal of cognitive behavioral therapy is to teach people with OCD to confront their fears and reduce anxiety without performing the ritual behaviors (called exposure therapy or exposure and response prevention therapy). Therapy also focuses on reducing the exaggerated or catastrophic thinking that often occurs in people with OCD. Medication therapy : Antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) like Luvox, Prozac, and Zoloft, may be helpful in treating OCD. Some atypical antipsychotics, such as Risperdal or Abilify, also have been shown to have value for OCD either when used alone or in combination with an SSRI. In severe cases of OCD and in people who do not respond to medical and behavioral therapy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or psychosurgery may be used to treat the disorder. During ECT, a small current is passed through electrodes placed on the scalp while the patient is asleep under general anesthesia This causes a brief seizure. A newer, surgical form of brain stimulation called deep brain stimulation (DBS) involves implanting small electrodes into brain areas that are a part of the brain circuitry associated with OCD symptoms."], [390, "Obrinsky Syndrome", "Prune-Belly syndrome, also known as Eagle-Barrett syndrome, is a rare disorder characterized by partial or complete absence of the stomach (abdominal) muscles, failure of both testes to descend into the scrotum (bilateral cryptorchidism), and/or urinary tract malformations.

And losing even some weight can make a big difference to your health and how you feel. You may not have to lose as much as you might think in order to start seeing health benefits. Adults who are overweight or obese should try to lose 5% to 10% of their current weight over 6 months, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. If you're ready to get started with a weight loss program, ask your doctor to help you set personal goals and refer you to other professionals who can give you tips and help you reach your goals.

Children who get it before age 2 also can have one iris (the colored area around the pupil) that's a lighter color than the other one. Horner syndrome can be a sign of a serious health risk such as nerve damage. Horner syndrome usually is caused by some kind of damage to a string of nerves that help control your eyes, heart rate, sweat, and blood pressure. Many things can affect the flow of signals through them: Cancer Cysts or tumors Damage to your aorta (the main blood vessel to your heart) or the myelin (a thin sheath around your nerves) Infection at the base of your skull Injuries to your carotid artery or jugular vein, which carry blood through your neck Migraines and cluster headaches Stroke Surgery Neck or shoulder injuries during delivery can cause Horner syndrome in some babies, but it's very rare. Your doctor or an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) can do tests to see if you have Horner syndrome. She'll do a physical exam and ask about your medical history to find out if you've had any illness or injury that could have caused nerve damage. If you have Horner syndrome, one pupil won't widen or shrink as much as it should when the drops go in. Other tests may show if you have any kind of growth, damage, or injury that could cause it. The doctor may ask for any of the following: X-rays MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): Powerful magnets and radio waves used to make detailed images CT scan (computerized tomography): Several X-rays taken from different angles and put together to show a more complete picture Your doctor also may want to test your blood or urine to check for any health problems that could cause nerve damage."], [393, "OAV Spectrum", "Oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum (OAVS) refers to three rare disorders that many clinicians believe to be intimately related to one another and which represent the range of severity of the same disorder.

However, such abnormalities tend to involve the cheekbones, jaw, mouth, ears, eyes, and/or bones of the spinal column (vertebrae). Although, in most cases (about 60%), such malformations affect one side of the body (unilateral), approximately 10 to 33 percent of affected individuals have such malformations on both sides of the body (bilateral), with one side typically more affected than the other (asymmetry).

When you walk or exercise, your leg muscles don't get enough blood and you can get painful cramps. This topic focuses on peripheral arterial disease of the legs, the area where it is most common. Plaque is made of extra cholesterol, calcium, and other material in your blood. Over time, plaque builds up in the walls of the arteries, including those that supply blood to your legs. High cholesterol, high blood pressure, and smoking all contribute to plaque buildup. If plaque builds up in your arteries, there is less room for blood to flow. But plaque buildup prevents that blood from flowing freely and starves the muscles and other tissues in the lower body. Many people who have PAD don't have any symptoms. But if you do have symptoms, you may have a tight, aching, or squeezing pain in the calf, thigh, or buttock. As PAD gets worse, you may have pain in your foot or toe when you aren't walking. During the exam, your doctor will check your pulse at your groin, behind your knee, on the inner ankle, and on the top of your foot. An absent or weak pulse in these spots is a sign of PAD. The color of your foot can be a clue to whether enough blood is getting through your arteries. You will likely have a test that compares the blood pressure in your legs with the blood pressure in your arms. A test called an arterial Doppler ultrasound may be done to check the blood flow in your arteries. Blood tests to check your cholesterol and blood sugar can tell whether you may have other problems related to PAD, such as high cholesterol and diabetes. In some cases, you may need surgery or a procedure called angioplasty. When you have PAD, you have a high risk of having a heart attack or stroke. If you have diabetes, keep your blood sugar in a target range. In cardiac rehab, you will get education and support to help you make new, healthy habits. If lifestyle changes don't help relieve symptoms, your doctor may prescribe a medicine that may relieve the pain when you walk. For severe PAD, you may need a procedure called angioplasty or bypass surgery to open narrowed arteries or to reroute blood flow around them. In rare cases, advanced PAD can cause tissues in the leg or foot to die because they don't get enough oxygen as a result of poor blood flow. If this happens, part of the leg or foot must be removed (amputated)."], [403, "Purpura, Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic", "Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP) is a rare, serious blood disease.

The severity of the symptoms is related to the degree of blood flow obstruction from the right ventricle. Blood travels from the right ventricle through the pulmonary artery to the lungs where it receives oxygen. The blood returns to the heart through pulmonary veins and enters the left ventricle. The left ventricle sends the now oxygen-filled blood into the main artery of the body (aorta).

In most cases, the clots are small and are not deadly, but they can damage the lung. But if the clot is large and stops blood flow to the lung, it can be deadly. Quick treatment could save your life or reduce the risk of future problems. Sharp chest pain that is worse when you cough or take a deep breath. Pulmonary embolism can also cause more general symptoms. For example, you may feel anxious or on edge, sweat a lot, feel lightheaded or faint, or have a fast heart rate or palpitations. If you have symptoms like these, you need to see a doctor right away, especially if they are sudden and severe. In most cases, pulmonary embolism is caused by a blood clot in the leg that breaks loose and travels to the lungs. A blood clot in a vein close to the skin is not likely to cause problems. But having blood clots in deep veins (deep vein thrombosis) can lead to pulmonary embolism. More than 300,000 people each year have deep vein thrombosis or a pulmonary embolism.1 Other things can block an artery, such as tumors, air bubbles, amniotic fluid, or fat that is released into the blood vessels when a bone is broken. Anything that makes you more likely to form blood clots increases your risk of pulmonary embolism. Some people are born with blood that clots too quickly. Other things that can increase your risk include: Being inactive for long periods. This can happen when you have to stay in bed after surgery or a serious illness, or when you sit for a long time on a flight or car trip. Recent surgery that involved the legs, hips, belly, or brain. Some diseases, such as cancer, heart failure, stroke, or a severe infection. You are also at higher risk for blood clots if you are an older adult (especially older than 70) or extremely overweight (obese). It may be hard to diagnose pulmonary embolism, because the symptoms are like those of many other problems, such as a heart attack, a panic attack, or pneumonia. Based on your risk, you might have tests to look for blood clots or rule out other causes of your symptoms. They are often called blood thinners, but they don't really thin the blood. Most people take a blood thinner for a few months. People at high risk for blood clots may need it for the rest of their lives. These medicines can dissolve clots quickly, but they increase the risk of serious bleeding. Another option is surgery or a minimally invasive procedure to remove the clot (embolectomy). Some people can't take blood thinners, or they form clots in spite of taking the medicine. To prevent future problems, they may have a filter put into the large vein (vena cava) that carries blood from the lower body to the heart. A vena cava filter helps keep blood clots from reaching the lungs. Blood thinners can help reduce your risk, but they increase your risk of bleeding. You can reduce your risk of pulmonary embolism by doing things that help prevent blood clots in your legs. When you travel, drink extra fluids.

Much like other forms of liver disease, PBC permanently damages the liver as tissue is replaced with scar tissue (fibrosis). As more scar tissue develops, the structure and function of the liver are affected. But it may be related to a problem with the immune system, which is the body's natural defense system. When symptoms do occur, they may include: Itching (pruritus). Yellowing of the skin and the white part of the eyes (jaundice). With more advanced liver damage, people may have complications related to cholangitis such as: Fluid buildup in the abdomen (ascites). Bleeding of enlarged veins in the esophagus, stomach, and rectum (variceal bleeding). Primary biliary cholangitis is suspected based on a medical history, physical exam, and lab tests that show high levels of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase and antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) in the blood. Your doctor may also conduct an imaging test such as an ultrasound, which shows images of the liver and other tissues inside the body. Treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis is difficult, because the immune system appears to be involved. As with other forms of cirrhosis, treatment focuses on reducing symptoms, preventing and treating the complications of the disease, and preventing other conditions that may cause additional liver damage. Two medicines, ursodiol (UDCA) and ocaliva, can be used to treat PBC. And Ocaliva decreases the amount of bile acids made by the liver. If you have fatigue, your doctor will try to find the cause of your tiredness. The best way to help dry eyes is to use eye drops (artificial tears) when your eyes feel dry. Because people with PBC have a high risk of getting osteoporosis, you should have periodic bone density scans.

Or maybe you have already tried to quit a few times. You probably already know that smoking is bad for your health and that quitting will reduce your risk of getting a disease related to smoking, such as heart or lung disease. If you continue to smoke, there is a 1 out of 2 chance that you will die earlier because of smoking. Smokers, on average, die 13 to 14 years sooner than people like them who are not smokers.4 If you quit, most of your risk for having a heart attack or getting cancer goes away. Quitting can cut your risk of heart attack in half within 2 years. After you quit, your risk for developing cancers of the voice box (larynx), mouth, throat, esophagus, intestines, bladder, kidney, and pancreas gradually declines. In addition to reducing your risk of diseases in the future, you will notice some benefits right away after you stop smoking. Your shortness of breath, energy, and asthma symptoms will likely get better within the first 2 to 4 weeks after you quit. There are other benefits to quitting: You will reduce the health risks for your family members caused by secondhand smoke when you quit smoking. If your teen already smokes, he or she is more likely to quit smoking if you quit.5 Underweight babies and problem pregnancies are less likely in women who quit smoking. You can get cancers of the throat and mouth from using cigars, pipes, or chewing tobacco. Even if you think that you don't inhale the smoke from a pipe or cigar, you are at greater risk for disease. Using smokeless tobacco (\"chew\") or snuff (\"dip\" or \"rub\") gives you a higher risk of mouth cancer, gum disease, and tooth loss. Avoiding diseases caused by smoking and being in control of your life are good reasons for teens to quit. If you are a teen and you smoke, chew tobacco, or use snuff, you probably already know that tobacco is bad for you. If you are like most teens, you intend to quit at some point, but you may not feel it's very important to quit now. But the longer you use tobacco, the greater your risk for becoming addicted to it."], [418, "Puna", "Sometimes called \"mountain sickness,\" altitude sickness is a group of symptoms that can strike if you walk or climb to a higher elevation, or altitude, too quickly. If you live in a place that's located at a moderately high altitude, you get used to the air pressure. But if you travel to a place at a higher altitude than you're used to, your body will need time to adjust to the change in pressure. There are three kinds of altitude sickness: Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is the mildest form and it's very common. High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE) is a buildup of fluid in the lungs that can be very dangerous and even life threatening. High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE) is the most severe form of altitude sickness and happens when there's fluid in the brain. You might have: Headache Dizziness Nausea Vomiting Fatigue and loss of energy Shortness of breath Problems with sleep Less appetite Symptoms usually come on within 12 to 24 hours of reaching a higher elevation and then get better within a day or two as your body adjusts to the change in altitude. If you have a more moderate case of altitude sickness, your symptoms might feel more intense and not improve with over-the-counter medications. You may also have: Loss of coordination and trouble walking A severe headache that doesn't get better with medication A tightening in your chest If you develop a severe form of altitude sickness like HAPE or HACE, you might have: Confusion Shortness of breath even at rest Inability to walk A cough that produces a white or pink frothy substance Coma Anyone can develop altitude sickness, no matter how fit, young, or healthy they are -- even Olympic athletes can get it. Your chance of getting altitude sickness depends on a few other things: how quickly you move to a higher elevation, how high you go up, the altitude where you sleep, and other factors. Your risk also depends on where you live and the altitude there, your age (young people are more likely to get it), and whether you've had altitude sickness before. Having certain illnesses like diabetes or lung disease doesn't automatically make you more likely to develop altitude sickness. If you get a headache and at least one other symptom associated with altitude sickness within a day or two of changing your elevation, you might have altitude sickness. Your doctor might listen to your chest with a stethoscope or take an X-ray of your chest or an MRI or CT scan of your brain to look for fluid. If you have severe altitude sickness, you'll need to be taken down to a lower elevation right away -- and it must be lower than 4,000 feet. You'll have to see a doctor as soon as possible and you may need to go to the hospital. If you have HACE, you might need a steroid called dexamethasone. If you have HAPE, you will need supplemental oxygen and may need medications, as well as moving to a lower altitude. The best way you can lower your chance of getting altitude sickness is through acclimatization. If you have to fly or drive somewhere that's higher up, stop at one destination that's lower for at least a full day before going any higher.

If these items are not kept out of reach, your child could swallow, inhale, or eat these toxic substances or get them on his or her skin. Products that are poisonous to children can also harm pets. Use the following tips to keep dangerous products or items away from children. Use the lowest-risk form and the smallest amount of product needed. Never leave a poisonous product unattended, even for a moment. Many poisonings occur when an adult becomes distracted by the doorbell, a telephone, or some other interruption. And be careful of what you store in your bedside table and other cupboards that are lower than your shoulder height. Never store poisonous products in food containers. Use \"Mr. Yuk\" stickers, and teach your children to recognize them. These stickers are available from your local poison control center or hospital.

Call your doctor if you have calluses or corns on your feet that need to be removed or if you have sores that are not healing. If you wear loose-fitting shoes because of foot problems, you can lose your balance and fall. If you tend to feel lightheaded when you stand up quickly, take the time to get up slowly from your bed or chair. When you wake up, it may help to sit up first and count slowly to 10 before you try to stand up. And after you stand up, stay still for a few seconds before you move. If you are very weak or dizzy, don't try to walk around. You may have a health problem that needs treatment, such as a blood pressure or inner ear problem. Or you may be having a side effect from a medicine that you take. Be sure you are drinking enough water, especially if the weather is hot. If you live alone, think about wearing an alert device that will bring help in case you fall and can't get up. Or carry a cordless or cell phone with you from room to room. Set up a plan to make contact once a day with a family member or friend. If you can get up alone, practice this often enough to feel comfortable. If you can't get up by yourself, see a physical therapist for help. Repair or replace worn heels and soles. If you use a walker or cane, make sure it is fitted to you.

Depending on the cause, primary ovarian insufficiency may develop as early as the teen years, or the problem may have been present from birth. A woman who has primary ovarian insufficiency is very likely to have irregular or no periods, infertility problems, and menopause-like symptoms. It is difficult, though not impossible, for women who have primary ovarian insufficiency to become pregnant. Although the exact cause of primary ovarian insufficiency may be unknown, a genetic factor or a problem with the body's immune system may play a role in some women. In an immune system disorder, the body may attack its own tissues-in this case, the ovaries. Primary ovarian insufficiency may develop after a hysterectomy or other pelvic surgery or from radiation or chemotherapy treatment for cancer. In some of these cases, the condition may be temporary, with the ovaries starting to work again some years later. The symptoms of primary ovarian insufficiency are similar to those of menopause. You also may have some or all of the symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes, night sweats, irritability, vaginal dryness, low sex drive, or trouble sleeping. If your periods become irregular or stop, your doctor will give you a physical exam and ask you questions about your general health and whether you have other symptoms of primary ovarian insufficiency. To check for possible ovarian failure, your blood level of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) will be checked. If the amount of FSH in your blood is higher than normal on more than one day, you may have primary ovarian insufficiency. Another blood test also may be done to measure the amount of estradiol (or estrogen) in your blood. Very low estrogen with a high FSH is a sign of primary ovarian insufficiency. Some women find out they have primary ovarian insufficiency when they see a doctor because they are having trouble getting pregnant. Your doctor may prescribe hormone therapy or other medicines to help with hot flashes. Some women with primary ovarian insufficiency may choose to try to become pregnant using donor eggs and in vitro fertilization.

Most cases of premature ejaculation do not have a clear cause. Premature ejaculation may occur with a new partner. It may happen only in certain sexual situations or if it has been a long time since the last ejaculation. Psychological factors such as anxiety, guilt, or depression can also cause it. In some cases, it may be related to a medical cause such as hormonal problems, injury, or a side effect of certain medicines. The main symptom is an uncontrolled ejaculation either before or shortly after intercourse begins. Ejaculation occurs before the person wishes it, with minimal sexual stimulation. Practicing relaxation techniques or using distraction methods may help you delay ejaculation. For some men, stopping or cutting down on the use of alcohol, tobacco, or illegal drugs may improve how well they can control ejaculation. For example, you may learn to identify and control the sensations that lead up to ejaculation. And you may learn to communicate with your partner to slow or stop stimulation. You can try using a condom to reduce sensation to the penis. Counseling or behavioral therapy may help reduce anxiety related to premature ejaculation. Antidepressant medicines are sometimes used to treat premature ejaculation. They are used because one of their side effects is inhibited orgasm, which helps delay ejaculation. Tramadol (Ultram) is a medicine that has been used for many years to control pain. There are also creams, gels, and a spray that may be used to treat premature ejaculation by reducing sensation.

Additional characteristic features include generalized atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease and stroke, hip dislocations, unusually prominent veins of the scalp, loss of the layer of fat beneath the skin (subcutaneous adipose tissue), defects of the nails, joint stiffness, skeletal defects, and/or other abnormalities. According to reports in the medical literature, individuals with HGPS develop premature, widespread thickening and loss of elasticity of artery walls (arteriosclerosis), which result in life-threatening complications during childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood. Children with progeria die of heart disease (atherosclerosis) at an average age of 13 years, with a range of about eight to 21 years. As with any person suffering from heart disease, the common events as heart disease advances for children with progeria can include high blood pressure, strokes, angina (chest pain due to poor blood flow to the heart itself), enlarged heart, and heart failure, all conditions associated with aging.

Not all high blood pressure is preeclampsia. In some women, blood pressure goes up very high in the second or third trimester. This is sometimes called gestational hypertension, and it can lead to preeclampsia. Preeclampsia can be dangerous for the mother and baby. It can keep the baby from getting enough blood and oxygen. Experts don't know the exact cause. Preeclampsia seems to start because the placenta doesn't grow the usual network of blood vessels deep in the wall of the uterus. This leads to poor blood flow in the placenta. You also have a higher chance of getting it if the mother of your baby's father had preeclampsia. Already having high blood pressure when you get pregnant raises your chance of getting preeclampsia. Mild preeclampsia usually doesn't cause symptoms. But preeclampsia can cause rapid weight gain and sudden swelling of the hands and face. Preeclampsia is usually found during a prenatal visit. This is one reason why it's so important to go to all of your prenatal visits. You need to have your blood pressure checked often. A sudden increase in blood pressure often is the first sign of a problem. You also will have a urine test to look for protein, another sign of preeclampsia. These signs of preeclampsia can occur before protein shows up in your urine. The only cure for preeclampsia is having the baby.

According to the American Lung Association, about a third of pregnant women with asthma will find their asthma symptoms improve during pregnancy, a third will have worse asthma, and a third will have stable disease symptoms. If you do not keep your asthma under control during your pregnancy, you may have less oxygen delivered to your blood. It is very important to keep your asthma under control during your pregnancy, because the developing fetus receives oxygen from the mother's blood. Having good control of asthma also improves the risk for pregnancy complications such as premature birth, low birth weight, and preeclampsia (dangerously high blood pressure during pregnancy). Several scientific studies have shown that if you do not control your asthma properly during pregnancy, you are much more likely to harm both yourself and your baby than if you use appropriate drugs to control your asthma. If you are using an asthma inhaler, studies of its safety during pregnancy have been reassuring. In addition, the risk for asthma attacks decreases and lung function is improved with treatment. The most appropriate thing to do is to talk to your doctor, who will look at how severe your asthma is and what treatment is appropriate for you while you're pregnant. Work with your asthma doctor to determine the right kind and quantity of asthma medication for you to take. Keep a diary of what triggers the worsening of your asthma and find ways to avoid those triggers. For some women, their asthma gets worse, for some it stays the same, and for some it improves. In general, if your asthma is severe, chances are it may become a little worse during your pregnancy. On the other hand, if you were pregnant before and your asthma did not get worse, chances are that it will not get worse during the next pregnancy. Asthma is almost never a reason to notget pregnant. However, if you have severe asthma, it is worth talking to your doctor before you get pregnant. The flu vaccine is recommended for pregnant women and people with asthma because they are among groups at high risk for severe flu complications, including death.

But you can help protect yourself by learning the symptoms of preeclampsia and by seeing your doctor for regular prenatal care. The exact causes of preeclampsia and eclampsia -- a result of a placenta that doesn't function properly -- are not known, although some researchers suspect poor nutrition or high body fat are possible causes.

Sudden weight gain over 1 or 2 days Abdominal pain, especially in the upper right side Severe headaches A decrease in urine Blurry vision, flashing lights, and floaters You can also have preeclampsia and not have any symptoms. Preeclampsia can prevent the placenta from receiving enough blood, which can cause your baby to be born very small. It is also one of the leading causes of premature births, and the complications that can follow, including learning disabilities, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, hearing and vision problems. In moms-to-be, preeclampsia can cause rare but serious complications that include: Stroke Seizure Water in the lungs Heart failure Reversible blindness Bleeding from the liver Bleeding after you've given birth Preeclampsia can also cause the placenta to suddenly separate from the uterus, which is called placental abruption. Your doctor will talk with you about when to deliver based on how far along your baby is, how well your baby is doing in your womb, and the severity of your preeclampsia. If your baby is not close to term, you and your doctor may be able to treat preeclampsia until your baby has developed enough to be safely delivered. If you have mild preeclampsia - also known as preclampsia with and without severe features, your doctor may prescribe: Bed rest either at home or in the hospital; you'll be asked to rest mostly on your left side. Careful observation with a fetal heart rate monitor and frequent ultrasounds Medicines to lower your blood pressure Blood and urine tests Your doctor also may recommend that you stay in the hospital for closer monitoring. In the hospital you may be given: Medicine to help prevent seizures, lower your blood pressure, and prevent other problems Steroid injections to help your baby's lungs develop more quickly Other treatments include: Magnesium can be injected into the veins to prevent eclampsia-related seizures Hydralazine or another antihypertensive drug to manage severe blood pressure elevations Monitoring fluid intake and urine output For severe preeclampsia, your doctor may need to deliver your baby right away, even if you're not close to term. After delivery, signs and symptoms of preeclampsia should go away within 1 to 6 weeks."], [437, "Prediabetes", "But it's almost always present before you get type 2 diabetes. It means your blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not yet high enough for you to be diagnosed with the disease. About 86 million people in the U.S. over age 20 have prediabetes. These range from type 2 diabetes to problems with your heart, blood vessels, eyes, and kidneys. By the time you're diagnosed with diabetes, many of these problems have already taken hold. You're most likely to get this disease if you: Have a family history of type 2 diabetes Had gestational diabetes or gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds Have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) Are African-American, Native American, Latino, or Pacific Islander Are overweight or obese, especially around the middle (belly fat) Have high cholesterol, high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and a high LDL cholesterol Don't exercise Are older; people over age 45 are most likely to get it. You should get tested for prediabetes if you meet the criteria above and you: Had an abnormal blood sugar reading in the past Have heart disease Show signs of insulin resistance, which means your body produces insulin, but doesn't respond to it like it should Although most people with prediabetes have no symptoms, you might notice you're extra thirsty, pee a lot more, or have blurred vision or extreme fatigue. Your doctor can perform one of three different blood tests -- the fasting plasma glucose test, the oral glucose tolerance test, or the hemoglobin A1c test. If your blood sugar level is higher than normal after the test, you may have prediabetes. The oral glucose tolerance test records your blood sugar after a fast and then again 2 hours after you have a very sweet drink. If your blood sugar is higher than normal 2 hours after the test, you may have prediabetes. Try to get at least 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week.

Precocious puberty (PP) is a statistical definition; that is, it is the onset of secondary sexual characteristics in children at an age that is two standard deviations younger than the mean age of pubertal onset. The actual age that defines sexual precocity is therefore dependent on the epidemiological data that one uses to define the average age of pubertal onset. Classically, in North America, puberty is considered precocious if it begins before age 8 in girls or age 9 in boys. Recently, most likely because of increasing weight in the population, puberty appears to be having an earlier age of onset."], [439, "Precancerous Dermatosis", "Bowen disease is a rare skin disorder. Bowen disease only affects the outermost layer of the skin (epidermis). Bowen disease is considered a pre-cancerous condition, although the risk of developing skin cancer is less than 10 percent. The exact cause of Bowen disease is unknown, although there are identified risk factors such as chronic sun exposure. Bowen disease is also known as squamous cell carcinoma in situ, and is generally considered an early, noninvasive form of intraepidermal squamous cell carcinoma. Intraepidermal means that the disease occurs inside the epidermal layer of the skin."], [440, "Pressure Sores", "You may know pressure sores by their more common name: bed sores. They happen when you lie or sit in one position too long and the weight of your body against the surface of the bed or chair cuts off blood supply. Your doctor may talk about the \"stage\" of your pressure sores. The stages are based on how deep the sores are, which can affect their treatment. You'll know they're better when the sore gets smaller and pink tissue shows up along the sides. These pressure sores only affect the upper layer of your skin. Symptoms: Pain, burning, or itching are common symptoms. If you have darker skin, the discolored area may be harder to see. The spot doesn't get lighter when you press on it, or even 10 to 30 minutes after you stop pressing. What to do: The first and most important thing to do with any pressure sore is to stop the pressure. If you spend a lot of time in bed, try to move at least once every 2 hours. Wash the sore with mild soap and water and dry it gently. Recovery time: A Stage 1 pressure sore may go away in as little as 2 or 3 days. This happens when the sore digs deeper below the surface of your skin. This may hurt, so ask your doctor if you should take a pain reliever 30 to 60 minutes before cleaning. If you see signs of an infection (such as pus, fever, or redness), tell your doctor. Recovery time: A Stage 2 pressure sore should get better in 3 days to 3 weeks. These sores have gone through the second layer of skin into the fat tissue. Symptoms: The sore looks like a crater and may have a bad odor. It may show signs of infection: red edges, pus, odor, heat, and/or drainage. The tissue in or around the sore is black if it has died. What to do: Stage 3 sores will need more care. You may also be able to get a special bed or mattress through your insurance. Recovery time: A Stage 3 pressure sore will take at least one month, and up to 4 months, to heal. You may be able to see tendons, muscles, and bone. What to do: Tell your doctor right away. Recovery time: A Stage 3 pressure sore could take anywhere from 3 months or much longer, even years, to heal. In addition to the 4 main stages for bed sores, there are 2 others: \"Unstageable\" is when you can't see the bottom of the sore, so you don't know how deep it is. \"Suspected Deep Tissue Injury\" (SDTI). This is when the surface of the skin looks like a Stage 1 or 2 sore, but underneath the surface it's a Stage 3 or 4."], [441, "PRCA", "Acquired Pure Red Cell Aplasia is a rare bone marrow disorder characterized by an isolated decline of red blood cells (erythrocytes) produced by the bone marrow. It is also believed that Acquired Pure Red Cell Aplasia may occur secondary to a tumor of the thymus gland (thyoma), viral infections, or certain drugs."], [442, "Prayer", "Many people believe prayer is a way to communicate directly with a spiritual energy or higher being. Prayer can be silent, as in meditation, or spoken aloud in a group, as in a religious setting. Prayer may help people find an inner sense of meaning, or it may strengthen their belief in a higher being. Many established religions view prayer as a powerful tool in helping a wide range of physical or mental problems. You can use prayer for a positive outcome in a situation or for inner strength during difficult times in life. Health benefits, such as lower blood pressure, increased longevity, and reduced risk for depression, may occur in people who regularly practice their spiritual faith or who are part of a religious community. Some people, depending on their belief in prayer, may experience a feeling of inner strength or power when they engage in prayer. Other studies are inconclusive.1 When combined with conventional medical treatment, prayer is not thought to have any negative side effects or complications."], [443, "PPS (Post-Polio Syndrome)", "Post-polio syndrome is an illness of the nervous system that can appear 15 to 50 years after you had polio. It affects your muscles and nerves, and it causes you to have weakness, fatigue, and muscle or joint pain. Although post-polio syndrome can make some day-to-day activities more difficult, treatment can help control symptoms and help you stay active. Your symptoms may not get worse for many years. The polio virus harms the nerves that control muscles, and it makes the muscles weak. But the nerves that connect to the muscles could be damaged without your knowing it. The nerves may break down over time and cause you to have weak muscles again. This is most common in the muscles that had nerve damage from polio. You may find that the activities you used to do without getting tired are now causing fatigue. You may often feel tired, have a heavy feeling in your muscles, or feel sleepy. Muscles affected by polio tend to be weaker than normal. To make up for this weakness, other muscles have to work harder. This puts extra wear and tear on muscles, joints, and tendons, sometimes leading to aches, cramping, and pain. Depending on which muscles are affected, this trio of muscle weakness, fatigue, and pain can make daily activities more difficult. Or they may need help to improve their breathing. Doctors diagnose post-polio syndrome based on your symptoms, medical history, and lab tests. Lab tests will be done to check for other causes of your symptoms. If your symptoms and history point to post-polio syndrome, and if tests cannot find another cause, then your doctor may diagnose post-polio syndrome. You may need to have more tests or exams if your symptoms change. Post-polio syndrome is a condition that you may have for the rest of your life. The goal of treatment is to help you control symptoms and learn ways to stay active in spite of your muscle weakness. Here are some things you can do to stay active and feel better: Get enough exercise, and get enough rest. Work with your doctor or a physical therapist to plan an exercise program that will help strengthen your muscles without making your pain and fatigue worse. Try to adjust your daily schedule so that your routine is less tiring, and make time for rest periods or naps. Use ice, heat, and physical therapies like massage. Try medicines for pain, fatigue, and sleep problems. Use assistive devices to make activities easier. An occupational therapist can help you find what devices might be most helpful, such as a cane, different types of braces or splints, or a powered chair. If your condition gets worse, your treatment needs may increase. Be sure to see your doctor whenever new symptoms occur or your symptoms get worse. But it may be hard to recognize, because symptoms of fatigue, low energy, and sleep problems can occur with both conditions. It's hard to predict who will get symptoms, when symptoms will begin, and how severe they will be. You are more likely to get post-polio syndrome if you: Had polio when you were a teen or an adult, rather than as a child. Had serious muscle weakness or breathing problems when you had polio. The more fully a person recovered from the polio, the more likely it is that he or she will get post-polio syndrome. The symptoms (such as fatigue and weakness) are sometimes ignored or considered part of \"normal aging.\""], [444, "PPH", "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, progressive disorder characterized by high blood pressure (hypertension) of the main artery of the lungs (pulmonary artery) for no apparent reason. Symptoms of PAH include shortness of breath (dyspnea) especially during exercise, chest pain, and fainting episodes. The exact cause of PAH is unknown and although treatable, there is no known cure for the disease. Individuals with PAH may go years without a diagnosis, either because their symptoms are mild, nonspecific, or only present during demanding exercise. However, it is important to treat PAH because without treatment high blood pressure causes the heart to work much harder, and over time, these muscles may weaken or fail. The progressive nature of this disease means that an individual may experience only mild symptoms at first, but will eventually require treatment and medical care to maintain a normal lifestyle. People with heritable PAH have eitehr: (1) an autosomal dominant genetic condition associated with mutations in the BMPR2 gene or another gene in the TGFbeta pathway now associated with HPAH, or (2) are members of a family in which PAH is known to occur as primary disease. The first reported case of PAH occurred in 1891, when the German doctor E. Romberg published a description of a patient who, at autopsy, showed thickening of the pulmonary artery but no heart or lung disease that might have caused the condition."], [445, "Potassium (K)", "Potassium is a mineral that's crucial for life. Potassium is necessary for the heart, kidneys, and other organs to work normally. Most people who eat a healthy diet should get enough potassium naturally. Low potassium is associated with a risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, cancer, digestive disorders, and infertility. For people with low potassium, doctors sometimes recommend improved diets -- or potassium supplements -- to prevent or treat some of these conditions. Potassium deficiencies are more common in people who: Use certain medicines, such as diuretics Have physically demanding jobs Athletes exercising in hot climates and sweating excessively Have health conditions that affect their digestive absorption, such as Crohn's disease Have an eating disorder Smoke Abuse alcohol or drugs The Institute of Medicine has set an adequate intake for potassium. Getting this amount of potassium from diet, with or without supplements, should be enough to keep you healthy. The FDA has determined that foods that contain at least 350 milligrams of potassium can bear the following label: \"Diets containing foods that are good sources of potassium and low in sodium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure and stroke.\" There is no set upper limit for potassium. Good natural food sources of potassium include: Bananas Avocados Nuts, like almonds and peanuts Citrus fruits Leafy, green vegetables Milk Potatoes Keep in mind that some types of cooking, such as boiling, can decrease the potassium content in some foods. People with kidney disease, diabetes, heart disease, Addison's disease, stomach ulcers, or other health problems should never take potassium supplements without talking to a doctor first. Signs of a potassium overdose include muscle weakness or paralysis, irregular heartbeat, confusion, tingling sensation in the limbs, low blood pressure, and coma. Other common side effects are: muscle weakness or paralysis, cardiac conduction abnormalities, and cardiac arrhythmias, including sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, slow idioventricular rhythms, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and asystole."], [446, "Postural Tremor", "Many people with multiple sclerosis (MS) have some form of tremor, or shaking they can't control, in different parts of their bodies. There are several types: Postural tremors. This is the most common form of MS tremor, and it usually causes the most problems in day-to-day life. Tremors happen because of damage to nerves that control body movement. These problems are one of the hardest MS symptoms to treat. Drugs don't work well for everyone with tremors. Some people have found relief from medicines for other conditions, such as: Acetazolamide (Diamox), which treats a type of glaucoma and altitude sickness Anti-anxiety drugs buspirone (Buspar) and clonazepam (Klonopin) The antihistamine hydroxyzine (Atarax, Vistaril) Isoniazid (INH), a drug for tuberculosis Primidone (Mysoline), a seizure medicine Propranolol (Inderal), which treats heart problems, high blood pressure, and migraines Tremors can be tough to handle in social situations. A psychologist or counselor can help you find ways to feel more comfortable in public and keep the tremors from changing how you live your life."], [447, "Postural", "By the end of a pregnancy, a fetus is typically positioned head-down (vertex), ready to pass head first through the birth canal. Postural management is a way of attempting to turn a fetus from a breech to a vertex position by lying or sitting in a certain position several times a day. Postural management is controversial, because it has not been proved effective for turning a breech fetus into a head-down position. Postural management is generally considered a safe practice for pregnant women. But be sure to consult a doctor before trying any of these methods, especially when being treated for a medical condition, such as high blood pressure. Postural management methods that use gravity to try to turn the baby's head down toward the cervix include: Propping up your hips by lying back on a firm surface with your feet on the floor and your knees bent. (30.5 cm) using large pillows (such as couch cushions) placed under your lower back and buttocks. One end of a wide board (such as a full-size ironing board) is propped up about 12 in.

People with PTSD have symptoms for longer than one month and cannot function as well as before the event occurred. Symptoms of PTSD most often begin within three months of the event. Symptoms of PTSD often are grouped into four main categories, including: Reliving: People with PTSD repeatedly relive the ordeal through thoughts and memories of the trauma. They also may feel great distress when certain things remind them of the trauma, such as the anniversary date of the event. This can lead to feelings of detachment and isolation from family and friends, as well as a loss of interest in activities that the person once enjoyed. Increased arousal: These include excessive emotions; problems relating to others, including feeling or showing affection; difficulty falling or staying asleep; irritability; outbursts of anger; difficulty concentrating; and being \"jumpy\" or easily startled. The person may also suffer physical symptoms, such as increased blood pressure and heart rate, rapid breathing, muscle tension, nausea, and diarrhea. Negative Cognitions and Mood: This refers to thoughts and feelings related to blame, estrangement, and memories of the traumatic event. Young children with PTSD may suffer from delayed development in areas such as toilet training, motor skills, and language. Further, the type of help and support a person receives from friends, family members and professionals following the trauma may influence the development of PTSD or the severity of symptoms. PTSD was first brought to the attention of the medical community by war veterans; hence the names shell shock and battle fatigue syndrome. Victims of trauma related to physical and sexual assault face the greatest risk for PTSD. About 3.6% of adult Americans -- about 5.2 million people -- suffer from PTSD during the course of a year, and an estimated 7.8 million Americans will experience PTSD at some point in their lives. If symptoms of PTSD are present, the doctor will begin an evaluation by performing a complete medical history and physical exam. Although there are no lab tests to specifically diagnose PTSD, the doctor may use various tests to rule out physical illness as the cause of the symptoms. The doctor bases his or her diagnosis of PTSD on reported symptoms, including any problems with functioning caused by the symptoms. The goal of PTSD treatment is to reduce the emotional and physical symptoms, to improve daily functioning, and to help the person better cope with the event that triggered the disorder. Treatment for PTSD may involve psychotherapy (a type of counseling), medication, or both. Medication Doctors use antidepressant medications to treat PTSD -- and to control the feelings of anxiety and its associated symptoms -- including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as Paxil, Celexa, Luvox, Prozac, and Zoloft; and tricyclic antidepressants such as Elavil and Doxepin. Tranquilizers such as Ativan and Klonopin; mood stabilizers such as Depakote and Lamictal; and neuroleptics such as Seroquel and Abilify are sometimes used. Certain blood pressure medicines are also sometimes used to control particular symptoms. For example prazosin may be used for nightmares, or propranolol may be used to help minimize the formation of traumatic memories. Psychotherapy Psychotherapy for PTSD involves helping the person learn skills to manage symptoms and develop ways of coping. Therapy also aims to teach the person and his or her family about the disorder, and help the person work through the fears associated with the traumatic event. A variety of psychotherapy approaches are used to treat people with PTSD, including: Cognitive behavioral therapy, which involves learning to recognize and change thought patterns that lead to troublesome emotions, feelings, and behavior. Exposure therapy, a type of cognitive behavioral therapy that involves having the person re-live the traumatic experience, or exposing the person to objects or situations that cause anxiety. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a complex form of psychotherapy that was initially designed to alleviate distress associated with traumatic memories and is now also used to treat phobias. Symptoms of PTSD seldom disappear completely, but treatment can help sufferers learn to cope more effectively. Treatment can lead to fewer and less intense symptoms, as well as a greater ability to cope by managing feelings related to the trauma. Some studies suggest that early intervention with people who have suffered a trauma may reduce some of the symptoms of PTSD or prevent it all together."], [449, "Postcoital Test", "If you and your partner are trying to have a baby but haven't been able to, you may start to wonder if you should get fertility tests. Experts say it's time to check with a doctor if you've had regular sex without birth control for 12 months if you are under the age of 35 and for 6 months if you are over 35. When you see your doctor, he'll probably start by asking questions about your health and lifestyle. He'll want to know things about you and your partner like: Medical history, including any long-term conditions or surgeries Medicines you take Whether you smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, eat or drink things with caffeine, or use illicit drugs If you had contact with chemicals, toxins, or radiation at home or work He'll also want to know about your sex life, such as: How often you have sex Your history of birth control use If you've had sexually transmitted diseases Any problems having sex Whether either of you had sex outside the relationship Your doctor will also have questions about things connected with your periods, such as: Have you been pregnant before? Did you have any changes in blood flow or the appearance of large blood clots? Have you ever seen a doctor for infertility, and did you get any treatment? Doctors use a variety of ways to identify any problems that might help cause fertility trouble. It can detect cervical cancer, other problems with the cervix, or sexually transmitted diseases. To get pregnant, you need to release an egg each month -- called \"ovulation.\" Your doctor may ask you to take a urine test at home for luteinizing hormone, or LH. Your doctor also may check levels of the hormone progesterone in your blood. By checking it each morning, you'll learn your pattern of ovulation over several months. Your doctor may also run tests on your thyroid, or check for other hormonal problems, to rule out conditions that might cause missed or irregular ovulation. Before you can get pregnant, your uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries all need to work right. Your doctor may suggest different procedures that can check the health of these organs: Hysterosalpingogram (HSG). Also called a \"tubogram,\" this is a series of X-rays of your fallopian tubes and uterus. The HSG can help you learn if your fallopian tubes are blocked or if you have any defects of your uterus. Using sound waves, he'll be able to see images of the ovaries and uterus to check for problems there. Your doctor puts a thin, flexible tube -- with a camera on the end -- through the cervix and into the uterus. He can see problems there and take tissue samples if needed. Your doctor makes small cuts in your belly and inserts tools, including a camera. This surgery can check your entire pelvis and potentially correct problems, such as endometriosis, a disease that affects the uterus. You may get a blood test to check your levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, or FSH, which triggers your ovaries to prepare an egg for release each month. You take a pill of clomiphene citrate on the fifth through ninth days of your menstrual cycle. FSH gets checked on day 3 (before you take the medicine) and on day 10 (after). High FSH levels suggest you have lower chances of getting pregnant. Your doctor may also suggest a blood test to check for a hormone called inhibin B. Levels may be lower in women with fertility problems, but experts are divided about whether the test can predict infertility. In this procedure, he takes a sample of tissue from the lining of your uterus. After the testing is done, about 85% of couples will have some idea about why they're having trouble getting pregnant."], [450, "Positron Emission Tomography (PET)", "Positron emission tomography (PET) is a test that uses a special type of camera and a tracer (radioactive chemical) to look at organs in the body. The tracer usually is a special form of a substance (such as glucose) that collects in cells that are using a lot of energy, such as cancer cells. During the test, the tracer liquid is put into a vein (intravenous, or IV) in your arm. The tracer gives off tiny positively charged particles (positrons). The camera records the positrons and turns the recording into pictures on a computer. PET scan pictures do not show as much detail as computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) because the pictures show only the location of the tracer. The PET picture may be matched with those from a CT scan to get more detailed information about where the tracer is located. A PET scan is often used to evaluate cancer, check blood flow, or see how organs are working. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan is done to: Study the brain's blood flow and metabolic activity. A PET scan can help a doctor find nervous system problems, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, transient ischemic attack (TIA), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, stroke, and schizophrenia. Evaluate some cancers, especially lymphoma or cancers of the head and neck, brain, lung, colon, or prostate. In its early stages, cancer may show up more clearly on a PET scan than on a CT scan or an MRI. See how advanced a cancer is and whether it has spread to another area of the body (metastasized). It is often necessary to do both CT and PET scans to evaluate cancer. Help a doctor choose the best treatment for cancer or to see how well treatment is working. PET scans may also be done to see whether surgery can be done to remove a tumor. Help diagnose Alzheimer's disease when the symptoms are not clear or when a person has dementia symptoms at a young age (usually younger than 65).1 This is called amyloid imaging. Find poor blood flow to the heart, which may mean coronary artery disease. Help choose the best treatment, such as coronary artery bypass graft surgery, for a person with heart disease. Before you have a PET scan, tell your doctor if:You have diabetes. Talk with your doctor about how much medicine you should take.You take any medicines, supplements, or herbal remedies. During this time, you can give your baby breast milk you stored before the test, or you can give formula. During this time, you can give your baby breast milk you stored before the test, or you can give formula. Talk to your doctor about any concerns you have regarding the need for the test, its risks, how it will be done or what the results mean. To help you understand the importance of this test, fill out the medical test information form(What is a PDF document?). A positron emission tomography (PET) scan is done in a hospital nuclear medicine department or at a special PET center by a radiologist or nuclear medicine specialist and a technologist. The radioactive tracer is usually given in a vein (IV). The PET scanner, which is shaped like a doughnut, moves around you. The scanned pictures are sent to a computer screen so your doctor can see them. Many scans are done to make a series of pictures. At some medical centers, a CT scan will be done at the same time. You may be asked to read, name letters, or tell a story, depending on whether speech, reasoning, or memory is being tested. During the scan, you may be given earplugs and a blindfold (if you do not need to read during the test) to wear for your comfort. If you are having a PET scan of your heart, electrodes for an electrocardiogram (EKG, ECG) will be put on your body. The technologist will watch you through a window and you will be able talk to him or her through a two-way intercom at all times. After the test, drink lots of fluids for the next 24 hours to help flush the tracer out of your body. You may feel nervous inside the PET scanner. There is always a slight chance of damage to cells or tissue from radiation, including the low levels of radiation used for this test. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a test that uses a special type of camera and a tracer (radioactive chemical) to look at organs in the body. The radiologist may discuss preliminary results of the PET scan with you right after the test. This may mean coronary artery disease (CAD) is present. Decreased blood flow and glucose metabolism may mean that heart tissue is scarred and damaged, such as from a heart attack. Decreased oxygen use and blood flow may mean a stroke has occurred. Dementia may be caused by Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, or mental illness, such as schizophrenia. Patterns of blood flow and oxygen use that are not normal may mean a brain tumor is present. A special test (called amyloid imaging) may show signs of Alzheimer's disease. A PET scan is not usually done during pregnancy because the radiation could harm the unborn baby (fetus). Having recently had surgery, a biopsy, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. A CT scan and PET scan may be done at the same time. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging is a method that may be used to diagnose a person with symptoms of heart disease. SPECT imaging also may be done to see if a person with coronary artery disease (CAD) is likely to have a heart attack or other serious problem.2 Johnson KA, et al.

People with the condition usually aren't aware that they have it until a doctor or counselor tells them. If they do happen to notice symptoms, like not being able to think straight, they might chalk it up to things like stress or being tired. If you're concerned that you or someone you know is showing signs of schizophrenia, talk to a doctor or counselor. The changes you see are \"add-ons\" to normal behavior. Doctors may call these \"positive\" symptoms, but that doesn't mean that they're good. They might hear, see, smell, or feel things no one else does. These might tell them what to do, warn them of danger, or say mean things to them. The voices might talk to each other. They might believe they're someone else, like a famous actor or the president, or that they have superpowers. People with schizophrenia can have a hard time organizing their thoughts. They might not be able to follow along when you talk to them. Instead, it might seem like they're zoning out or distracted. When they talk, their words can come out jumbled and not make sense. For example, someone might lose track of what's going on in a TV show as they're watching. But sometimes they might be perfectly still for hours at a stretch, which experts call being catatonic. Contrary to popular belief, people with the disease usually aren't violent. Someone with schizophrenia may lose interest in some things or not be able to do them anymore. One common example is a lack of interest in grooming and hygiene. These symptoms can be hard to spot, especially in teens, because even healthy teens can have big emotional swings between highs and lows. A person with schizophrenia might seem like they have a terrible case of the blahs. They might not talk much or show any feelings. And when they talk, their voice can sound flat, like they have no emotions. Talking with them can feel like pulling teeth: If you want an answer, you have to really work to pry it out of them. They may stop bathing or taking care of themselves. Sometimes they can't get started at all. Someone with schizophrenia might have a hard time with their working memory. For example, they may not be able to keep track of different kinds of facts at the same time, like a phone number plus instructions. Along with having trouble paying attention, it can be hard for them to organize their thoughts and make decisions."], [452, "Porcelain Inlay", "To treat a cavity your dentist will remove the decayed portion of the tooth and then \"fill\" the area on the tooth where the decayed material was removed.

First, the dentist will use a local anesthetic to numb the area around the tooth to be filled. If the decay is near the root, your dentist may first put in a liner made of glass ionomer, composite resin, or other material to protect the nerve. When the multilayering process is completed, the dentist will shape the composite material to the desired result, trim off any excess material, and polish the final restoration. Teeth can be filled with gold; porcelain; silver amalgam (which consists of mercury mixed with silver, tin, zinc, and copper); or tooth-colored, plastic, and materials called composite resin fillings. This material is used in ways similar to the use of composite resin fillings. The location and extent of the decay, cost of filling material, your insurance coverage, and your dentist's recommendation assist in determining the type of filling best for you. Advantages of cast gold fillings: Durability -- lasts at least 10 to 15 years and usually longer; doesn't corrode Strength -- can withstand chewing forces Aesthetics -- some patients find gold more pleasing to the eye than silver amalgam fillings. Disadvantages of cast gold fillings: Expense -- gold cast fillings cost more than other materials; up to 10 times higher than cost of silver amalgam filings. Additional office visits -- requires at least two office visits to place Galvanic shock -- a gold filling placed immediately next to a silver amalgam filling may cause a sharp pain (galvanic shock) to occur. Aesthetics -- most patients dislike metal \"colored\" fillings and prefer fillings that match the rest of the tooth. Advantages of silver fillings: Durability -- silver fillings last at least 10 to 15 years and usually outlasts composite (tooth-colored) fillings. Strength -- can withstand chewing forces Expense -- may be less expensive than composite fillings Disadvantages of silver fillings: Poor aesthetics -- silver fillings don't match the color of natural teeth. Destruction of more tooth structure -- healthy parts of the tooth must often be removed to make a space large enough to hold the amalgam filling. Discoloration -- amalgam fillings can create a grayish hue to the surrounding tooth structure. Cracks and fractures -- although all teeth expand and contract in the presence of hot and cold liquids, which ultimately can cause the tooth to crack or fracture, amalgam material -- in comparison with other filling materials -- may experience a wider degree of expansion and contraction and lead to a higher incidence of cracks and fractures. Allergic reactions -- a small percentage of people, approximately 1%, are allergic to the mercury present in amalgam restorations. Advantages of composites: Aesthetics -- the shade/color of the composite fillings can be closely matched to the color of existing teeth. Bonding to tooth structure -- composite fillings actually chemically bond to tooth structure, providing further support. Versatility -- in addition to use as a filling material for decay, composite fillings can also be used to repair chipped, broken, or worn teeth. Tooth-sparing preparation -- sometimes less tooth structure needs to be removed compared with amalgam fillings when removing decay and preparing for the filling. Disadvantages of composites: Lack of durability -- composite fillings wear out sooner than amalgam fillings (lasting at least five years compared with at least 10 to 15 for amalgams); in addition, they may not last as long as amalgam fillings under the pressure of chewing and particularly if used for large cavities. Increased chair time -- because of the process to apply the composite material, these fillings can take up to 20 minutes longer than amalgam fillings to place. Additional visits -- if composites are used for inlays or onlays, more than one office visit may be required. Expense -- composite fillings can cost up to twice the cost of amalgam fillings. These fillings are made most often of porcelain, are more resistant to staining than composite resin material but are also more abrasive. This material generally lasts more than 15 years and can cost as much as gold. This material is most commonly used for fillings below the gum line and for fillings in young children (drilling is still required). However, this material is weaker than composite resin and is more susceptible to wear and prone to fracture. Most dental insurance plans cover the cost of the composite fillings up to the price of the silver filling, then the patient may have to pay the difference. Indirect fillings are similar to composite or tooth-colored fillings except they are made in a dental laboratory and require two visits before being placed. Indirect fillings are considered when not enough tooth structure remains to support a filling but the tooth is not so severely damaged that it needs a crown. The impression is sent to a dental lab that will make the indirect filling. A temporary filling (described below) is placed to protect the tooth while the restoration is being made. During the second visit, the temporary filling is removed, and the dentist will check the fit of the indirect restoration. Inlays are similar to fillings but the entire work lies within the cusps (bumps) on the chewing surface of the tooth. Inlays and onlays are more durable and last much longer than traditional fillings -- up to 30 years. Inlays and onlays weaken the tooth structure, but do so to a much lower extent than traditional fillings. Another type of inlay and onlay -- direct inlays and onlays -- follow similar processes and procedures as the indirect, but the difference is that direct inlays and onlays are made in the dental office and can be placed in one visit. Temporary fillings are used under the following circumstances: For fillings that require more than one appointment -- for example, before placement of gold fillings and for certain filling procedures (called indirect fillings) that use composite materials Following a root canal To allow a tooth's nerve to \"settle down\" if the pulp became irritated If emergency dental treatment is needed (such as to address a toothache) Temporary fillings are just that; they are not meant to last. Because these fillings contain the toxic substance mercury, some people think they are responsible for causing a number of diseases, including autism, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. The American Dental Association (ADA), the FDA, and numerous public health agencies say there's no proof that dental fillings cause harm to consumers. Additionally, there is no solid, scientific evidence to back up the claim that if a person has amalgam fillings removed, he or she will be cured of these or any other diseases. Although amalgams do contain mercury, when they are mixed with other metals, such as silver, copper, tin, and zinc, they form a stable alloy that dentists have used for more than 100 years to fill and preserve hundreds of millions of decayed teeth. \"Pregnant women and persons who may have a health condition that makes them more sensitive to mercury exposure, including individuals with existing high levels of mercury bioburden, should not avoid seeking dental care, but should discuss options with their health practitioner,\" according to the FDA. To maintain fillings, you should follow good oral hygiene -- visiting your dentist regularly for cleanings, brushing with a fluoride toothpaste, flossing and using an antibacterial mouthwash at least once daily. If your dentist suspects that a filling might be cracked or is \"leaking\" (when the sides of the filling don't fit tightly against the tooth, this allows debris and saliva to seep down between the filling and the tooth, which can lead to decay), he or she will take X-rays to assess the situation. If your tooth is extremely sensitive, if you feel a sharp edge, if you notice a crack in the filling, or if a piece of the filling is missing, call your dentist for an appointment. Tooth Pain and Sensitivity Tooth sensitivity following placement of a filling is fairly common. He or she may recommend a desensitizing toothpaste, may apply a desensitizing agent to the tooth, or possibly suggest a root canal procedure. If you experience pain when your teeth touch, the pain is likely caused by the touching of two different metal surfaces (for example, the silver amalgam in a newly filled tooth and a gold crown on another tooth with which it touches). If the decay was very deep or close to the pulp of the tooth, you may experience a \"toothache-type\" pain. Sometimes people experience what is known as referred pain -- pain or sensitivity in other teeth besides the one that received the filling. The filled tooth is simply passing along \"pain signals\" it's receiving to other teeth. In these rare circumstances, mercury or one of the metals used in an amalgam restoration is thought to trigger the allergic response. Although you may not be able to tell that a filling is wearing down, your dentist can identify weaknesses in them during a regular check-up. If the seal between the tooth enamel and the filling breaks down, food particles and decay-causing bacteria can work their way under the filling. Decay that is left untreated can progress to infect the dental pulp and may cause an abscessed tooth. If the filling is large or the recurrent decay is extensive, there may not be enough tooth structure remaining to support a replacement filling. New fillings that fall out may be the result of improper cavity preparation, contamination before the filling is placed, or a fracture of the filling from bite or chewing trauma."], [453, "Polyp", "Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths among American men and women. These cancers arise from the inner lining of the large intestine, also known as the colon. Colorectal cancer usually begins as a \"polyp,\" a nonspecific term to describe a growth on the inner surface of the colon. The two most common types of polyps found in the colon and rectum include: Hyperplastic and inflammatory polyps. However, large hyperplastic polyps, especially on the right side of the colon, are of concern and should be completely removed. Polyps, which, if left alone, could turn into colon cancer. Although most colorectal polyps do not become cancer, virtually all colon and rectal cancers start from these growths. People may inherit diseases in which the risk of colon polyps and cancer is very high. Colorectal cancer may also develop from areas of abnormal cells in the lining of the colon or rectum. This area of abnormal cells is called dysplasia and is more commonly seen in people with certain inflammatory diseases of the bowel such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Risk factors for colorectal cancer include: A personal or family history of colorectal cancer or polyps A diet high in red meats and processed meats Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) Inherited conditions such as familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer Obesity Smoking Physical inactivity Heavy alcohol use Type 2 diabetes Being African-American Unfortunately, colorectal cancer may strike without symptoms. For this reason, it is very important to talk to your doctor about whether you are at risk for colorectal cancer and should be screened. In addition to getting a medical history and physical exam, there are a number of tests your doctor can perform to help detect colorectal cancer and polyps early. Tests to help detect colorectal polyps and cancer include: Sigmoidoscopy. This test can detect polyps, cancer, and other abnormalities in the sigmoid colon and rectum. During this exam, a biopsy (tissue sample) may also be removed and sent for testing. A stool DNA test looks for changes in genes that are sometimes found in colon cancer cells. This is a special X-ray test (also referred to as a virtual colonoscopy) done of the entire colon using a CT (computed tomography) scanner. The earliest sign of colon cancer may be bleeding. When tumors have grown to a large size they may cause a change in the frequency or the caliber of the stool. Symptoms of colorectal cancer include: A persistent change in bowel habits (such as constipation or diarrhea) Blood on or in the stool Abdominal discomfort Unexplained weight loss Anemia If colorectal polyps are found, they should be removed and sent to a laboratory for microscopic analysis. Once the microscopic type of polyp is determined, the follow-up interval for the next colonoscopy can be made. The majority of colorectal polyps can be removed during a routine colonoscopy and examined under a microscope. If the cancer is found in the early stages, surgery can cure the disease. Advanced colorectal cancers may be treated in a variety of ways, depending on their location. Living a healthy lifestyle that includes no smoking, regular exercise, maintenance of a healthy weight, and a diet that is low in red meat and high in vegetables and fruit is probably your best start at general cancer prevention. Some studies have shown that aspirin and other drugs known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, may help prevent colon cancers. NSAIDs also carry increased risks of serious complications, such as stomach bleeding, heart attacks and strokes. Low dose aspirin is sometimes recommended for prevention of colon cancer in adults ages 50 to 69. General Colorectal Cancer Screening Recommendations: These recommendations are for people at average risk for colorectal cancer without symptoms or a personal or family history of colorectal polyps or cancer or inflammatory bowel disease. A stool DNA test every 3 years looks for changes in DNA that may indicate colon polyps or cancer. This is an outpatient procedure for examining the inside of the lower portion of the large intestine, called the sigmoid colon, and also the rectum. This test can miss polyps, cancer, or other abnormalities that are beyond the reach of the scope. People at higher risk for colorectal cancer include those with a personal history of polyps on previous colonoscopy, colorectal cancer, and/or inflammatory bowel disease, strong family history of colorectal cancer or precancerous polyps, and a family history of a hereditary cancer syndrome. However, the exact age to start screening and interval of testing depends on specific risk factors."], [454, "Polymyositis", "Polymyositis is a systemic connective tissue disorder characterized by inflammatory and degenerative changes in the muscles, leading to symmetric weakness and some degree of muscle atrophy."], [455, "Polymyalgia Rheumatica", "Polymyalgia rheumatica is an infrequently occurring, inflammatory condition that causes pain or aching in the large muscle groups, especially around the shoulders and hips. Symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica tend to develop quickly and in addition to muscle pain, other symptoms may include: Stiffness around the shoulders and hips, especially in the morning and after resting Weakness Fatigue Generally feeling ill Mild fevers (occasionally) Weight loss About 15% of people with polymyalgia rheumatica also have temporal arteritis and about half of people with temporal arteritis also have polymyalgia rheumatica. The name of the condition stems from the fact that some of the affected arteries provide blood to the head, including the temples. Vision changes or distorted vision that's caused by decreased blood flow to the eye. Stroke may occur in less than 5% of patients as a result of decreased blood flow. If narrowing occurs in the blood vessels leading to the arms or legs, patients may notice fatigue or aching in the limbs, due to a reduced blood supply. Other symptoms may include fever, weight loss, night sweats, depression, fatigue, and a general feeling of being ill. Polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis frequently affect the same types of people. Under the new criteria developed by the American College of Rheumatology and The European League Against Rheumatism, patients ages 50 years and older can be classified as having PMR if they meet the conditions below: Shoulder pain on both sides Morning stiffness that lasts at least 45 minutes High levels of inflammation measured by blood tests Reported new hip pain Absence of swelling in the small joints of the hands and feet, and absence of positive blood tests for rheumatoid arthritis The new classification criteria may also help to evaluate existing treatments for polymyalgia rheumatica. Everyone with polymyalgia rheumatica is also tested for temporal arteritis. In most cases the biopsy is helpful, but in some individuals it may be negative or normal, even though the person does have temporal arteritis. Some other illnesses that may be confused with polymyalgia rheumatica include: Rheumatoid arthritis Infections Inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis) Chemical and hormonal abnormalities A variety of muscle diseases Cancer There is no known cure for polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis, but these diseases can be treated and controlled. Corticosteroids -- often called \"steroids\" -- help rapidly relieve the symptoms of both conditions. Treatment with steroids -- usually in the form of prednisone -- is mandatory for temporal arteritis to prevent serious complications, such as blindness. Low doses of steroids are often successful in treating polymyalgia rheumatica. Tocilizumab is given as an injection under the skin to decrease the amount of steroid a person needs. This medicine may be used along with steroids The excellent response to treatment is so uniform that the lack of dramatic improvement, within days, would make the diagnosis of temporal arteritis or polymyalgia rheumatica doubtful. You will have frequent blood tests while taking steroids or other medications to monitor for possible side effects and to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy. These blood tests can usually detect problems before you are aware of any symptoms. Your doctor will frequently evaluate your heart and lung function and blood sugar level, which may increase after you start taking steroids. While being treated for polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis, it is important to keep all appointments with your doctor and the lab, and have your blood pressure checked regularly. Because the medicines used to treat polymyalgia and temporal arteritis increase your chance for developing infections, report symptoms such as a cough, fever, or shortness of breath to your doctor. Long-term steroid treatment (for a few months to several years) requires additional testing and monitoring. The long-term use of steroids can cause osteoporosis (bone loss), which can be detected with scans similar to X-rays. Taking supplements of calcium and vitamin D, sometimes along with prescription medication is recommended to prevent osteoporosis in people taking steroids. Discuss the potential side effects caused by your treatment with your doctor. With careful monitoring and appropriate treatment, most patients with polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis have a normal life span and lifestyle. Most of the time, these diseases can be successfully controlled with steroids and other drugs (including tocilizumab, a rheumatoid arthritis drug which has been touted for people who have trouble with or are nonresponsive to steroids), The success of treatment is related to prompt diagnosis, aggressive treatment, and careful follow-up to prevent or minimize side effects from the medications."], [456, "Polygenic", "Genes are the part of a body cell that contain the biological information that parents pass to their children. Genes are contained in DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), a substance inside the center (nucleus) of cells that contains instructions for the development of the cell. Genes, alone or in combination, determine what features (genetic traits) a person inherits from his or her parents, such as blood type, hair color, eye color, and other characteristics, including risks of developing certain diseases. For a child to be female, she must inherit an X chromosome from each parent (XX). Genetic testing examines a DNA sample for gene changes, or it may analyze the number, arrangement, and characteristics of the chromosomes. Testing may be performed on samples of blood, semen, urine, saliva, stool, body tissues, bone, or hair. You may choose to have genetic testing if you are concerned that you have an increased risk for having or getting a disease that has a genetic cause. The information you obtain from the tests may help you make decisions about your life. For example: If tests show that you have an increased risk for passing on a disease to your child, you may choose to have more genetic testing while you are pregnant (prenatal testing). If tests show that you have an increased risk for developing a disease such as breast cancer, you may make decisions that help lower your risk of breast cancer. You may decide to have a genetic test during pregnancy to find out whether your fetus has a disorder, such as Down syndrome. Genetic testing can be used to find out the identity of a child's father (paternity). There are six main types of genetic testing: Carrier identification determines whether people who have a family history of a specific disease or who are in a group that has an increased chance for that disease are likely to pass on that disease to their children. Information gained from this type of testing can help guide decisions about how to manage a pregnancy, including the decision about whether to end the pregnancy. Newborn screening checks for various metabolic diseases, such as phenylketonuria (PKU). Late-onset disease testing determines whether you carry a genetic change that increases your risk for developing a disease, such as breast cancer or Huntington's disease, later in life. Information from this type of testing can help you make decisions about preventing or managing the disease. Genetic identification (DNA fingerprinting) can be used to determine paternity, help solve crimes, and identify a body. Information from genetic testing can affect your life and the lives of your family members. The emotions you may experience if you learn that you have a greater chance of having or passing on a serious disease can cause you to feel anxious or depressed. A person who tests positive for a disease-specific gene change may decide to use preventive or treatment options to reduce the impact or severity of the disease. Although many treatment options have been shown to be effective, others may be potentially dangerous or of unproven value. Because genetic testing is expensive, few people are able to afford it without help from their insurance companies. Many people worry that genetic information released to insurance companies may affect future employment options or insurance availability. The discovery of a genetic disease that is not causing symptoms now (such as breast cancer or Huntington's disease) should not affect your future ability to gain employment or health insurance coverage. A law in the United States, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), protects people who have DNA differences that may affect their health."], [457, "Polycythemia Vera", "It's a blood cancer that begins in the marrow of your bones, the soft center where new blood cells grow. If you have polycythemia vera, your marrow makes too many red blood cells, which causes your blood to get too thick. That can make you more likely to have blood clots, a stroke, or a heart attack. Although it can be life-threatening if you don't get any treatment, most people have a good chance of living a long life when they get the right care. Most people find out they have this condition when they're 60 or older. Although you might have some warning signs like dizziness or feeling tired and weak, lots of things can cause those problems. If you have polycythemia vera, the first sign may be when a routine blood test shows that you have a high number of blood cells. The treatment you get depends on your age and your particular case. If you don't have a lot of symptoms, your doctor may just want to check you regularly without any treatment. But keep in mind that everyone is different and all cancers aren't the same. With the support of your doctor, family, friends, and other people who have polycythemia vera, you'll be in the best position to manage it. You don't \"catch\" polycythemia vera like you do a cold or the flu. It's something you get because you have a gene called JAK2 that doesn't work right. Your bone marrow makes three types of blood cells: red, white, and platelets. But the disease may also cause you to have too many white blood cells and platelets. Most likely, the problem in your JAK2 gene happened over the course of your life. When you do start having symptoms, you may have: Headaches Double vision or seeing dark or blind spots that come and go Itching all over your body, especially after you've been in warm or hot water Sweating, especially at night Reddened face that looks like sunburn or blushing Weakness Dizziness Weight loss Shortness of breath Tingling or burning in your hands or feet Painful swelling of a joint You may also feel pressure or fullness below the ribs on your left side. Those symptoms come from an enlarged spleen, which happens to some people. Without treatment, the extra red blood cells in your veins can cause blood clots that reduce your blood flow. This makes you more likely to have a stroke and heart attack. If your doctor thinks you might have polycythemia vera, you'll get a physical exam, including a check of your spleen. He'll also see if your face is unusually red. Your doctor may also ask you questions like: Do you get a lot of headaches? Do you sweat a lot at night? Your doctor takes a sample of your blood and sends it to a lab, where a machine counts the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. In this test, your doctor will look at a sample of your blood through a microscope. This test measures how much of the hormone EPO you have in your blood. You may also need to get a bone marrow biopsy. For this test, your doctor will take samples usually from the back of your hip bone. It's an \"outpatient\" procedure, which means you don't have to stay overnight in a hospital. You can get it done in a clinic, a hospital, or in your doctor's office. You lie down on a table and get a shot that will numb the area. Then your doctor uses a needle to remove a small amount of bone marrow. Before your appointment, it's a good idea to make a list of things to ask, such as: Since I have polycythemia vera, am I at risk for a stroke or heart attack? If you don't have many symptoms, you might not need to start treatment yet. If you do need treatment, the goal is to lower the number of red blood cells and prevent blood clots and other complications. After it's done, your blood will be thinner and flow better. Some symptoms will get better, such as headaches or dizziness. That makes you less likely to get blood clots, which can cause heart attacks or strokes. If you need more than phlebotomy and aspirin, your doctor may prescribe hydroxyurea, a pill that lowers your red blood count and relieves symptoms. The drug ruxolitinib(Jakafi) is approved for use in people who aren't helped by hydroxyurea or can't handle its side effects. If you have a lot of itching that doesn't go away, your doctor may prescribe antihistamines. There are a lot of ways you can keep yourself comfortable and as healthy as possible. Do leg and ankle exercises to stop clots from forming in the veins of your legs. Your doctor or a physical therapist can show you how. Bathe or shower in cool water if warm water causes itching. It's rare, but your condition may lead to acute leukemia or myelofibrosis, which are also blood diseases but are more serious than polycythemia vera. Myelofibrosis is a condition in which your bone marrow gets filled with scar tissue. Talk to your friends and family for advice on keeping a positive attitude. You may also want to join a support group for people with polycythemia vera. The foundation can also help you to find support groups."], [458, "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)", "It can cause problems with your periods and make it difficult to get pregnant. PCOS also may cause unwanted changes in the way you look. Most women with PCOS grow many small cysts on their ovaries. The cysts are not harmful but lead to hormone imbalances. Early diagnosis and treatment can help control the symptoms and prevent long-term problems. Hormones are chemical messengers that trigger many different processes, including growth and energy production. For reasons that are not well understood, in PCOS the hormones get out of balance. In PCOS, they start making slightly more androgens. This may cause you to stop ovulating, get acne, and grow extra facial and body hair. The body may have a problem using insulin, called insulin resistance. Over time, this increases your chance of getting diabetes. The cause of PCOS is not fully understood, but genetics may be a factor. PCOS seems to run in families, so your chance of having it is higher if other women in your family have it or have irregular periods or diabetes. PCOS can be passed down from either your mother's or father's side. Symptoms tend to be mild at first. You may have only a few symptoms or a lot of them. The most common symptoms are: Acne. Often women get thicker and darker facial hair and more hair on the chest, belly, and back. Often women with PCOS have fewer than nine periods a year. Many women who have PCOS have trouble getting pregnant (infertility). To diagnose PCOS, the doctor will: Ask questions about your past health, symptoms, and menstrual cycles. Do a physical exam to look for signs of PCOS, such as extra body hair and high blood pressure. The doctor will also check your height and weight to see if you have a healthy body mass index (BMI). Do a number of lab tests to check your blood sugar, insulin, and other hormone levels. Hormone tests can help rule out thyroid or other gland problems that could cause similar symptoms. You may also have a pelvic ultrasound to look for cysts on your ovaries. Your doctor may be able to tell you that you have PCOS without an ultrasound, but this test will help him or her rule out other problems. Regular exercise, healthy foods, and weight control are the key treatments for PCOS. Treatment can reduce unpleasant symptoms and help prevent long-term health problems. It limits foods that are high in saturated fat, such as meats, cheeses, and fried foods. Most women who have PCOS can benefit from losing weight. Even losing 10 lb (4.5 kg) may help get your hormones in balance and regulate your menstrual cycle. Women who smoke have higher androgen levels that may contribute to PCOS symptoms.1 Your doctor also may prescribe birth control pills to reduce symptoms, metformin to help you have regular menstrual cycles, or fertility medicines if you are having trouble getting pregnant. It is important to see your doctor for follow-up to make sure that treatment is working and to adjust it if needed. You may also need regular tests to check for diabetes, high blood pressure, and other possible problems. It may take a while for treatments to help with symptoms such as facial hair or acne. You can use over-the-counter or prescription medicines for acne. It can be hard to deal with having PCOS. If you are feeling sad or depressed, it may help to talk to a counselor or to other women who have PCOS."], [459, "Pollen", "Flowers are blooming, or lawns or trees are bursting with new greenery, and -- like clockwork -- your eyes water, your nose runs, and the sneezes keep coming. Every year, you have the same symptoms when spring (or summer or fall) is in the air. You probably have seasonal allergies, which are sometimes called hay fever. If you have a pollen allergy and go outside on a day when it's flying around, your body will react as if it's being invaded. When this happens, you can have symptoms like: Itchy throat Red, itchy, watery eyes Runny or stuffy nose Sneezing Wheezing or coughing Your doctor may first want to confirm that you have an allergy. An allergist can give you a skin-prick test to see what's causing your problem. Once that's narrowed down, there are a few ways to treat pollen allergies: Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. If your nose is stuffy, decongestants can help you breathe easier. If the OTC drugs don't work, your doctor may prescribe something stronger. Some prescribed meds block chemicals other than histamine that can trigger allergies. If you don't have any luck with medications, allergy shots may help. You'll go to the allergist every few weeks for the doctor to inject a tiny amount of what's causing your problem under your skin. After a period of months, your body should get used to the trigger and your symptoms should get better. If you know it's going to be a high-pollen day, stay inside as much as you can. Instead of opening the windows in your car or at home, run your air conditioner with an HEPA filter to remove pollen from the air. Don't hang your laundry on a line to dry or it will pick up pollen; use the dryer. If you've spent time outside, change your clothing, shower, and wash your hair before you get into bed. If you don't, you'll transfer pollen to your pillow and blankets and breathe it in all night. If you let your pet spend time outside, don't allow it into your bedroom. Wear sunglasses to protect your eyes and a hat to keep pollen off your hair. When pollen counts are high, take your medication before you notice symptoms to stop them before they start."], [460, "Podagra", "Gout is arthritis that happens when you have too much uric acid in your blood and it forms sharp crystals in one of your joints. It usually affects only one joint at a time, but if it's not treated, you might end up with it in your knee, ankle, foot, hand, wrist, or elbow. The most common signs of a gout attack are: Sudden and severe pain in a joint, usually in the middle of the night or early morning Tenderness in the joint. It can also be warm to the touch and look red or purple Stiffness in the joint If gout isn't treated over long periods of time, the crystals can form lumps under the skin around the joint. And if the crystals accumulate in the urinary tract, they can form kidney stones. If you have an attack of gout, call your doctor as soon as possible. Until your appointment, you can ice and elevate the joint, and take anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin and ibuprofen."], [461, "Pneumonia", "Pneumonia is a lung infection that can make you very sick. You may cough, run a fever, and have a hard time breathing. For most people, pneumonia can be treated at home. But older adults, babies, and people with other diseases can become very ill. You can get pneumonia in your daily life, such as at school or work. You can also get it when you are in a hospital or nursing home. It may be more severe because you already are ill. This topic focuses on pneumonia you get in your daily life. Germs called bacteria or viruses usually cause pneumonia. Pneumonia usually starts when you breathe the germs into your lungs. You may be more likely to get the disease after having a cold or the flu. These illnesses make it hard for your lungs to fight infection, so it is easier to get pneumonia. Having a long-term, or chronic, disease like asthma, heart disease, cancer, or diabetes also makes you more likely to get pneumonia. You will likely cough up mucus (sputum) from your lungs. Chest pain that often feels worse when you cough or breathe in. When you have mild symptoms, your doctor may call this \"walking pneumonia.\" Older adults may have different, fewer, or milder symptoms. Or they may have a cough but not bring up mucus. The main sign of pneumonia in older adults may be a change in how well they think. Or, if they already have a lung disease, that disease may get worse. Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and do a physical exam. He or she may order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count (CBC). This is usually enough for your doctor to know if you have pneumonia. You may need more tests if you have bad symptoms, are an older adult, or have other health problems. In general, the sicker you are, the more tests you may need. Your doctor may also test mucus from your lungs to find out if bacteria are causing your pneumonia. Finding out what is causing your pneumonia can help your doctor choose the best treatment for you. If pneumonia is caused by bacteria, your doctor will give you antibiotics. You need to take the full course of antibiotics. Pneumonia can make you feel very sick. But after you take antibiotics, you should start to feel much better. Call your doctor if you do not start to feel better after 2 to 3 days of antibiotics. There are things you can do to feel better during your treatment. Get plenty of rest and sleep, and drink lots of liquids. If your cough keeps you awake at night, talk to your doctor about using cough medicine. You may need to go to the hospital if you have bad symptoms, a weak immune system, or another serious illness. Pneumonia caused by a virus usually is not treated with antibiotics. Sometimes, antibiotics may be used to prevent complications. If you smoke, or you have a long-term health problem, it's a good idea to get a pneumococcal vaccine. It may not keep you from getting pneumonia. But if you do get pneumonia, you probably won't be as sick. You can also get an influenza vaccine to prevent the flu, because sometimes people get pneumonia after having the flu. You can also lower your chances of getting pneumonia by staying away from people who have a cold, measles, or chickenpox. You may get pneumonia after you have one of these illnesses."], [462, "Pneumonectomy", "Lung surgery to remove the cancer may be an option when your cancer is in only one lung or present in one lung and in nearby lymph nodes. It usually is done only if your doctor thinks all the cancer can be removed and your general health is good enough for you to handle the surgery. Nearby lymph nodes may also be removed to find out whether the cancer has spread. The type of surgery performed depends on the location and size of your lung cancer: Wedge resection. The surgeon removes a small wedge-shaped piece of lung that contains the lung cancer and a margin of healthy tissue around the cancer. The right lung has three lobes and the left lung has two lobes. A lobectomy removes the entire lobe of your lung that contains the cancer. A pneumonectomy removes your entire lung that contains the lung cancer. There is less pain with surgery that is minimally invasive (VATS) than the traditional surgery (thoracotomy)."], [463, "Pleuritis", "It affects a part of your body you may not have heard of: your pleura. Your lungs are wrapped in a thin layer of tissue called pleura. These layers keep your bare lungs from rubbing up against the wall of your chest cavity every time that you breathe in. But if your pleura has a problem, there's no doubt you'll feel it. When the pleura are swollen and inflamed, they rub against each other in a very painful way each time that your lungs expand as you take a breath. When you inhale deeply, cough, sneeze or laugh, you'll likely feel a sharp, stabbing pain in the area of this inflammation. If your doctor treats your infection, that can make the pleurisy -- and the pain -- go away. It can also be caused by a virus such as the flu, or by a fungus. Some other things that can cause pleurisy to strike are: Lung cancer A blood clot in the lung Other types of cancer that affect the lungs or pleura An autoimmune disease, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis The chest pain that's due to pleurisy has telltale signs that often make it easy for your doctor to know that you have it. You're likely to notice these things: A sharp, stabbing pain causes you to take small, shallow breaths, because it's worse when you try to breathe deeply. Your doctor will want you to describe the type of pain you feel when you breathe or cough, and he'll ask whether it gets better or worse as the day goes on. (Doctors often can hear the pleura rubbing against each other.) You may also need to have tests done, such as: Imaging. If your doctor wants to rule out other problems besides pleurisy, he may send you for an X-ray, a CT scan, or even an ultrasound. These images can show if it's pleurisy that's causing your pain. It may also reveal if you have an autoimmune disease like lupus, or another problem. An electrocardiogram of your heart might show that your chest pain is caused by a heart problem, not pleurisy. In order to treat your pleurisy the right way, your doctor first must find out what's causing it: If it's bacteria, antibiotics can make you better. If coughing hurts too much, your doctor might prescribe a drug (codeine) that can reduce the amount that you cough. You may feel better if you lie on the side that's causing you pain. As the pain starts to go away, try to breathe more deeply and cough up any phlegm that you have."], [464, "Pleura", "(c) 2014 WebMD, LLC. Prev Next Prev Next The lungs are a pair of spongy, air-filled organs located on either side of the chest (thorax). The trachea (windpipe) conducts inhaled air into the lungs through its tubular branches, called bronchi. The bronchi then divide into smaller and smaller branches (bronchioles), finally becoming microscopic. The bronchioles eventually end in clusters of microscopic air sacs called alveoli. Carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, travels from the blood to the alveoli, where it can be exhaled. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): Damage to the lungs results in difficulty blowing air out, causing shortness of breath. The fragile walls between the lungs' air sacs (alveoli) are damaged, trapping air in the lungs and making breathing difficult. Chronic bronchitis: Repeated, frequent episodes of productive cough, usually caused by smoking. Bacteria, especially Streptococcus pneumoniae, are the most common cause. Asthma: The lungs' airways (bronchi) become inflamed and can spasm, causing shortness of breath and wheezing. Acute bronchitis: An infection of the lungs' large airways (bronchi), usually caused by a virus. The interstitium (walls between air sacs) become scarred, making the lungs stiff and causing shortness of breath. Sarcoidosis: Tiny areas of inflammation can affect all organs in the body, with the lungs involved most of the time. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: Extra weight makes it difficult to expand the chest when breathing. Pleural effusion: Fluid builds up in the normally tiny space between the lung and the inside of the chest wall (the pleural space). Pleurisy: Inflammation of the lining of the lung (pleura), which often causes pain when breathing in. Bronchiectasis: The airways (bronchi) become inflamed and expand abnormally, usually after repeated infections. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM): A rare condition in which cysts form throughout the lungs, causing breathing problems similar to emphysema. Cystic fibrosis: A genetic condition in which mucus does not clear easily from the airways. Interstitial lung disease: A collection of conditions in which the interstitium (lining between the air sacs) becomes diseased. Fibrosis (scarring) of the interstitium eventually results, if the process can't be stopped. Tuberculosis: A slowly progressive pneumonia caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Severe, sudden injury to the lungs caused by a serious illness. Life support with mechanical ventilation is usually needed to survive until the lungs recover. Coccidioidomycosis: A pneumonia caused by Coccidioides, a fungus found in the soil in the southwestern U.S. Histoplasmosis: An infection caused by inhaling Histoplasma capsulatum, a fungus found in the soil in the eastern and central U.S. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (allergic alveolitis): Inhaled dust causes an allergic reaction in the lungs. Usually this occurs in farmers or others who work with dried, dusty plant material. Influenza (flu): An infection by one or more flu viruses causes fever, body aches, and coughing lasting a week or more. Influenza can progress to life-threatening pneumonia, especially in older people with medical problems. Pertussis (whooping cough): A highly contagious infection of the airways (bronchi) by Bordetella pertussis, causing persistent cough. A booster vaccine (Tdap) is recommended for adolescents and adults to prevent pertussis. Pulmonary hypertension: Many conditions can lead to high blood pressure in the arteries leading from the heart to the lungs. If no cause can be identified, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Pulmonary embolism: A blood clot (usually from a vein in the leg) may break off and travel to the heart, which pumps the clot (embolus) into the lungs. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): A severe pneumonia caused by a specific virus first discovered in Asia in 2002. Worldwide prevention measures seem to have controlled SARS, which has caused no deaths in the U.S. Pneumothorax: Air in the chest; it occurs when air enters the area around the lung (the pleural space) abnormally. It can identify air or fluid in the chest, fluid in the lung, pneumonia, masses, foreign bodies, and other problems. Computed tomography (CT scan): A CT scan uses X-rays and a computer to make detailed pictures of the lungs and nearby structures. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs): A series of tests to evaluate how well the lungs work. Lung capacity, the ability to exhale forcefully, and the ability to transfer air between the lungs and blood are usually tested. Lung biopsy: A small piece of tissue is taken from the lungs, either through bronchoscopy or surgery. Flexible bronchoscopy: An endoscope (flexible tube with a lighted camera on its end) is passed through the nose or mouth into the airways (bronchi). Rigid bronchoscopy: A rigid metal tube is introduced through the mouth into the lungs' airways. Rigid bronchoscopy is often more effective than flexible bronchoscopy, but it requires general (total) anesthesia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan): An MRI scanner uses radio waves in a magnetic field to create high-resolution images of structures inside the chest. Video-assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS): Less-invasive chest wall surgery using an endoscope (flexible tube with a camera on its end). Chest tube (thoracostomy): A tube is inserted through an incision in the chest wall in order to drain fluid or air from around the lung. Pleurocentesis: A needle is placed into the chest cavity to drain fluid that's around the lung. Antiviral drugs: When used soon after flu symptoms start, antiviral medicines can reduce the severity of influenza. Steroids can also be used to treat less common lung conditions caused by inflammation. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP): Air pressure applied by a machine through a mask keeps the airways open. Most often, lung resection is used to treat lung cancer. Vasodilators: People with some forms of pulmonary hypertension may require long-term medicines to lower the pressure in their lungs."], [465, "Pleomorphic", "Your salivary glands make as much as a quart of saliva each day. Saliva is important to lubricate your mouth, help with swallowing, protect your teeth against bacteria, and aid in the digestion of food. The three major pairs of salivary glands are: parotid glands on the insides of the cheeks submandibular glands at the floor of the mouth sublingual glands under the tongue There are also several hundred minor salivary glands throughout the mouth and throat. When there is a problem with the salivary glands or ducts, you may have symptoms such as salivary gland swelling, dry mouth, pain, fever, and foul-tasting drainage into the mouth. Many different problems can interfere with the function of the salivary glands or block the ducts so they can't drain saliva. The following are some of the more common salivary gland problems: Salivary stones, or sialoliths. The most common cause of swollen salivary glands, salivary stones are buildups of crystallized saliva deposits. Sometimes salivary stones can block the flow of saliva. Pain is usually off and on, is felt in one gland, and gets progressively worse. Bacterial infection of the salivary gland, most commonly the parotid gland, may result when the duct into the mouth is blocked. Sialadenitis creates a painful lump in the gland, and foul-tasting pus drains into the mouth. If not treated, salivary gland infections can cause severe pain, high fevers, and abscess (pus collection). Viral infections such as mumps, flu, and others can cause swelling of the salivary glands. Swelling happens in parotid glands on both sides of the face, giving the appearance of \"chipmunk cheeks.\" Salivary gland swelling is commonly associated with mumps, happening in about 30% to 40% of mumps infections. It usually begins approximately 48 hours after the start of other symptoms such as fever and headache. Other viral illnesses that cause salivary gland swelling include the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Coxsackievirus, and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The bacteria are typically those found normally in the mouth, as well as staph bacteria. Dehydration and malnutrition raise the risk of getting a bacterial infection. Cysts can develop in the salivary glands if injuries, infections, tumors, or salivary stones block the flow of saliva.Some babies are born with cysts in the parotid gland due to a problem with the development of the ears. Several different types of tumors can affect the salivary glands. The two most common tumors are pleomorphic adenomas and Warthin's tumor. Pleomorphic adenomas most commonly affect the parotid glands, but can also affect the submandibular gland and minor salivary glands. Warthin's tumor is also benign and affects the parotid gland. Warthin's tumor can grow on both sides of the face and affects more men than women. This is a chronic autoimmune disease in which cells of a person's immune system attack the salivary and other moisture-producing glands, leading to dry mouth and eyes. About half of people with Sjogren's syndrome also have enlargement of the salivary glands on both sides of the mouth, which is usually painless. Treatment for salivary gland problems depends on the cause."], [466, "Platelet", "Prev Next Prev Next Blood is a constantly circulating fluid providing the body with nutrition, oxygen, and waste removal. A liquid called plasma makes up about half of the content of blood. Plasma contains proteins that help blood to clot, transport substances through the blood, and perform other functions. About half of blood volume is composed of blood cells: * Red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the tissues * White blood cells, which fight infections * Platelets, smaller cells that help blood to clot Blood is conducted through blood vessels (arteries and veins). Blood is prevented from clotting in the blood vessels by their smoothness, and the finely tuned balance of clotting factors. Hemorrhage (bleeding): Blood leaking out of blood vessels may be obvious, as from a wound penetrating the skin. Leukemia: A form of blood cancer, in which white blood cells multiply abnormally and circulate through the blood. The abnormal white blood cells make getting sick from infections easier than normal. Multiple myeloma: A form of blood cancer of plasma cells similar to leukemia. Lymphoma: A form of blood cancer, in which white blood cells multiply abnormally inside lymph nodes and other tissues. The enlarging tissues, and disruption of blood's functions, can eventually cause organ failure. Anemia: An abnormally low number of red blood cells in the blood. Hemolytic anemia: Anemia caused by rapid bursting of large numbers of red blood cells (hemolysis). Sickle cell disease: A genetic condition in which red blood cells periodically lose their proper shape (appearing like sickles, rather than discs). The deformed blood cells deposit in tissues, causing pain and organ damage. Blood infections are serious, and often require hospitalization and continuous antibiotic infusion into the veins. Malaria: Infection of red blood cells by Plasmodium, a parasite transmitted by mosquitos. Leukopenia: Abnormally low numbers of white blood cells in the blood. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): An uncontrolled process of simultaneous bleeding and clotting in very small blood vessels. Hemophilia: An inherited (genetic) deficiency of certain blood clotting proteins. Hypercoaguable state: Numerous conditions can result in the blood being prone to clotting. Polycythemia: Abnormally high numbers of red blood cells in the blood. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT): A blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the leg. DVTs are dangerous because they may become dislodged and travel to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism (PE). Myocardial infarction (MI): Commonly called a heart attack, a myocardial infarction occurs when a sudden blood clot develops in one of the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart. Complete blood count: An analysis of the concentration of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in the blood. The major blood types (A, B, AB, and O) are determined by the protein markers (antigens) present on the surface of red blood cells. Coombs test: A blood test looking for antibodies that could bind to and destroy red blood cells. Mixing study: A blood test to identify the reason for blood being \"too thin\" (abnormally resistant to clotting). Bone marrow biopsy: A thick needle is inserted into a large bone (usually in the hip), and bone marrow is drawn out for tests. Platelet transfusion: A blood donor's platelets are separated from the rest of blood and concentrated into a plastic bag. Fresh frozen plasma: A blood donor's plasma (liquid blood) is separated from the blood cells, and frozen for storage. Plasma transfusion can improve blood clotting and prevent or stop bleeding that's due to clotting problems. Cryoprecipitate: Specific proteins are separated from blood and frozen in a small volume of liquid. Anticoagulation: Medicines to \"thin\" the blood and prevent clotting in people at high risk from blood clots. Heparin, enoxaparin (Lovenox) and warfarin (Coumadin) are the medicines most often used. Antiplatelet drugs: Aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix) interfere with platelet function and help prevent blood clots, including those that cause heart attacks and strokes. Antibiotics: Medicines to kill bacteria and parasites can treat blood infections caused by these organisms. Erythropoietin: A hormone produced by the kidney that stimulates red blood cell production."], [467, "Plasticity", "Can you help your brain stay healthy as you age by doing things that challenge your mind? Could that also help you avoid memory loss, or even prevent or delay dementia such as Alzheimer's? But a number of studies show there are benefits to staying mentally active. When people keep their minds active, their thinking skills are less likely to decline, medical research shows. So games, puzzles, and other types of brain training may help slow memory loss and other mental problems. They also improved at everyday tasks, such as the ability to manage money and do housework. One study found that exercising the mind delayed declines in thinking skills. After people started having Alzheimer's symptoms, though, mental decline sped up in those who kept their minds engaged. It's possible that being mentally active bolstered the brain at first, so symptoms didn't show up until later. People who regularly challenge their minds may spend a shorter part of their lives in a state of decline, even if they do get Alzheimer's. But the main idea seems to be keeping your brain active and challenged. You can also: Learn something new, such as a second language or a musical instrument. Studies of animals show that keeping the mind active may: Reduce the amount of brain cell damage that happens with Alzheimer's Support the growth of new nerve cells Prompt nerve cells to send messages to each other When you keep your brain active with exercises or other tasks, you may help build up a reserve supply of brain cells and links between them. You might even grow new brain cells. This may be one reason scientists have seen a link between Alzheimer's and lower levels of education. Experts think the extra mental activity from education may protect the brain by strengthening connections between its cells. Neither education nor brain exercises are a sure way to prevent Alzheimer's. But they may help delay symptoms and keep the mind working better for longer."], [468, "Plasmapheresis", "To diagnose anemia, your doctor will likely ask you about your medical history, perform a physical exam, and order blood tests. Your doctor will look for symptoms of anemia and other physical clues that might point to a cause. There are basically three different causes of anemia: blood loss, decreased or faulty red blood cell production, or destruction of red blood cells. Blood tests will not only confirm the diagnosis of anemia, but also help point to the underlying condition. Tests might include: Complete blood count (CBC), which determines the number, size, volume, and hemoglobin content of red blood cells Blood iron level and your serum ferritin level, the best indicators of your body's total iron stores Levels of vitamin B12 and folate, vitamins necessary for red blood cell production Special blood tests to detect rare causes of anemia, such as an immune attack on your red blood cells, red blood cell fragility, and defects of enzymes, hemoglobin, and clotting Reticulocyte count, bilirubin, and other blood and urine tests to determine how quickly your blood cells are being made or if you have a hemolytic anemia, where your red blood cells have a shortened life span Only in rare cases will a doctor need to remove a sample of bone marrow to determine the cause of your anemia. Anemia Caused by Blood Loss If you suddenly lose a large volume of blood, you may be treated with fluids, a blood transfusion, oxygen, and possibly iron to help your body build new red blood cells. Chronic blood loss is treated by identifying the source of bleeding, stopping the bleeding, and, if necessary, providing treatment for iron-deficiency anemia. Anemia Caused by Decreased Red Blood Cell Production The type of treatment you receive depends on the cause of decreased red blood cell production. Anemia Caused by Iron DeficiencyWithout adequate iron, the body is unable to produce normal red blood cells. Non-menstruating women or men who develop iron deficiency need to have a colon exam (colonoscopy or barium enema) to help identify the source of chronic bleeding. With iron deficiency anemia, your doctor will probably recommend iron supplements that contain the ferrous form of iron, which your body can absorb easily. Timed-release iron supplements are not a good choice for most people, because iron is primarily absorbed in the upper part of the digestive tract. If you use iron supplements, remember the following cautions: Always consult with your doctor before taking iron supplements. The body absorbs iron best when taken in a mildly acidic medium, so your doctor may suggest taking iron with a half-glass of orange juice or with vitamin C. Your doctor may also recommend that you increase the amount of iron in your diet. Good dietary sources of iron include red meat, beans, egg yolk, whole-grain products, nuts, and seafood. Your doctor will monitor your red blood cell counts, including hematocrit, hemoglobin, and ferritin levels, during treatment. If your anemia doesn't improve with iron supplements, your doctor will look for some other underlying cause. In rare cases, your doctor may prescribe iron injections or give you iron intravenously (through a needle in the vein). In extremely rare cases of life-threatening iron-deficiency anemia, treatment may involve a blood transfusion. Anemia Caused By Vitamin B12 and Folate Deficiency Treatment depends on the cause of the deficiency. If your body stores are depleted of vitamin B12, your doctor will most likely prescribe vitamin B12 injections. Vitamin B12 can also been given under the tongue or in a nasal spray, but these preparations are expensive and have not been adequately studied to be recommended. Some people with vitamin B12 deficiency have a permanent inability to absorb vitamin B12 and will need injections every one to three months or pills daily for the rest of their lives. Some forms of gastric bypass surgery are associated with deficiencies of iron, vitamin B12, and other nutrients typically absorbed in the part of the stomach that is bypassed. Your doctor may also recommend that you increase the amount of vitamin B12 in your diet. If you have a folate deficiency, your doctor will prescribe folic acid supplements (folic acid is a form of folate used in dietary supplements and fortified foods.) Good dietary sources of folate include fresh fruits, green leafy vegetables, and cruciferous vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts); dairy products; and whole grain cereals. Anemia Caused by Problems of the Bone Marrow and Stem Cells. The treatments for hereditary anemias, such as thalassemia or sickle cell disease, vary widely and depend on the specific condition and the severity of symptoms. Anemia caused by chronic kidney disease or following chemotherapy can often be treated with an injection of recombinant human erythropoietin (Epogen, Procrit) or darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp). Erythropoietin is a hormone that stimulate the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. Anemia Caused by Increased Red Blood Cell Destruction The treatment of hemolytic anemia will be tailored to the underlying cause. Other people with hemolytic anemia may need surgery to replace faulty heart valves, remove a tumor, or repair abnormal blood vessels. Steroids can halt the body's immune attack on its own red blood cells. If hemolytic anemia persists despite treatment, your doctor may recommend splenectomy -- surgical removal of the spleen -- as a last resort. Longstanding hemolytic anemia can cause gallstones to develop from the by-products of red blood cell destruction. A type of hemolytic anemia that occurs more commonly in children is associated with kidney damage, and dialysis may be necessary. In extremely rare cases, bone marrow transplantation may be the only solution for certain types of hemolytic anemia. Sickle Cell Anemia Occasionally, children with sickle cell disease who have an appropriate donor may be cured by a bone marrow transplant. Alternatively, a drug called hydroxyurea appears to stimulate the formation of an alternate form of hemoglobin that isn't susceptible to the sickling, and may be used to reduce the frequency of bone pain. You can help prevent iron-deficiency anemia by eating a well-balanced diet that includes good sources of iron, vitamin B12, and folate. Steps to take include the following: If you are a vegetarian or vegan, talk to your doctor or a nutritionist about your diet and any possible need for supplements. Ask your doctor or nutritionist if you should take vitamin C. Vitamin C makes the stomach more acidic and may improve the absorption of iron in your diet. Other offenders include the preservative EDTA, fiber, large amounts of calcium, and the phytates found in some vegetables. Ask your doctor or local public health authorities about getting your dishes and other eating utensils tested for lead."], [469, "Plasma Cell", "Your blood is typed, or classified, according to the presence or absence of certain markers (antigens) found on red blood cells and in the plasma that allow your body to recognize blood as its own. If another blood type is introduced, your immune system recognizes it as foreign and attacks it, resulting in a transfusion reaction. People with type AB blood are called universal recipients, because they can receive any of the ABO types. People with type O blood are called universal donors, because their blood can be given to people with any of the ABO types. Mismatches with the ABO and Rh blood types are responsible for the most serious, sometimes life-threatening, transfusion reactions. For every 1 million units of blood transfused, getting the wrong blood type happens, at the most, 4 times.1 Transfusion with the wrong blood type can cause a severe reaction that may be life-threatening.2 The Rh system classifies blood as Rh-positive or Rh-negative, based on the presence or absence of Rh antibodies in the blood. People with Rh-positive blood can receive Rh-negative blood, but people with Rh-negative blood will have a transfusion reaction if they receive Rh-positive blood. Transfusion reactions caused by mismatched Rh blood types can be serious. Most have little or no effect on blood transfusions, but a few of them may be the main causes of mild transfusion reactions."], [470, "Plasma", "Immunoglobulin (also called gamma globulin or immune globulin) is a substance made from human blood plasma. The plasma, processed from donated human blood, contains antibodies that protect the body against diseases. When you are given an immunoglobulin, your body uses antibodies from other people's blood plasma to help prevent illness. And even though immunoglobulins are obtained from blood, they are purified so that they can't pass on diseases to the person who receives them. Decrease the immune system's ability to attack body tissues in some cases of autoimmune disease. Help people who have an inherited problem making their own antibodies or those who are having treatment for certain types of cancer (such as leukemia). Treatments for some cancers can cause the body to stop producing its own antibodies, making immunoglobulin treatment necessary. You may be given an immunoglobulin if you are exposed to certain infectious diseases, such as hepatitis A, rubella, or measles. The time period during which an injection provides this benefit ranges from days to months, depending on the disease. It is still possible to get the disease after the immunoglobulin has worn off. When an Rh-negative woman becomes pregnant with an Rh-positive fetus (which can occur when the father's blood is Rh-positive), the pregnant woman's immune system makes antibodies that can destroy the fetus's blood in a future pregnancy. This antibody response is called Rh sensitization and occurs only if the fetus's blood mixes with the pregnant woman's, which can happen during birth. Immunoglobulin is sometimes used to treat idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), an immune disorder in which the body attacks the cells responsible for blood clotting (platelets), resulting in bleeding. Steroids (such as prednisone) or other medicines may be needed to suppress the immune system. An intravenous (IV) infusion of a substance made from human blood plasma (immunoglobulin) may be given. In rare cases, the spleen may need to be removed."], [471, "Plaque", "Plaque is the sticky, colorless film of bacteria that forms on teeth. It makes teeth \"feel fuzzy\" to the tongue and is most noticeable when teeth are not brushed. Plaque develops when foods containing carbohydrates (sugars and starches), such as milk, soft drinks, raisins, cakes, or candy are frequently left on the teeth. Plaque can also develop on the tooth roots under the gum and cause breakdown of the bone supporting the tooth. To prevent plaque buildup, brush your teeth at least twice a day with a soft, rounded-tip bristled toothbrush. Pay particular attention to the space where the gums and teeth meet. Dental sealants are a thin, plastic coating that are painted on the chewing surfaces of teeth to protect them from cavities and decay. If you need a snack, choose nutritious foods such as plain yogurt, cheese, fruit, or raw vegetables. Vegetables, such as celery, help remove food and help saliva neutralize plaque-causing acids."], [472, "plantar reflex", "The nerves that carry messages to and from your legs come from your low back. By checking your muscle strength, your reflexes, and your sensation (feeling), your doctor can tell whether there is pressure on a nerve root coming from your spinal column. Muscle strength tests can detect true muscle weakness, which is one sign of pressure on a nerve root. (Sometimes leg weakness is actually due to pain, not pressure on a nerve.) Nerve root compression usually originates in the lumbosacral region . Specific muscles receive impulses from specific nerves, so finding out which muscles are weak shows your doctor where nerve roots are being compressed. You sit on the edge of the exam table with your knees bent and feet hanging down. If your painful leg is weaker than the other leg, you may have nerve root compression at the higher part of your low back, in the area of the last thoracic and the first, second, and third lumbar vertebrae (T12, L1, L2, L3 region). While in the sitting position, you straighten out your knee while your doctor pushes down on your leg near your ankle. If your painful leg is weaker than the other leg, you may have nerve root compression at the second, third, or fourth lumbar vertebrae (L2, L3, or L4 region). While you are in the sitting position, your doctor pushes down on your feet while you try to pull your ankles upward. If there is weakness in one leg, the ankle will give way to the downward pressure. This is a sign of possible nerve root compression at the level of the fifth lumbar vertebra (L4 or L5 region). While you are in the sitting position, your doctor pushes down on your big toes while you try to extend them (bend them back toward you). If there is weakness in one leg, its big toe will give way to the pressure. This is a sign of possible nerve root compression at the level of the fifth lumbar vertebra (L5 region). Toe raises are difficult, if not impossible, to do if a particular nerve region is compressed. This is a sign of possible nerve root compression at the level of the first sacral vertebra (S1 region). Just as your muscles receive signals through certain nerves, other nerves carry signals back to your spinal cord from specific sections of your skin and other tissues. Testing your sense of feeling helps your doctor find out what nerve root may be compressed. You sit on the exam table with your knee bent and your foot hanging down, not touching the floor. A decreased or absent reflex may mean that there is compression in the L2, L3, or L4 region. You sit on a table with your knees bent and feet hanging down, or you may be asked to lie down on your stomach with your legs straight and your feet off the edge of the exam table. Your doctor will use a rubber hammer to tap firmly on the Achilles tendon, which connects the muscle at the back of your calf to your heel bone. A decreased or absent reflex may mean that there is compression in the S1 region."], [473, "Placebo", "Researchers use placebos during studies to help them understand what effect a new drug or some other treatment might have on a particular condition. For instance, some people in a study might be given a new drug to lower cholesterol. Researchers then compare the effects of the drug and the placebo on the people in the study. That way, they can determine the effectiveness of the new drug and check for side effects. There are some conditions in which a placebo can produce results even when people know they are taking a placebo. Studies show that placebos can have an effect on conditions such as: Depression Pain Sleep disorders Irritable bowel syndrome Menopause In one study involving asthma, people using a placebo inhaler did no better on breathing tests than sitting and doing nothing. But when researchers asked for people's perception of how they felt, the placebo inhaler was reported as being as effective as medicine in providing relief. Research on the placebo effect has focused on the relationship of mind and body. One of the most common theories is that the placebo effect is due to a person's expectations. If a person expects a pill to do something, then it's possible that the body's own chemistry can cause effects similar to what a medication might have caused. For instance, in one study, people were given a placebo and told it was a stimulant. When people were given the same pill and told it was to help them get to sleep, they experienced the opposite effects. If people expect to have side effects such as headaches, nausea, or drowsiness, there is a greater chance of those reactions happening. Some studies show that there are actual physical changes that occur with the placebo effect. For instance, some studies have documented an increase in the body's production of endorphins, one of the body's natural pain relievers. One problem with the placebo effect is that it can be difficult to distinguish from the actual effects of a real drug during a study. And more study may also lead to ways to use the power of the placebo effect in treating disease."], [474, "Pineal Cysts, Symptomatic", "Pineal cysts are benign (non-cancerous) fluid-filled sacs located in the region of the brain that contains the pineal gland. Small pineal cysts (.5 cm or smaller) are common occurrences, often found incidentally on routine neurological exams. Larger pineal cysts are rare findings that may cause a variety of symptoms (symptomatic). Symptoms may include headaches, increased pressure on the brain because of accumulation of excessive cerebrospinal fluid (hydrocephalus), and vision abnormalities."], [475, "Pilonidal Disease", "Pilonidal (say \"py-luh-NY-dul\") disease is a chronic skin infection in the crease between the buttocks. People with this condition have one or more cysts in that area that tend to get inflamed and infected. A pilonidal cyst may look like a small dimple (called a \"pit\" or \"sinus\"). See a picture of a pilonidal cyst . Experts think pilonidal cysts may form in one of three ways: A hair follicle in the skin becomes irritated or stretched. The hair follicle may become blocked and infected and then open into the surrounding tissue, forming an abscess. Continued exercise or walking often pulls hair into the abscess. A loose hair may get trapped in the crease between the buttocks. The hair can poke into the skin, especially if there is already an irritated hair follicle.

Infants with Catel-Manzke syndrome have an extra (supernumerary), irregularly shaped bone (i.e., hyperphalangy) located between the first bone of the index finger (proximal phalanx) and the corresponding bone within the body of the hand (second metacarpal). Due to the presence of micrognathia, glossoptosis, and cleft palate, affected infants may have feeding and breathing difficulties; growth deficiency; repeated middle ear infections (otitis media); and/or other complications.

If pica is suspected, a medical evaluation is important to assess for possible anemia, intestinal blockages, or potential toxicity from ingested substances. The doctor may use certain tests -- such as X-rays and blood tests -- to check for anemia and look for toxins and other substances in the blood, and to check for blockages in the intestinal tract. The doctor also may test for possible infections caused by eating items contaminated with bacteria or other organisms. Before making a diagnosis of pica, the doctor will evaluate the presence of other disorders -- such as mental retardation, developmental disabilities, or obsessive-compulsive disorder -- as the cause of the odd eating behavior. Given the risk of medical complications (such as lead poisoning) associated with pica, close medical monitoring is necessary throughout treatment of the eating behavior. The Handbook for Clinical Child Psychology currently supports general behavioral strategies as the most effective treatment approach for pica, with training in which foods are edible and which foods cannot be eaten through the use of positive reinforcement. There are many potential complications of pica, such as: Certain items, such as paint chips, may contain lead or other toxic substances and eating them can lead to poisoning, increasing the child's risk of complications including learning disabilities and brain damage. This is the most concerning and potentially lethal side effect of pica Eating non-food objects can interfere with eating healthy food, which can lead to nutritional deficiencies. Eating objects that cannot be digested, such as stones, can cause constipation or blockages in the digestive tract, including the intestines and bowels. Also, hard or sharp objects (such as paperclips or metal scraps) can cause tears in the lining of the esophagus or intestines.

It helps you move better and may relieve pain. The goal of physical therapy is to make daily tasks and activities easier. For example, it may help with walking, going up stairs, or getting in and out of bed. Your doctor may suggest physical therapy for injuries or long-term health problems such as arthritis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Physical therapy may be used alone or with other treatments. Your physical therapist will examine you and talk to you about your symptoms and your daily activity. Your physical therapist also may use manual therapy, education, and techniques such as heat, cold, water, ultrasound, and electrical stimulation. Physical therapy almost always includes exercise. Your physical therapist may teach you an exercise program so you can do it at home. This is normal, but talk to your physical therapist if it bothers you. You'll want a therapist who has experience with your health problem. Some physical therapists are board-certified in areas such as orthopedics, sports, and neurology and may offer more specialized care.

Getting more fit, even a little bit, can improve your health. A brisk half-hour walk every day can help you reach a good level of fitness. And if this is hard for you, you can work toward a level of fitness that helps you feel better and have more energy. You'll feel more able to do things like playing with your kids, gardening, dancing, or biking. When you stay active and fit, you burn more calories, even when you're at rest. Being fit lets you do more physical activity. Improving your fitness is good for your heart, lungs, bones, muscles, and joints. And it lowers your risk for falls, heart attack, diabetes, high blood pressure, and some cancers. If you already have one or more of these problems, getting more fit may help you control other health problems and make you feel better. Being more fit also can help you to sleep better, handle stress better, and keep your mind sharp. Experts say your goal should be one, or a combination, of these: Do some sort of moderate aerobic activity, like brisk walking, for at least 21/2 hours each week. It is up to you how many days you want to exercise, but it is best to be active at least 3 days a week. Be active for at least 10 minutes at a time. For example, you could: Take a 10-minute walk 3 times a day. Take a half-hour walk 3 days a week. On the other 4 days take a 15-minute walk. Take a 45-minute walk every other day. Take a 10-minute walk 3 times a day. Take a half-hour walk 3 days a week. On the other 4 days take a 15-minute walk. Take a 45-minute walk every other day. Or do more vigorous activities, like running, for at least 11/4 hours a week. This activity makes you breathe harder and have a much faster heartbeat than when you are resting. It is better to be active at least 3 days a week for at least 10 minutes at a time. For example, you could: Run for 25 minutes 3 times a week. Run for 15 minutes 5 times a week. Run for 25 minutes 3 times a week. Run for 15 minutes 5 times a week. Here's an easy way to tell if your exercise is moderate: You're at a moderate level of activity if you can talk but not sing during the activity. If you can't talk while you're doing the activity, you're working too hard. Encourage your child (age 6 to 17) to do moderate to vigorous activity at least 1 hour every day. The activities you choose depend on which kind of fitness you want to improve. There are three different kinds of fitness: Aerobic fitness makes you breathe faster and makes your heart work harder for a while. Aerobic activities include walking, running, cycling, and swimming. Aerobic fitness is also called cardio or cardiovascular training. Activities like weight lifting and push-ups can improve your muscular fitness. Flexibility is the ability to move your joints and muscles through their full range of motion. But it's always a good idea to talk to your doctor before becoming more active, especially if you haven't been very active or have health problems. If you're ready to add more physical activity to your life, here are some tips to get you started: Make physical activity part of your regular day.

Sexual abuse is any sexual contact between an adult and a child or between an older child and a younger child. Showing pornography to a child is a type of sexual abuse. Child neglect is just as serious as abuse and is more common. Children often believe that abuse or neglect is their fault. They may think that they did something wrong and deserve what happened. If you don't know who to call, a hospital may be able to tell you. Many of them have special programs to deal with child abuse and neglect. If a child is in immediate danger or has been badly hurt, don't wait. If it is your own child, get him or her to a safe place and stay there.

If you're afraid to talk to the person, make a specific plan for how you will protect your children if you think abuse is about to happen or has happened. Know who you will call and where you and your children will go. To protect your child from abuse: Listen to your child. Let him or her know it is safe to talk about anything with you. Get to know your child's friends and their families. Find out what they know about child health, child development, and child care. Teach your child the difference between \"good touches\" and \"bad touches.\" Learn healthy ways to manage stress. Having a history of being abused increases your chances of becoming an abuser. You can talk to a counselor for free without giving your name. To help other children: Learn to recognize the signs of abuse and neglect. For example, a child may not grow as expected, may be dirty or unhealthy, or may seem fearful, anxious, or depressed. Know the names of your neighbors and their children.

Normally, glycogen is metabolized into a simple sugar known as glucose. When there is excess glycogen, it is stored in the body, primarily in the liver and muscles and, when the body needs more energy, is eventually converted into glucose. Because individuals with GSD-IX cannot properly break down glycogen, excess amounts accumulate in the liver, muscles, or both. GSD-IX is sometimes categorized into a liver form (caused by phosphorylase kinase deficiency in the liver, or liver and muscle) and muscle form, which is rare and is caused by phosphorylase kinase deficiency in the muscle only. Common symptoms of the liver form include abnormal enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly), unusually low levels of blood glucose (hypoglycemia) during fasting, and growth delays. The liver form of GSD-IX is inherited in either an X-linked or autosomal recessive manner and can be caused by a mutation in one of three different genes. Introduction GSD-IX is part of a larger group of disorders in which the body cannot metabolize glycogen into glucose (glycogen storage diseases). GSD-IX was first described in the medical literature in 1966 by Dr. They reported on a young girl with phosphorylase kinase deficiency of the liver that was consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance.

Research has greatly improved our understanding of the diseases that cause PAP and how to identify (diagnose) and treat them. Diseases that cause PAP can occur in men, women, and children of all ages, ethnic backgrounds, and geographic locations. Thus, it is important to know which disease is causing PAP in order to determine the best therapy and expected treatment response.

A specific phobia, formerly called a simple phobia, is a lasting and unreasonable fear caused by the presence or thought of a specific object or situation that usually poses little or no actual danger. Exposure to the object or situation brings about an immediate reaction, causing the person to endure intense anxiety (nervousness) or to avoid the object or situation entirely. The distress associated with the phobia and/or the need to avoid the object or situation can significantly interfere with the person's ability to function. Adults with a specific phobia recognize that the fear is excessive or unreasonable, yet are unable to overcome it. There are different types of specific phobias, based on the object or situation feared, including: Animal phobias: Examples include the fear of dogs, snakes, insects, or mice. Situational phobias: These involve a fear of specific situations, such as flying, riding in a car or on public transportation, driving, going over bridges or in tunnels, or of being in a closed-in place, like an elevator. Blood-injection-injury phobias: These involve a fear of being injured, of seeing blood or of invasive medical procedures, such as blood tests or injections Other phobias: These include a fear of falling down, a fear of loud sounds, and a fear of costumed characters, such as clowns. Symptoms of specific phobias may include: Excessive or irrational fear of a specific object or situation Avoiding the object or situation or enduring it with great distress Physical symptoms of anxiety or a panic attack, such as a pounding heart, nausea or diarrhea, sweating, trembling or shaking, numbness or tingling, problems with breathing (shortness of breath), feeling dizzy or lightheaded, feeling like you are choking Anticipatory anxiety, which involves becoming nervous ahead of time about being in certain situations or coming into contact with the object of your phobia; for example, a person with a fear of dogs may become anxious about going for a walk because he or she may see a dog along the way. The exact cause of specific phobias is not known, but most appear to be associated with a traumatic experience or a learned reaction. For example, a person who has a frightening or threatening experience with an animal, such as an attack or being bitten, can develop a specific phobia. Witnessing a traumatic event in which others experience harm or extreme fear can also cause a specific phobia, as can receiving information or repeated warnings about potentially dangerous situations or animals. If symptoms of a specific phobia are present, the doctor will begin an evaluation by performing a medical and psychiatric history and may perform a brief physical exam. Although there are no lab tests to specifically diagnose specific phobias, the doctor may use various tests to make sure that a physical illness isn't the cause of the symptoms. The doctor bases his or her diagnosis of specific phobias on reported symptoms, including any problems with functioning caused by the symptoms. A specific phobia is diagnosed if the person's fear and anxiety are particularly distressing or if they interfere with his or her daily routine, including school, work, social activities, and relationships. Treatment for specific phobias may include one or a combination of: Cognitive behavioral therapy : Psychotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment for specific phobias. Treatment usually involves a type of cognitive behavioral therapy, called systematic desensitization or exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy, in which patients are gradually exposed to what frightens them until their fear begins to fade. Medication : For situational phobias that produce intense, temporary anxiety (for example, a fear of flying), short-acting sedative-hypnotics (benzodiazepines) such as Ativan, or Xanax may be prescribed on an occasional, as-needed basis to help reduce anticipatory anxiety. Although many specific phobias cannot be prevented, early intervention and treatment following a traumatic experience, such as an animal attack, may prevent the person from developing a severe anxiety disorder."], [495, "Phenytoin Embryopathy", "The symptoms of this disorder may include abnormalities of the skull and facial features, growth deficiencies, underdeveloped nails of the fingers and toes, and/or mild developmental delays.

If PKU is not treated, phenylalanine can build up in the blood and lead to intellectual disability and problems with the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). Babies born with PKU need to start treatment with special formula soon after birth. For a baby to have the disease, he or she must get (inherit) the PKU gene from both parents. If a baby gets the gene from only one parent, he or she is a carrier of the PKU gene but does not have the disease. If you have a child with PKU and are thinking about having another baby, you may want to get genetic counseling. If you have a family history of PKU, talk with your doctor about genetic testing if you want to find out whether you carry the gene. If PKU is not found and treated soon after birth, symptoms usually start to appear within a few months after birth. Early symptoms of PKU in a baby may include: A musty odor to the skin, hair, and urine. Screening is recommended for all newborns within a few days after birth.1 If the PKU screening test shows that your baby has a phenylalanine problem, the doctor will do further testing to check whether your baby has PKU. Problems are less likely to occur if your baby starts a PKU diet by age 3 weeks. Your baby's doctor can help you choose a formula that doesn't contain phenylalanine. You may be able to feed your baby some breast milk, but talk to your baby's doctor first. As your child gets older, a registered dietitian can help you choose the right foods and recipes. With or without the medicine, your child still needs to follow a PKU diet. It's normal to feel a wide range of emotions when your child has an illness like PKU. For a few people, treatment with sapropterin (Kuvan) may help when used with a PKU diet. If the level builds up, it can affect your IQ and your ability to learn, think, and understand. Any woman with PKU who is planning to have a baby needs to be very careful to control her phenylalanine levels. Babies born to mothers who have high levels of phenylalanine are at risk for having a very small head, intellectual disability, growth problems, and heart problems. Having regular blood tests and following the PKU diet before and during pregnancy can help protect the baby."], [497, "Pick Disease of the Brain", "Pick's disease is a kind of dementia similar to Alzheimer's but far less common.

When you have Pick's disease, the tau proteins don't work the way they should. The track is no longer straight, and nutrients in the brain can't get where they need to go. This causes brain damage that can't be reversed. Around 50,000 to 60,000 people in the U.S. have Pick's disease. It's usually diagnosed between the ages of 40 and 75, but it can happen in people as young as 20. Up to 25% of people with Pick's disease received a gene that causes it from a parent.

Unlike people with Alzheimer's disease, people with Pick's disease: Are diagnosed earlier in life Don't have hallucinations or delusions Don't tend to get lost in familiar places Have a harder time making sense of their words or the words of others Have behavior problems early on (behavior problems usually come late in Alzheimer's) Don't have as many memory loss problems To find out if you have Pick's disease, your doctor will ask about your symptoms and go over your medical history. Then you'll have special tests that check your memory, behavior, language, and other mental functions. The doctor may also recommend a blood test that looks at your DNA to see if you have the gene that causes Pick's disease. To get a better picture of what's happening in your brain, your doctor may order imaging tests, such as: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Powerful magnets and radio waves are used to make detailed images of your brain. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or a positron emission tomography (PET) scan: A radioactive substance and a special camera create 3-dimensional pictures that show what areas of your brain are more or less active.

Common symptoms include the formation of stones throughout the urinary tract (urolithiasis) and kidneys (nephrolithiasis) and progressively increased levels of calcium in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis), although this last finding has not been identified in individuals with PH type III as of yet. Chronic, recurrent stone formation and the accumulation of calcium oxalate in kidney tissue can cause chronic kidney disease, which can ultimately progress to kidney failure (end stage renal disease [ESRD]).

So it's a good idea to learn about your risks and how to protect yourself and other people. People who are most in need of protection are children under age 5, pregnant women, and people with weak immune systems. Washing your hands well may be all you need to do to prevent infection from some animals. It could be a pet, an animal at a farm or a petting zoo, or a wild animal that passes infection on to you. It's not just touching an animal that can expose you to bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites. Touch feces or urine from an animal. Are licked, scratched, or bitten by an animal. Before you travel, learn about common animal-borne infection risks where you're going. De-worm pets, especially puppies and kittens. Wash or change your pet's bedding regularly. If you have no soap and water, use a gel hand sanitizer or alcohol-based hand wipe containing 60% to 90% ethyl alcohol or isopropanol. Change and wash your clothes as soon as you come back home from handling animals at a petting zoo or farm. Clean up carefully after an animal has vomited or had diarrhea. Use disinfectant to clean all hard surfaces that have been soiled. In general, wash your hands before you eat and after you prepare food. Use rubber gloves and a spray disinfectant. To lower your risk of getting a disease from an animal: Avoid touching animal feces or urine. Avoid touching an animal, then touching your face, food, or other things you'll touch later, such as a phone or a wallet. Don't let an animal lick your mouth or face. If you need to touch or move an injured or dead animal, wear gloves. Avoid touching dirt or sand where feces are likely to have been. Wearing shoes and gloves helps protect you. At a petting zoo or farm, avoid pacifier use. Help with thorough hand-washing right after a child touches or handles an animal. Do not allow children to handle turtles, baby chicks or ducklings, or other small pets. Young children tend to kiss or lick these types of animals. Some children may even try to swallow the smallest turtles and could choke. Teach children to avoid animals they don't know and to always ask for permission before going near someone else's animal. Even pets that seem to be healthy can spread disease. Campylobacter and cryptosporidium, which cause diarrhea, cramping, stomach pain, fever, and vomiting. You can be infected when you handle feces from a dog, a cat, or a farm animal. Hookworms and roundworms, which can cause stomach pain, bleeding, swelling, diarrhea, and sometimes painful skin irritation. You can get these tiny worms from animal feces. Rabies, which can affect the brain and spinal cord. It is nearly always fatal if not treated before symptoms appear. Salmonellosis, which causes diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps. Toxoplasmosis can be dangerous for a pregnant woman's developing baby (fetus) and for someone with a weak immune system. Q Fever can cause flu-like illness, diarrhea, vomiting, and chest or stomach pain. You can be infected by unpasteurized milk or cheese, or undercooked meat from an infected animal. Herd animals on the farm and in the wild can be infected. Hunters and animal handlers beware-you can also breath in the bacteria when you handle infected meat, hides, or wool. Hantavirus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCMV) can cause serious illness. LCMV is also dangerous for a pregnant woman's fetus. Rabies is nearly always fatal if it's not treated before symptoms appear. You can be infected if you get scratched or bitten by an infected wild animal. When you're pregnant, be extra careful around animals, foods from animals, and animal waste. Protect your unborn baby from dangerous infections from animals or animal products. Stay clear of possible sources of lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCMV) and toxoplasmosis. Ask someone else to do the cleaning. If you have to clean, wear gloves and a face mask.

Individuals often feel as if the room is moving or spinning and they can lose their balance and have difficulty standing or walking. BPPV is most often triggered by rapid, sometimes unexpected changes in head position. In some cases, it only causes mild symptoms, while in others it can potentially cause more severe, even debilitating symptoms. BPPV is believed to be caused by the displacement of small calcium carbonate crystals within the inner ear. These tiny crystals become dislodged from their normal location and fall into one of three semicircular canals, which are tiny, interconnected, looped tubes that can detect movements of the head and that play a role in helping the body maintain balance. The treatment maneuvers remove the calcium but do not prevent the shedding of additional calcium crystals in the future. Although labeled benign, BPPV can disrupt a person's daily activities and affect quality of life. The term paroxysmal means that episodes arise suddenly and often unpredictably.

Hyperparathyroidism happens when they don't make enough parathyroid hormone (PTH), are surgically removed, are damaged or when your body is resistant to that hormone. PTH controls the blood level of important vitamins and minerals such as vitamin D and calcium. You may also have hypoparathyroidism because you have another condition that affects how much PTH is in your body, such as a low magnesium level. Your body uses calcium to keep your nerves, muscles, and heart working. Low levels of calcium can result in symptoms ranging from mild to severe muscle spasms, tingling, heart problems, and seizures. Treatment mostly means making sure your body has enough calcium and vitamin D, which you can do by eating a balanced diet, taking supplements, and keeping an eye on blood levels. If you stick with your treatment plan and see your doctor regularly, you can lead a full, active life with hypoparathyroidism. They include: Injury or removal of the glands during surgery Autoimmune diseases Radiation therapy to your neck or head Low levels of magnesium Genetic disorders Some of the symptoms of low blood calcium are: Muscle cramps or spasms in your legs, feet, lower back, or face Tingling in your fingers, toes, or lips Anxiety and depression Heart failure An irregular heartbeat Low blood pressure Seizures Low calcium in the long term can lead to: Cataracts Dental problems Movement disorders like tremors Hair loss and brittle nails Your doctor will test your blood and your urine for calcium, PTH, phosphorus, and magnesium. If your child has the disease, ask her doctor how you can make sure she gets the nutrients she needs to grow. Calcium and vitamin D supplements can keep hypoparathyroidism in check. Your doctor may tell you to: Limit foods with phosphates, like soda and other fizzy drinks. Eat foods high in calcium such as low-fat dairy products, dark green vegetables like collard greens and kale, and foods with added calcium like some cereals and orange juices. A dietitian can help you plan meals to keep you or your child healthy. If normal calcium levels in your body are hard to maintain, you may need to get an injection of PTH. Once your calcium levels are normal again, you can go back to your regular treatment. That makes it easier for your body to digest vitamins and minerals. As long as you get enough calcium and vitamin D and have your blood checked regularly, you should be able to keep your hypoparathyroidism under control. If you don't take your daily supplement and watch your diet, the condition can be dangerous.

It may take some planning, but plenty of people who have it find ways to do all the things they love, just as they did before they were diagnosed. Having pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) means that you have high blood pressure in the arteries that go from your heart to your lungs . With PAH, the tiny arteries in your lungs become narrow or blocked. It's harder for blood to flow through them, and that raises the blood pressure in your lungs. Your heart has to work harder to pump blood through those arteries, and after a while the heart muscle gets weak. Sometimes doctors can't find a reason for high blood pressure in the lungs. In that case, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. Genes may play a role in why some people get it. In other cases, there is another condition that's causing the problem. Any of these illnesses can lead to high blood pressure in your lungs: Congestive heart failure Blood clots in the lungs HIV Illegal drug use (like cocaine or methamphetamine) Liver disease (such as cirrhosis of the liver) Lupus, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases A heart defect you're born with Lung diseases like emphysema, chronic bronchitis, or pulmonary fibrosis Sleep apnea You may not notice any symptoms for a while. You may notice that you can't do some of the things you used to without getting winded. Other symptoms include: Chest pain Fatigue Passing out Swelling in your ankles and legs If you have shortness of breath and see your doctor, he will ask you about your medical history. Your doctor may order tests, including: Echocardiogram: This ultrasound picture of the beating heart can check blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. Ventilation-perfusion scan (V/Q scan): This test can help find blood clots that can cause high blood pressure in the lungs. Electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG): An EKG traces the heart's activity and can show whether the right side of the heart is under strain. Chest X-ray: An X-ray can show if your arteries or heart are enlarged. Chest X-rays can help find other lung or heart conditions that may be causing the problems. Exercise testing: Your doctor may want you to run on a treadmill or ride a stationary bike while you are hooked up to a monitor, so he can see any changes in your oxygen levels, heart function, lung pressure, or other things. Your doctor may also do blood tests to check for HIV and conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. If these tests show that you might have pulmonary hypertension, your doctor will need to do a right heart catheterization to be sure. Here's what happens during that test: The doctor places a catheter into a large vein, most often the jugular vein in your neck or femoral vein in your leg, and then threads it into the right side of your heart. The doctor may also inject medicines into the catheter to see if the pulmonary arteries are stiff. The doctor will give you a sedative and use local anesthesia. You may want to write down a list of questions before your appointment, so you can make sure you ask your doctor everything you want to. It can also help to have a friend or family member with you to help you get the answers you want. Pulmonary hypertension varies from person to person, so your treatment plan will be specific to your needs. First, your doctor will treat the cause of your condition. For example, if emphysema is causing the problem, you'll need to treat that to improve your pulmonary hypertension. Oxygen therapy, when you breathe pure oxygen through prongs that fit in your nose, will help if you're short of breath and have low oxygen levels in your blood. If you are at risk for blood clots your doctor will recommend blood thinners. Other medicines improve how well your heart works and keep fluid from building up in your body. If you have severe pulmonary hypertension, your doctor may prescribe medications called calcium channel blockers. These medicines lower blood pressure in the lungs and the rest of the body. If calcium channel blockers aren't enough, your doctor may refer you to a specialized treatment center. You may need more targeted therapies that can open up your narrowed blood vessels. They may be pills, medicines you breathe in, or drugs that are given through an IV. Options include: Pills: ambrisentan (Letairis), bocentan (Tracleer), macitentan (Opsumit), riociguat (Adempas), selexipag (Uptravi), sildenafil (Revatio), tadalafil (Adcirca), treprostinil (Orenitram) Inhalers: Iloprost tromethamine (Ventavis), treprostinil (Tyvaso) IV drugs: epopostenol sodium (Flolan, Veletri), treprostinil In more severe cases, or if medicines don't help, your doctor may recommend a lung transplant or a procedure called atrial septostomy. One of the best things you can do for yourself is to stay active, even if you have shortness of breath. Regular exercise, like taking a walk, will help you breathe better and live better. Talk to your doctor first to find out what kind of exercise is best for you, and how much you should do. If you have idiopathic pulmonary hypertension -- the kind where doctors can't find a cause -- your symptoms will get worse over time."], [511, "Paramyotonia Congenita of Von Eulenburg", "When your child has a primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD), his body has a harder time fighting germs that make people sick. He may get a lot of infections in his ears, lungs, skin, or other areas that take a long time to go away. There are many different types -- more than 200 -- and they affect different parts of the immune system. If your child has it, in most cases he'll be able to go to school and make friends like other kids. As an adult with a PIDD, he'll be able to work and have an active, normal life. If your child's PIDD is mild, he may need to take medicines to treat the infections he gets. Doctors treat some of the more serious types of PIDD with doses of antibodies to fight infections. The treatment takes several hours, and he'll need one every few weeks. Some severe forms of PIDD may need even more serious treatment: a bone marrow transplant, which has a long recovery time. When you first learn that your child has a PIDD, you might worry that infections are going to rage out of control. But there are lots of treatments that can keep symptoms in check and help your child stay healthy and active. Talk to your doctor about how to meet other families who have faced PIDDs, too. You can't catch PIDDs like you can a cold or the flu. Some people with PIDDs are missing certain types of white blood cells, or those cells don't work very well. If that's true for your child, he's more likely to get sick from infections that wouldn't take hold in someone else. He may get a lot of serious infections, or his illness may start out as a common cold but turn into bronchitis or pneumonia. Signs that your child may have a PIDD include: Has four or more infections a year in the ears, lungs, skin, eyes, mouth, or private parts Needs to get antibiotics through an IV for infections Gets more than one severe, fast-moving illness, like septicemia, a bacterial infection of the blood Has thrush (a fungal infection in the mouth) that doesn't go away Antibiotics don't work well Gets pneumonia more than once a year Your doctor will do a physical exam and may ask you questions like: Has your child had a lot of severe infections? Does your child stay sick even after taking antibiotics? Do other people in your family tend to get sick a lot? Your doctor may also want your child to get some blood tests. Some tests will count the number of white blood cells that your child's body has. Many states now test newborns for the most severe kind of PIDD, called SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency). Infections are going to happen, but treatments can take care of symptoms so your child can get well ASAP and get back to doing his favorite things. He may need to get higher doses of infection-fighting medications and take them for a longer time. If an infection is serious, your child might need to get antibiotics put into his veins through an IV. Even if he's not sick now, your doctor may give him antibiotics or other medicines to prevent an illness. Your doctor may also suggest treatments that can make your child's immune system work better: Immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement therapy. The antibodies only last so long, so your child may need a treatment every 3 or 4 weeks. It's rare, but for a very severe PIDD, your child could need a stem cell transplant. Your child will need to find someone who is the right match so that his body accepts the new cells. If no one you know is a match, you can put your child on a waiting list. During the transplant, your child will get the new stem cells through an IV. It could take 2 to 6 weeks for the new stem cells to multiply and start making healthy, working blood cells. During this time, your child may need to stay in the hospital or, at the very least, make visits every day to get checked by his transplant team. It can take 6 months to a year until the number of good blood cells in his body gets up to normal. Even with a PIDD, your child will be able to go to school, make friends, and keep up with activities. You'll want to meet with his teachers to explain his condition and to let them know he may need to miss classes because of illness more often than other kids. Make exercise a habit, and see that he gets plenty of sleep, too. The most severe forms of the disease may be treated, and possibly cured, with stem cell transplants, although that's not an easy process. When your child has this illness, the whole family will need lots of emotional support from people like friends, extended family members, and neighbors. Talk to your doctor about getting in touch with other families who have a child with a severe PIDD and can understand what it's like. The web site of the Immune Deficiency Foundation can help you find a doctor or get in touch with a support group. Trials are a way for people to try medicines that aren't available to everyone.

The fertilized egg stays in the fallopian tube for 3 or 4 days before it heads to the uterus. But if the fertilized egg implants in your fallopian tube or somewhere else in your abdomen, you end up with what's called an ectopic pregnancy. Most of the time, an ectopic pregnancy happens within the first few weeks of pregnancy. You might not even know you're pregnant and may not have signs of a problem. Light vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain are usually the first symptoms, but others could include: Nausea and vomiting with pain Sharp abdominal cramps Pain on one side of your body Dizziness or weakness Pain in your shoulder, neck, or rectum Ectopic pregnancy can lead to fallopian tube rupture. If that happens, you could have major pain and severe bleeding. It could prevent the fertilized egg from getting into your uterus, leaving it to implant in the fallopian tube or somewhere else. But you are more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy if you have any of the following: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Sexually-transmitted diseases Scarring from previous pelvic surgeries History of ectopic pregnancy Unsuccessful tubal ligation or tubal ligation reversal Use of fertility drugs Infertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) It could also happen if you become pregnant with an intrauterine device (IUD) in place. If your doctor thinks you have an ectopic pregnancy, she will probably perform some tests, including a pregnancy test and a pelvic exam. If she confirms you have an ectopic pregnancy, she will talk to you about the best treatment based on your medical condition and your future plans for pregnancy. Because a fertilized egg can't survive outside of the uterus, the tissue has to be removed to keep you from having serious complications. Two methods are used to treat it: medication and surgery. If your fallopian tube hasn't ruptured and your pregnancy hasn't progressed very far, your doctor can give you an injection of methotrexate (Trexall). Most ectopic pregnancies can be treated with methotrexate if they're caught early. Your doctor will make very small incisions in your lower abdomen and insert a thin, flexible instrument (laparoscope) to remove the ectopic pregnancy. If your fallopian tube is damaged, she may have to remove it as well.If you're bleeding heavily or your doctor suspects your fallopian tube is ruptured, you might need emergency surgery with a larger incision.

After a trauma, it's common to struggle with fear, anxiety, and sadness. You may have upsetting memories or find it hard to sleep. But if you have PTSD, these thoughts and feelings don't fade away. They last for months and years, and may even get worse. PTSD causes problems in your daily life, such as in relationships and at work. During a trauma, your body responds to a threat by going into \"flight or fight\" mode. It releases stress hormones, like adrenaline and norepinephrine, to give you a burst of energy. Your brain also puts some of its normal tasks, such as filing short-term memories, on pause. Your body continues to send out stress signals, which lead to PTSD symptoms. Studies show that the part of the brain that handles fear and emotion (the amygdala) is more active in people with PTSD. Over time, PTSD changes your brain. The area that controls your memory (the hippocampus) becomes smaller. You might also avoid things that remind you of the event, and lose interest in things that you enjoy. Without treatment, you can have PTSD for years or even the rest of your life. For example, a news report about an assault on television may trigger overwhelming memories of your own assault. PTSD interferes with your life. This can lead to problems in your relationships with friends, family, and coworkers. In fact, studies show that it raises your risk of heart disease and digestive disorders. Women have double the risk of PTSD. They also blame themselves for a traumatic event more than men do.

Pompe disease happens when your body can't make a protein that breaks down a complex sugar, called glycogen, for energy. Too much sugar builds up and damages your muscles and organs. Pompe disease causes muscle weakness and trouble breathing. You might hear Pompe disease called by other names such as GAA deficiency or type II glycogen storage disease (GSD). Although it can happen to anyone, it's more common in African-American people and some Asian groups. You get Pompe disease from your parents. You can have one gene and not have symptoms of the disease. What symptoms you have, when they start, and how much trouble they are can be very different for different people.

You might notice: Feeling weak in the legs, trunk, and arms Shortness of breath, a hard time exercising, and lung infections Trouble breathing while you sleep A big curve in your spine Enlarged liver Enlarged tongue that makes it hard to chew and swallow Stiff joints Many symptoms are similar to other medical conditions. To help figure out what's going on, your doctor may ask: Do you feel weak, fall often, or have trouble walking, running, climbing stairs, or standing up? Does or did anyone else in your family have troubles like these, too? If your doctor thinks you might have Pompe disease, it's often confirmed with these tests: Check a sample of muscle to see how much glycogen there is Check a blood sample to see how well the \"bad\" protein is working Look for the genetic problem that causes Pompe disease It can take about 3 months to diagnose Pompe disease in a baby.

It's rare, but the swelling from angioedema can happen in your throat and cause trouble breathing. If that happens, use an auto-injector and call 911. Common triggers for hives include: Foods like milk, fish, or nuts Drugs like aspirin or penicillin Food additives like flavorings and preservatives Bug bites Extreme cold or heat Pressure on the skin Viral infections Skin contact with allergens There's one surefire way: Figure out what's causing them and stay away from it. If over-the-counter medicine doesn't help or your hives won't go away, see your doctor. At home, try these tips: Apply cool compresses or wet cloths to the hives."], [517, "Panniculitis, Idiopathic Nodular", "If you have it, your immune system attacks red blood cells in your body and breaks them down. You can get paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) at any age. Although it can be life-threatening, treatments can help you feel better and control some of its complications. The biggest risk is blood clots. About 40% of people with PNH have one at some point. But you don't get it from your parents, and you can't pass it on to your kids. A change in a gene, called a mutation, causes your body to make abnormal red blood cells. People with a certain type of anemia, called aplastic anemia, are more likely to get PNH. The reverse is also true: People with PNH are more likely to get aplastic anemia, though not everyone does. In this condition, your bone marrow stops making new blood cells. The condition gets its name from one of its symptoms: dark or bright red blood in your urine at night or in the morning. \"Paroxysmal\" means \"sudden,\" \"nocturnal\" means \"at night,\" and \"hemoglobinuria\" means \"blood in the urine.\" It happens in over 60% of people with PNH. Symptoms of the disease are caused by: Broken red blood cells Too few red blood cells (which can cause anemia) Blood clots in your veins You could have many symptoms or just a few. Usually, the more of the faulty blood cells you have in your body, the more the condition will affect you. Broken red blood cells and anemia may make you: Feel tired and weak Have headaches Feel short of breath Have an irregular heartbeat Have belly pain Have trouble swallowing Have pale or yellowish skin Bruise easily Men may have trouble getting or keeping an erection The symptoms of blood clots depend on where the clot happens: Skin : Red, painful, or swollen area Arm or leg: Sore, warm, and swollen limb Stomach : Pain Ulcers and bleeding Brain : Bad headache with or without vomiting Seizures Trouble moving, talking, or seeing Lungs : Trouble breathing Sharp chest pain Coughing up blood Sweating Blood clots can be dangerous. If you think you may have one, call your doctor right away. Call 911 if you have any trouble breathing, feel like you are going to pass out, or have a seizure. Your doctor will ask about your medical history and any symptoms you've noticed. He may also ask you: Have you noticed blood in your urine? Have you had any stomach or digestive problems? Have you been tested for aplastic anemia or a bone marrow disorder? One will count of the number of blood cells you have. You will probably also get other tests, such as flow cytometry, which checks on whether your red blood cells have the proteins that should protect them. Your doctor may also check your iron levels or get a sample of your bone marrow. If you have symptoms of a blood clot, he'll use other tests to look for those, too. You're probably going to have a lot of things to ask about. Use this list to help you get the information you need. Your treatment will depend on how severe your symptoms and disease are. If you have only a few symptoms from anemia, you may need: Folic acid to help your bone marrow make more normal blood cells Iron supplements to make more red blood cells Other treatments include: Blood transfusions. These help treat anemia, the most common PNH problem. These medicines make your blood less likely to clot. The only drug approved to treat PNH, it prevents the breakdown of red blood cells. This can improve anemia, lower or stop the need for blood transfusions, and reduce blood clots. It can make you more likely to get a meningitis infection, so you may need to get a meningitis vaccine. To get one, you'll need someone healthy, usually a brother or sister, to donate stem cells to replace the ones in your bone marrow. If your doctor thinks it would work for you, talk with him about the risks and benefits. If your PNH doesn't get better with usual treatments, you may want to ask your doctor if you can take part in a clinical trial. Ask your doctor what's involved and what you should consider before you sign up. When you have PNH, it's even more important to take good care of yourself, so you feel your best. Your body absorbs iron better when you get it with vitamin C. Try combos like iron-fortified cereal with strawberries or spinach salad with orange slices. If your red blood cell count is very low, skip activities that make your heart beat faster, hurt your chest, or strain your breathing. Tell your doctor if you have a fever or feel more tired than usual. If you're a woman who wants to get pregnant, talk to your doctor first. PNH can cause problems that make pregnancy risky for you and your baby. If you do become pregnant, your doctors will closely follow how you and the baby are doing. It's OK to feel anger, sadness, or stress after your diagnosis. You may find that it helps to talk with a counselor, especially if those feelings start to affect your daily life. You may also want to consider joining a support group, where you can talk with other people who understand what you're going through because they've been there, too. Your friends and family will want to know what's going on with you and what they can do for you. It's hard to predict if you'll have milder or more serious symptoms, or if you'll develop other conditions. The disease can also make you more likely to have other blood-related conditions like aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). MDS is a group of bone marrow diseases in which you have trouble making normal blood cells. The Aplastic Anemia &amp; MDS International Foundation can help you connect with other people who have PNH and find the services you need."], [518, "Paraplegia, Hereditary Spastic Other Conditions", "If you have psoriasis, you may have other health problems, too. White blood cells that usually fight infection get activated by mistake, and that triggers inflammation. People who have psoriasis seem likely to have other conditions linked to inflammation like heart disease, diabetes, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and metabolic syndrome. Mild or moderate psoriasis usually is treated with medicines you put on your skin. But if your psoriasis is severe, you may need drugs that change the way your immune system works. Your doctor should know about any other health problems you have and any medicines you take. If your natural infection-fighting system is weak because of certain diseases (such as HIV) or medications (such as chemotherapy), it can be dangerous to take drugs that affect your immune system. Those include cyclosporine, methotrexate, biologics (drugs made from living cells), and systemic drugs (ones that work throughout your body). Treating it can lower your risk, but some medications can hurt more than they help. People with congestive heart failure shouldn't take certain biologics, including etanercept (Enbrel), adalimumab (Humira), and infliximab (Remicade). Psoriasis can make you more likely to get type 2 diabetes, especially if your skin disease is serious. There's some evidence that taking biologic drugs for psoriasis may help your body respond to insulin. And certain drugs that treat diabetes -- thiazolidinedione (Actos, Avandia) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (Victoza, Trulicity) -- may also help your psoriasis. But steroids can raise your blood sugar and even lead to type 2 diabetes if you take them for a long time. In some cases, topical steroid medicine also may cause blood sugar problems. Follow your doctor's instructions about how much to use and for how long. Severe psoriasis makes you more likely to have chronic kidney disease, and some of the same drugs that treat the skin disease can damage those organs. If you have kidney problems, you shouldn't take cyclosporine, methotrexate, or acitretin, and you should take a smaller-than-normal dose of apremilast (Otezla). So you shouldn't take systemic psoriasis drugs if you're getting cancer treatment. People with skin cancer also should avoid light therapy, which exposes your skin to ultraviolet rays. Psoriasis may make you more likely to have certain kinds of cancer, like lymphoma and skin cancer. Systemic drugs also appear to raise your risk of these. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis may have a connection to psoriasis. One study found that 1 in 10 women with psoriasis also has a form of inflammatory bowel disease. Two of the biologic drugs used to treat psoriasis can cause these illnesses or make them worse. If you're affected by this, talk with your doctor before you try secukinumab (Cosentyx) or ixekizumab (Talz). When you take a drug that slows down your immune system, like cyclosporine, methotrexate, or biologic drugs, your body can't fight off infection like it normally would. Many antibiotics that treat infections shouldn't be taken with systemic drugs. Either way, your doctor probably will be very careful in treating your psoriasis while you're pregnant. Biologic drugs haven't been studied in pregnant women, so talk with your doctor about them. Don't take cyclosporine, methotrexate, or apremilast while you're nursing, and don't use steroid creams on your breasts. But one psoriasis medication, apremilast, may make depression worse."], [519, "Paraplegia, Hereditary Spastic Living With", "But some of the worst effects of psoriasis are emotional. You may feel like your psoriasis gets in the way of your relationships. Even your good friends may refuse your offers to help them out in the kitchen by chopping vegetables. \"Unfortunately, people's ignorance of this disease is hard to overcome,\" says Bruce E. Strober, MD, PhD, co-director of the Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Center at New York University. \"It happens all the time that people with psoriasis won't be allowed in a swimming pool, or that others will move away from them on a crowded train. Psoriasis can make you feel deeply isolated and excluded, and that can have serious psychological costs. When it's combined with the chronic discomfort that psoriasis can cause, your emotions can be difficult to handle. Coping with psoriasis can create stress, and stress can make psoriasis get worse. \"Psoriasis has a tremendous impact on quality of life,\" says Strober. He says studies have shown that psoriasis detracts more from quality of life than any other condition except depression -- and that's including life-threatening illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes. A 2009 National Psoriasis Foundation survey found that 63% of respondents said their condition affected their emotional well-being. While it might seem like great advice to ignore other people's reactions to your psoriasis, that's not realistic for most people. One thing that might help is to try to explain psoriasis to other people. Educating people, of course, isn't practical in every casual situation. If you feel like your psoriasis is detracting from your life and making you miserable, try to seek professional help. If possible, find a therapist who's treated people with psoriasis before. Another option is to seek out a support group, either in person or on the Internet. Talking to people dealing with your condition might make you feel a lot better and less lonely. One of the best things you can do is to keep going to your doctor. Feeling depressed may make you want to give up and retreat from life, but that isn't a real option. You have to keep fighting and stay involved in your treatment. \"People with psoriasis have to know that they're not alone,\" says Jeffrey M. Weinberg, MD, director of the Clinical Research Center at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York City. \"And although we can't offer a cure at this time, we do have the options to improve it.\""], [520, "Parangi Understanding Prostate Cancer -- Symptoms", "Once a tumor causes the prostate gland to swell, or once cancer spreads beyond the prostate, the following symptoms may happen: A frequent need to urinate, especially at night Difficulty starting or stopping a stream of urine A weak or interrupted urinary stream Leaking of urine when laughing or coughing Inability to urinate standing up A painful or burning sensation during urination or ejaculation Blood in urine or semen These are not symptoms of the cancer itself; instead, they are caused by the blockage from the cancer growth in the prostate.

You and your doctor will decide on a treatment plan based on: How severe your psoriasis is What treatments you've already used Whether you have other medical conditions How much you're willing to do What insurance will cover financially Your doctor will probably first suggest that you try a preparation you apply to your skin. Topical medications include lotions, creams, ointments, shampoos, foams, and oils/solutions. You'll probably need a prescription, but some products are available over the counter. The most common ones use corticosteroids to calm inflammation. Others use salicylic acid to help remove scales. Other options you might try include: Formulas with vitamin D, including calcipotriene (Dovonex, Sorilux) and calcitriol (Rocaltrol, Vectical) Retinoids like tazarotene (Tazorac) Tar treatments such as Balnetar, Pentrax, Polytar, and Tera-Gel If your psoriasis covers more than 10% to 20% of your skin, you'll probably need more than these treatments alone. Exposing your skin to the sun or other ultraviolet light can improve your symptoms. Newer techniques use an Xtrac laser, which can target a small area of psoriatic skin with a highly focused UVB light. For psoriasis that doesn't respond to other treatments, drugs like acitretin (Soriatane), apremilast (Otezla), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), and methotrexate (Trexall) may help.

Still, you can do a lot on your own to help control and prevent flare-ups. Symptoms get worse when your skin is dry, so keep it moist with creams and lotions. Thick and oily ones, like petroleum jelly, are usually best. To help remove scales, apply cream on top of them, then cover the area with plastic wrap or another waterproof material. Take care of your skin and scalp. Never pick at patches or scales, as you may make your psoriasis worse. Use caution when trimming your nails. If you cut yourself, it might make symptoms flare. If you have psoriasis on your scalp, rub your topical treatments -- such as tar shampoos -- into your scalp. For many people, cold, dry weather makes symptoms worse. It's important to keep your skin moist. Avoid medications that cause flare-ups. Let your doctor know about all the medications you take, even over-the-counter ones.

But no matter how well you plan for their arrival, you may not be fully prepared for all of the changes your body will go through now. Knowing what to expect will help you get ready for the months ahead. Here are some of the changes you might experience, what they mean, and which signs warrant a call to your doctor. About 25% of pregnant women experience slight bleeding during their first trimester. However, if you have significant bleeding, cramping, or sharp pain in your abdomen, call your doctor. These could be signs of a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy in which the embryo implants outside of the uterus). Going up a bra size (or more) and wearing a support bra can make you feel more comfortable; you can go back to the lacy bras after your baby is finished nursing. Add to that the extra iron you're getting from your prenatal vitamin, and the result is uncomfortable constipation and gas that can keep you feeling bloated throughout your pregnancy. Increase your fiber intake and drink extra fluids to keep things moving more smoothly. If your constipation is really bothering you, talk to your doctor about what mild laxative or stool softeners are safe to use during pregnancy. It's normal to see a thin, milky white discharge (called leukorrhea) early in your pregnancy. You can wear a panty liner if it makes you feel more comfortable, but don't use a tampon because it can introduce germs into the vagina. If the discharge is foul-smelling, green, or yellow, or if there's a lot of clear discharge, call your doctor. Your body is working hard to support a growing fetus, which can wear you out more easily than usual. Take naps or rest when you need to throughout the day. Also make sure you're getting enough iron (too little can lead to anemia, which can cause excess fatigue). Although you may not want a bowl of mint chip ice cream topped with dill pickles, as the old stereotype goes, your tastes can change while you're pregnant. More than 60% of pregnant women experience food cravings, and more than half have food aversions, according to research. Giving in to cravings from time to time is OK, provided you are generally eating healthy, low-calorie foods. The exception is pica -- a craving for non-foods like clay, dirt, and laundry starch, which can be dangerous for you and your baby. If you experience this kind of craving, report it to your doctor right away. Your baby is still pretty small, but your uterus is growing and it's putting pressure on your bladder. As a result, you may feel like you constantly have to go to the bathroom. You can also try raising your pillows when you sleep. It's OK to cry, but if you're feeling overwhelmed, try to find an understanding ear -- if not from your partner, then from a friend or family member. To calm your nausea, try eating small, bland, or high-protein snacks (crackers, meat, or cheese) and sipping water, clear fruit juice (apple juice), or ginger ale. Nausea itself isn't anything to worry about, but if it persists or is severe, it can affect the amount of nutrition getting to your baby, so call your doctor if you can't stop vomiting or can't keep down any food. Pregnancy is one of the few times in a woman's life when weight gain is considered a good thing, but don't overdo it. During the first trimester, you should gain about 3 to 6 pounds (your doctor may recommend that you adjust your weight gain up or down if you started your pregnancy underweight or overweight). Although you're carrying an extra person, don't go by the adage of \"eating for two.\" You only need about an extra 150 calories a day during your first trimester.

This is a severe form of clinical depression related to pregnancy and childbirth. One study of 10,000 moms with newborns found that about 1 in 7 get postpartum depression. It's the type of depression you may get after you have a baby. It can start any time during your baby's first year, but it's most common for you to start to feel its effects during the first 3 weeks after birth. If you have it, you might feel sad, hopeless, and guilty because you may not feel like you want to bond with, or care for, your baby. You can get it even if you didn't have it when your other children were born. This quick change can trigger depression in some women. (If you ever feel moody before you get your period, you know how hormones can affect you.) If you've had depression before, or it runs in your family, you may be more likely to have postpartum depression. If you didn't want to be pregnant, or your partner and family don't help you care for your baby, you're more likely to become depressed as a new mom.

Some women may go through \"the change\" earlier if they've had surgery to remove their uterus or ovaries or are having certain treatments for cancer. You may start to notice changes months or years before you are in menopause. You may have hot flashes and irregular periods. You won't know exactly when your menopause will hit. All you can do is pay attention to how you're feeling and notice changes. This is the classic sign that you are on your way to menopause. Your periods may come more often or less often, be heavier or lighter, or last longer or shorter than before. When you're in perimenopause, it can be hard to predict when, or if, your next period may come. It's also harder to gauge how long your period will last or if your flow will be heavy or light. It's harder to get pregnant during this phase, but it's still possible as long as you have periods. Any bleeding, even just spotting, after menopause isn't normal. You have hot flashes and night sweats. Hot flashes can make you feel warm or hot suddenly for no apparent reason. Night sweats are hot flashes that happen during sleep. Like so many symptoms of menopause, hot flashes and night sweats can vary a lot from woman to woman. For some women, these symptoms go on for years or decades after they've stopped their periods -- into the time called postmenopause. If you have hot flashes but aren't sure it's related to menopause, talk to your doctor. Waking up during the night or having trouble going to sleep can happen for lots of reasons, but if you don't typically have problems sleeping, it may be a sign you're approaching menopause. Sometimes it's caused by other menopausal symptoms like night sweats. If sleep problems hang on for a while, and you can't pinpoint why, it may be time to tell your doctor. Lots of things can affect your mood, and that includes the change in hormone that happens around menopause. If you've had anxiety or depression in the past, your symptoms may worsen during menopause. Whatever the reason, you deserve to feel good. Together, you can decide on a treatment to help you feel better. Both men and women can have some minor memory lapses during middle age: not being able to think of a word or losing the car keys. Forgetfulness can stem from not only menopause but also from stress. Some women say they are less interested in sex or have trouble getting aroused when they are in menopause.

It's also considered moderate if it can't be controlled using a skin medication or if it has a significant impact on your quality of life. If more than 10% of your body is affected, or if large areas on your face, palms or soles of your feet have patches, you have severe psoriasis. It can also be deemed severe if it can't be controlled using a skin medication or it has a severe impact on your quality of life.

Although acne remains largely a curse of adolescence, about 20% of all cases occur in adults. Acne commonly starts during puberty between the ages of 10 and 13 and tends to be worse in people with oily skin. Teenage acne usually lasts for five to 10 years, normally going away during the early 20s. Contrary to popular belief, acne isn't caused by a harmful diet, poor hygiene, or an uncontrolled sex drive. The simple truth is that heredity and hormones are behind most forms of acne. Swearing off chocolate or scrubbing your face 10 times a day won't change your predisposition to this unsightly, sometimes painful, and often embarrassing skin problem. During puberty, both boys and girls produce high levels of androgens, the male sex hormones that include testosterone. Testosterone signals the body to make more sebum, the oil produced in the skin's oil glands. Excess sebum clogs the openings to hair follicles -- especially those on the face, neck, chest, and back. Sometimes, this clogging causes the follicle wall to break under the pressure of this buildup. When this happens, sebum leaks into nearby tissues and forms a pustule or a papule -- this is called inflammatory acne. Depending on the type of pill, oral contraceptives may trigger acne in some women but suppress it in others. However, acne infantum may last longer, be more severe, and cause scarring. Despite the normal increase in androgen levels during puberty, some doctors believe that flare-ups of acne have less to do with androgen levels than with how a person's skin responds to an increase in sebum production or to the bacteria that causes acne. The bacteria Propionibacterium acnes occurs naturally in healthy hair follicles. If too many of them accumulate in plugged follicles, they may secrete enzymes that break down sebum and cause inflammation. Sebum levels that might cause a pimple or two in one person may result in widespread outbreaks -- or even acute cystic acne -- in another person."], [531, "Pantothenate Kinase Associated Neurodege... Understanding ADHD -- the Basics", "ADHD is a chronic condition marked by persistent inattention, hyperactivity, and sometimes impulsivity. Symptoms of ADHD can differ from person to person, but there are three basic types of ADHD. The symptoms of hyperactivity and possibly impulsiveness appear to diminish with age but are seen in the primarily hyperactive/impulsive type. ADHD is more common in boys, whose impulsivity and hyperactivity may appear as disruptive behavior. Inattentiveness is a hallmark of ADHD in girls, but because they aren't often disruptive in the classroom, they may be harder to diagnose. When one person is diagnosed with ADHD, there is a 25%-35% chance that another family member will also have the condition, compared to 4%-6% of the general public. No one knows for sure whether ADHD is more common today, but it is very clear that the number of children getting diagnosed and treated for ADHD has risen over time. Some of this increase in diagnosis and treatment is due to greater awareness of the symptoms and an expansion of what is considered ADHD. Some experts feel that ADHD is over diagnosed, while others feel it is under diagnosed or under treated."], [532, "Pantothenate Kinase Associated Neurodege... Diet and ADHD", "But certain foods may play at least some role in affecting symptoms in a small group of people, research suggests. Here are answers to questions about elimination diets, supplements, and foods that may help symptoms of the disorder. It may include the foods you eat and any nutritional supplements you may take. Ideally, your eating habits would help the brain work better and lessen symptoms, such as restlessness or lack of focus. You may hear about these choices that you could focus on: Overall nutrition: The assumption is that some foods you eat may make your symptoms better or worse. Supplementation diet: With this plan you add vitamins, minerals, or other nutrients. Supporters of these diets think that if you don't get enough of certain nutrients, it may add to your symptoms. Elimination diets: These involve not eating foods or ingredients that you think might be triggering certain behaviors or making your symptoms worse. Many health experts, though, think that what you eat and drink may play a role in helping symptoms. One expert, Richard Sogn, MD, says that whatever is good for the brain is likely to be good for ADHD. Beans, cheese, eggs, meat, and nuts can be good sources of protein. Eat these kinds of foods in the morning and for after-school snacks. It may help improve concentration and possibly make ADHD medications work for longer. Cut down on how many of these you eat: candy, corn syrup, honey, sugar, products made from white flour, white rice, and potatoes without the skins. Load up on vegetables and some fruits, including oranges, tangerines, pears, grapefruit, apples, and kiwi. Walnuts, Brazil nuts, and olive and canola oil are other foods with these in them. The FDA approved an omega compound called Vayarin as part of an ADHD management strategy. Some experts recommend that people with ADHD take a 100% vitamin and mineral supplement each day. Other nutrition experts, though, think that people who eat a normal, balanced diet don't need vitamin or micronutrient supplements. If the symptoms get better or go away, then you keep avoiding that food. Most scientists don't recommend this approach for managing ADHD, though. Still, here are some common areas of concern and what the experts suggest: Food additives In 1975 an allergist first proposed that artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives might lead to hyperactivity in some children. Since then, researchers and child behavior experts have hotly debated this issue. But one study has shown that some food coloring and one preservative did increase hyperactivity in some children. Based on this and other recent studies, the American Academy of Pediatrics now agrees that eliminating preservatives and food colorings from the diet is a reasonable option for children with ADHD. Some experts recommend that people with ADHD avoid these substances: Artificial colors, especially red and yellow Food additives such as aspartame, MSG (monosodium glutamate), and nitrites. Sugar Some children become hyperactive after eating candy or other sugary foods. No evidence suggests that this is a cause of ADHD, though. Caffeine Small amounts of it may help with some ADHD symptoms in children, studies have shown. Most experts recommend that people eat or drink less caffeine or avoid it altogether. It you take medication for ADHD, caffeine can exacerbate some side effects."], [533, "Panmyelophthisis Symptoms", "Symptoms of Parkinson's disease differ from person to person. Symptoms that one person gets in the early stages of the disease, another person may not get until later-or not at all. They develop slowly and often go unnoticed by family, friends, and even the person who has them. The disease causes motor symptoms and non-motor symptoms. Tremor is often the first symptom that people with Parkinson's disease or their family members notice. The tremor also may affect the chin, lips, and tongue. As the disease progresses, the tremor may spread to both sides of the body. Emotional and physical stress tends to make the tremor more noticeable. Sleep, complete relaxation, and intentional movement or action usually reduce or stop the tremor. Although tremor is one of the most common signs of Parkinson's, not everyone with tremor has Parkinson's. Unlike tremor caused by Parkinson's, tremor caused by other conditions gets better when your arm or hand is not moving and gets worse when you try to move it. The most common cause of non-Parkinson's tremor is essential tremor. Besides tremor, the most common symptoms include: Stiff muscles (rigidity) and aching muscles. Rigidity can also affect the muscles of the legs, face, neck, or other parts of the body. It may cause muscles to feel tired and achy. For instance, it may be hard to get out of a chair or turn over in bed. It may get harder to talk and swallow. A person with this disease is likely to take small steps and shuffle with his or her feet close together, bend forward slightly at the waist, and have trouble turning around. FreezingFreezing, a sudden, brief inability to move. A small number of people have symptoms on only one side of the body that never move to the other side. These can be disabling and may include things like constipation, sleep problems, and depression. There are many other conditions with symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease."], [534, "Pantothenate Kinase Associated Neurodege... Parenting a Child With ADHD", "Parents often criticize children with ADHD for their behavior -- but it's more helpful to seek out and praise good behavior instead of punishing or taking away things for bad behavior. Ways to do this include: Providing clear, consistent expectations, directions, and limits. Children with ADHD need to know exactly what others expect from them. That means learning discipline methods that reward appropriate behavior and respond to misbehavior with alternatives such as time out or loss of privileges. Creating a behavior modification plan to change the most problematic behaviors. Behavior charts that track your child's chores or responsibilities and that offer potential rewards for positive behaviors can be helpful tools. Children with ADHD may need help organizing their time and belongings. Your child will function best if he has the same routine every day, from wake-up to bedtime. Your child should have a place for everything and keep everything in its place. Stress the importance of having your child write down assignments and bring home the needed books. You can help your child with ADHD achieve academic success by taking steps to improve the quality of your child's homework. You can do this by making sure your child is: Seated in a quiet area without clutter or distractions Given clear, concise instructions Encouraged to write each assignment in a notebook as it is given by the teacher Responsible for his or her own assignments; you should not do for your child what your child can do for himself. Well-hydrated and fed; a snack break can do wonders for helping to sustain attention. Also, see if your child does better with a short break after school. Driving poses special risks for teens with ADHD. The following behaviors associated with ADHD impose serious driving hazards: Inattention Impulsivity Risk-taking Immature judgment Need for stimulation Discuss driving privileges with your teen in relation to the overall ADHD treatment plan. It is your responsibility to establish rules and expectations for safe driving behaviors. Be sure to include a discussion about the risks of texting and talking on the phone while driving. Not all children with ADHD have trouble getting along with others. It is helpful for you to: Recognize the importance of healthy peer relationships for children Involve your child in activities with his or her peers; choosing an activity your child is particularly good at or enjoys will help them to have the confidence needed to focus on engaging more with peers. Set up social behavior goals with your child and implement a reward program Encourage social interactions if your child is withdrawn or excessively shy Schedule play activities with only one other child at a time Supervise play activities as your child practices social skills."], [535, "Pantothenate Kinase Associated Neurodege... Multimodal Treatment", "ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) is characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and the inability to control impulses. It affects an estimated 5.2 million school-age children in the U.S. Everyone, especially younger children, may have symptoms of ADHD from time to time. A diagnosis of ADHD can be hard to make, and evaluation must be made by a specialist. These include: Amphetamine (Adzenys XR-ODT) Amphetamine/Dextroamphetamine (Adderall, Adderall XR) Dexmethylphenidate (Focalin, Focalin XR) Dextroamphetamine ( Dexedrine or Dextrostat) Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) Methylphenidate (Concerta, Daytrana, Metadate, Methylin, Quillivant XR, Ritalin) Some of these drugs may be available in longer-acting formulations. Non-stimulant medications used to treat ADHD, include: Atomoxetine (Strattera) Clonidine ER (Kapvay) Guanfacine ER (Intuniv) ADHD medications are used to improve children's ability to concentrate and work. Sometimes, a doctor must prescribe different medications or different dosages before finding the best treatment for a child. Side effects of ADHD medicines can include: Anxiety Decreased appetite Fatigue Irritability Sleeping difficulties Skin discoloration (with patches) Upset stomach Most side effects are minor and improve with time. In some cases, doctors may lower a medication dosage to relieve side effects. The FDA recommends that a thorough medical history and exam, including an evaluation of underlying heart or psychiatric problems, be done as part of an ADHD treatment plan. A higher risk of strokes, heart attacks, and sudden death among patients with existing heart conditions has been linked to use of ADHD medications. An increased risk of psychiatric problems has also been linked to ADHD medications. This may involve helping the child learn to organize time and activities. It may also involve helping the child control his or her impulses and responses to emotional stimuli. For parents, this may include learning parenting skills to help the child manage his or her behavior. That would involve skills such as giving positive feedback for desirable behaviors, ignoring undesirable behaviors, and giving time-outs when the child's behavior is out of control. In some cases, the child's entire family may be involved in this part of the treatment. For older children with ADHD, age 6 and older, an approach that includes both behavior therapy and medication is preferred. Children who receive multimodal treatment may need lower doses of medications compared to children only receiving medication."], [536, "Pantothenate Kinase Associated Neurodege... Diagnosis & Treatment", "ADHD is a complex condition and is sometimes difficult to diagnose. To confirm a diagnosis of ADHD or learning differences, a battery of tests may be given to assess a child's neurological and psychological status. The tests include: A medical and social history of both the child and the family. A physical exam and neurological assessment that includes screenings of vision , hearing, and verbal and motor skills. An evaluation of intelligence, aptitude, personality traits, or processing skills. A scan, called the Neuropsychiatric EEG-Based Assessment Aid (NEBA) System, that measures theta and beta brain waves. The most effective treatment for ADHD is thought to be a combination of medication and psychological and behavioral therapies. Close cooperation among therapists, doctors, teachers, and parents is very important, and team meetings help. They include amphetamine salt combo (Adderall, Adderall XR), dexmethylphenidate (Focalin, Focalin XR), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine ), lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse), methylphenidate (Concerta, Daytrana, Metadate, Methylin, Ritalin, Quillichew, Quillivant XR), and and mixed salts of a single-entity amphetamine product (Mydayis). Daytrana a methylphenidate-based that comes in the form of a skin patch that is applied once a day and worn for about 9 hours. A doctor needs to monitor the dosage of the stimulant medication closely, both to determine the most effective level of drug and to watch for any side effects. Generally, most side effects of stimulants are mild and may include decreased appetite, stomach aches, sleep problems, headaches , and an increase in anxiety . For instance, some are linked to a higher risk of heart problems and sudden death in children with preexisting heart disease. They may also worsen psychiatric conditions like depression or anxiety or cause a psychotic reaction in some individuals. Before your kids start taking an ADHD medicine, talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits. Atomoxetine ( Strattera ) and clonidine ( Catapres and Kapvay) are two non-stimulant drugs for ADHD. Another drug similar to clonidine, approved for children aged 6 to 17, is guanfacine (Intuniv), which uses the same active ingredient as guanfacine hydrochloride (Tenex), a blood pressure medicine that has been used as an ADHD treatment. In 2005, the FDA issued a public health advisory about rare reports of suicidal thinking in children and adolescents taking Strattera. In some cases, doctors may try prescribing other antidepressant medications, such as drugs called SSRIs, bupropion (Wellbutrin), venlafaxine (Effexor) or others. Psychotherapy, including cognitive behavioral therapy is a valuable option, particularly if the child has low self-esteem, depression or anxiety. These tips may help your child -- and you: Join a support group. Organizations include Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD). Because a child with ADHD may have difficulty processing directions and other information, he or she is apt to be bombarded with corrections, leaving him with a low opinion of himself. Make instructions simple and specific (\"Brush your teeth. Encourage your child's special strengths, particularly in sports and out-of-school activities. Set and follow routines for meals, bedtime, play, and other activities. Make time for play and exercise -- outside in a natural setting if possible. Simplify your child's room to minimize distractions, such as toys and improve organization."], [537, "Pantothenate Kinase Associated Neurodege... Prevention", "Though there is no way to prevent ADHD , there are ways to help all children feel and do their best at home and at school. Some studies suggest a pregnant woman's exposure to lead, as well as lead exposure in early childhood, may be linked to ADHD. Other studies are exploring the possible connection between premature birth and ADHD. Giving your child a healthy, balanced diet from an early age is good for all children, whether or not they have ADHD. It is an elimination diet that targets artificial colorings, flavorings, and preservatives. Still, many parents who have tried the diet reported an improvement in their child's behavior. There is no scientific proof linking ADHD to sugar. This blood sugar spike may produce an adrenaline rush that could cause a child to become more active, followed by a \"crash\" in activity and mood as the adrenaline levels fall. It's usually best to eliminate one food or category at a time so that you can be certain the effect you are seeing can be attributed to the category you are eliminating. Some experts, though, think that behavioral changes may be due to the way the families interact with each other while they're on an elimination diet. The child's behavior may improve -- not because of the diet, but as a result of getting more attention from the parents. It's important to weigh the risks and benefits of elimination diets, particularly for children who may be experiencing decreased appetite as a side effect of many medications commonly used to treat ADHD. Post a daily schedule where your child can see it, so they know what to expect. This daily schedule should include specific times for such activities as: Waking up Eating meals Playing Doing homework Doing chores Watching TV Taking part in after-school activities Going to bed Once the schedule is set, follow it as closely as possible each day. If there are going to be any disruptions in the schedule, explain them in advance to your child. Though posting a schedule doesn't prevent ADHD, it should help improve your child's ability to stay on task. For older children, with or without ADHD, having a homework routine in place can make the after-school time more effective. Taking small breaks during homework time can also help, especially if your child is hyperactive and has difficulty staying focused. Therapists say this can be done by spending quality time with your child each day -- your child's \"special time.\" The next step in behavioral management is to use positive reinforcement when your child behaves well. Experts encourage parents to notice their child's good behavior at least five times a day and offer simple praise for it. If you think of several appropriate rewards and let your child pick from among them, they may take more ownership in the program. Then make all directions very specific, simple, and concise, and explain them in a calm voice. If you don't always reward good behavior, for example, it sends your child mixed messages. If your child's teacher is using a behavior or reward system at school, try to implement a similar system at home. Many teachers use points, stickers, or color-level systems to reward good behavior. The last step in behavioral management is providing negative consequences for bad behavior. Once again, it is important to explain bad behavior to your child clearly. Then explain the negative consequences for bad behavior. Using negative consequences for unacceptable behavior is controversial, and negative consequences should never be cruel, abusive, or a reflection of your own emotions, no matter how frustrated you may feel. For behavior therapy to work, give children with ADHD frequent reminders of expected behavior and consequences. One way to do this is to write down the rules, consequences, and rewards. Keep changing the reward system so they don't get bored. If you have a preschooler, play games, build with blocks, and do puzzles together. Reading to your child is another good way to teach them how to pay attention. Not everyone agrees, but some experts think that television watching can hinder a child's ability to learn to pay attention. Regardless of whether or not TV causes attention deficiencies, the American Academy of Pediatrics says children younger than 18 months should watch very little TV. The academy also says that between the ages of 2 and 5, they should watch no more than 1 hour a day. Video chatting for toddlers/babies is ok at any age."], [538, "Pantothenate Kinase Associated Neurodege... Common Symptoms", "The symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -- or ADHD -- vary from person to person, but consist of some combination of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Focusing conscious, deliberate attention to organizing and completing routine tasks may be difficult. Often they lose track of things or forget things easily. You may notice restlessness, procrastination, problems remembering obligations, trouble staying seated during meetings or activities, or starting multiple projects at the same time but rarely finishing them. Children with ADHD are unable to sit still and pay attention in class. They may roam around the room, squirm in their seats, wiggle their feet, touch everything or noisily tap a pencil. Older adolescents and adults with ADHD may feel intensely restless. As a result, they may blurt out answers to questions or inappropriate comments, or run into the street without looking. Their impulsivity may make it difficult for them to wait for things they want or to take their turn in games. ADHD often coexists with other conditions, such as learning disabilities, depression, anxiety, conduct disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder. Because the disorder can be difficult to assess, be sure to see a doctor who is experienced with diagnosing and treating ADHD and similar problems."], [539, "Pantothenate Kinase Associated Neurodege...

Instead, diagnosing is a process that takes several steps and involves gathering a lot of information from multiple sources. You, your child, your child's school, and other caregivers should be involved in assessing your child's behavior. A doctor will also ask what symptoms your child has, how long ago those symptoms started, and how the behavior affects your child and the rest of your family. Doctors diagnose ADHD in children after a child has shown six or more specific symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity on a regular basis for more than 6 months in at least two settings. The doctor will consider how a child's behavior compares with that of other children the same age. A doctor will give your child a physical exam, take a medical history, and may even give him a noninvasive brain scan. Your child's primary care doctor can determine whether your child has ADHD using standard guidelines developed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which says the condition may be diagnosed in children ages 4 to 18. That's because many preschool children have some of the symptoms seen in ADHD in various situations. In some cases, behavior that looks like ADHD might be caused instead by: A sudden life change (such as divorce, a death in the family, or moving) Undetected seizures Medical disorders affecting brain function Anxiety Depression Bipolar disorder Doctors may classify symptoms as the following types of ADHD: Combined type (inattentive/hyperactive/impulsive). Children with this type of ADHD show all three symptoms. Studies show that long-term treatment with a combination of medications and behavioral therapy is much better than just medication treatment, or no specific treatments in managing hyperactivity, impulsivity, inattention, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. A class of drugs called psychostimulants (or sometimes just stimulants) is a highly effective treatment for childhood ADHD. Another treatment used to treat ADHD in kids is nonstimulant medication. ADHD medicines are available in short-acting (immediate-release), intermediate-acting, and long-acting forms. It may take some time for a doctor to find the best medication, dosage, and schedule for someone with ADHD. Behavioral treatment for children with ADHD includes creating more structure, encouraging routines, and clearly stating expectations of the child. Other forms of ADHD treatment that may benefit your child include: Social skills training. This can help a child with ADHD learn behaviors that will help them develop and maintain social relationships. For example, a child may have undesirable side effects to a medication, making a particular treatment unacceptable. If a child with ADHD also has anxiety or depression, a treatment combining medication and behavioral therapy might be best. Coaching is a relatively new field in the treatment of ADHD in children.

Non-Drug Treatments", "Medications are the top treatment for ADHD, and they're effective for 80% of kids with the disorder. But many parents worry about side effects and want to exhaust every other option before they put their child on medicine. \"My son was just 5 years old when he was diagnosed with ADHD, and I thought that was too young for medication,\" she says. They almost always recommend that, before age 6, you start with behavior therapy. \"Parents often ask if they can try other treatments first before they turn to medication, and there are several methods that are effective,\" says Richard Gallagher, PhD, of the Institute for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity and Behavior Disorders at the NYU Child Study Center. He encourages parents to try other things while they look into the risks and benefits of medications. Gallagher says that behavior changes alone are most effective with kids who are only inattentive and unfocused, rather than those who are also impulsive and hyperactive. The most successful treatment for ADHD combines both meds and behavior management. Parents and classroom teachers play a starring role in helping a child learn to recognize and adjust his behavior, Gallagher says. For parents, this means creating small, manageable goals for their child, such as sitting for 10 minutes at the dinner table, and then giving rewards for achieving them. It's also helpful for the teacher to send home a daily \"report card,\" letting the parents know whether the child met his behavior goals at school that day. Sonia's son is now 10 years old, and \"Ever since he was in kindergarten, I've worked with his teachers to help him modify his own behavior,\" she says. \"He gets graded every 20 minutes on three goals: staying seated, staying on task, and being respectful of others.\" A coach or tutor can work with older children to come up with a system for keeping track of their books, papers, and assignments, says Edward Hallowell, MD, the author of Delivered from Distraction. \"This is more helpful than Mom or Dad trying to help organize, because with a parent, it can come across as nagging,\" he says. \"A lot of kids with ADHD also have sleep disorders, and each condition makes the other one worse,\" says Mark Stein, PhD, an ADHD specialist at the Seattle Children's Hospital. One of the most common sleep issues for kids with ADHD is that they can't settle down and fall asleep; then their exhaustion the next day makes their symptoms worse. \"We have bedtime broken down into 10 specific tasks, like taking a bath, putting on pajamas, reading for a half-hour,\" Sonia says. Take computers, TVs, phones, and video games out of the bedroom so your child isn't distracted or tempted. Make sure your child has plenty of opportunities to run and play (at appropriate times). Some recent studies found that after about 30 minutes of exercise, kids with ADHD can focus and organize their thoughts better. \"He enjoys the feel of the water and always feels calmer when he gets out of the pool.\" If your child wants to play organized sports that require focus and concentration, like baseball or tennis, there's more to the equation. \"Before they started medication, many of my patients were stuck playing the outfield, where they would just wander around chasing daisies,\" Stein says. One small study found that when both children and their parents completed an 8-week mindfulness-training program, the kids had fewer symptoms. This is promising news, but Gallagher points out there isn't yet enough solid evidence to fully recommend the strategy. There's very little hard research specifically connecting music with ADHD symptoms, but scientists do know that when children play an instrument -- taking piano lessons at home, say, or playing cello with a school orchestra -- they do much better on tests of executive function than children who don't study music. Over the years, several \"ADHD diets\" have been proposed and then dismissed by science. A study found that kids with ADHD have lower levels of omega-3s in their blood, which suggests bumping up the amount in their diet might reduce ADHD symptoms.

All teens can be emotional, but one with ADHD may have more trouble keeping his emotions in check. Because of the tendency to be impulsive, a teen with ADHD might do risky things, including use alcohol and drugs, lie, steal, and have unprotected sex. Safety in the car may also be a problem. \"This is one of the worst disorders you can have while operating a motor vehicle,\" Barkley says.

It is associated with at least three of the following symptoms: Restlessness Fatigue Difficulty concentrating Irritability or explosive anger Muscle tension Sleep disturbances Personality changes, such as becoming less social Phobic disorders are intense, persistent, and recurrent fear of certain objects (such as snakes, spiders, blood) or situations (such as heights, speaking in front of a group, public places). Post-traumatic stress disorder -- or PTSD -- was considered to be a type of anxiety disorder in earlier versions of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Common behaviors include the following: Avoiding activities, places, or people associated with the triggering event Difficulty concentrating Difficulty sleeping Being hypervigilant (you closely watch your surroundings) Feeling a general sense of doom and gloom with diminished emotions (such as loving feelings or aspirations for the future) Symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, fainting, and weakness should not be automatically attributed to anxiety and require evaluation by a doctor."], [577, "Pancreatic Cancer Pancreatic Cancer", "Pancreatic cancer is classified according to which part of the pancreas is affected: the part that makes digestive substances (exocrine) or the part that makes insulin and other hormones (endocrine). Exocrine Pancreatic Cancer Although there are several different types of exocrine pancreatic cancer, 95% of cases are due to pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Other less common exocrine pancreatic cancers include: Adenosquamous carcinoma Squamous cell carcinoma Giant cell carcinoma Acinar cell carcinoma Small cell carcinoma The exocrine pancreas makes up 95% of the pancreas, so it's not surprising that most pancreatic cancers arise here. Endocrine Pancreatic Cancer Other cells of the pancreas make hormones that are released directly into the bloodstream (endocrine system). Cancerous tumors arising from these cells are called pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors or islet cell tumors. Endocrine pancreatic cancers are uncommon, and are named according to the type of hormone produced: Insulinomas (from an insulin-producing cell) Glucagonomas (from a glucagon-producing cell) Somatostatinomas (from a somatostatin-making cell) Gastrinomas (from a gastrin-producing cell) VIPomas (from vasoactive intestinal peptide-making cell) Some pancreatic islet cell tumors do not secrete hormones and are known as non-secreting islet tumors of the pancreas. Pancreatic cancer occurs when cells in the pancreas grow, divide, and spread uncontrollably, forming a malignant tumor. In addition to a history and physical exam, imaging tests will be performed to help make the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. These tests include: Ultrasound CT scanning MRI Endoscopic ultrasonography Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) A definitive diagnosis of pancreatic cancer only comes from removal of tissue (biopsy) for examination in a lab. Chemotherapy and radiation are often given together, prior to, after, or even without surgery, to slow pancreatic cancer's growth. Most cases of pancreatic cancer have already spread at the time of diagnosis, making a full cure unlikely. Treatments can allow people to live longer with pancreatic cancer and improve their quality of life. Clinical trials are ongoing to discover more effective ways of treating pancreatic cancer."], [578, "Palliative Care For Caregivers", "Deciding to become their caregiver, to help them manage their pain and suffering -- or manage it for them -- is a difficult choice. Eunice Czarnecki, 73, had been helping her brother manage his heart disease and diabetes for years. But when he took a sudden turn for the worse, his doctor at Milwaukee's VA Medical Center told him his body simply couldn't fight any more. \"But, even though he was having trouble breathing and was in a lot of pain, he wanted to die at home.\" \"I knew I could take care of him as long as I had help with his pain,\" she says. A major part of their discussion was about the end-of-life care her husband would need and want. We talked about quality of life and how to keep things as normal as possible. And we talked about how to make sure he won't suffer and the options we have to prevent that from happening,\" Lowe tells WebMD. Palliative care is person-centered care with a goal of maximizing a patient's quality of life. To achieve this, the palliative care team attends to physical, emotional, social, and spiritual quality of life -- for the caregiver as well as for the patient. \"It's very supportive and very holistic care,\" Ben Marcantonio, MFT, of the Institute for Palliative Medicine at San Diego Hospice, tells WebMD. The growing use of hospice -- with its emphasis on pain control and quality of life -- has made people more aware of the benefits of palliative care for all patients, not just those who are dying. And it's demonstrated the important role family caregivers play on the palliative care team, says Christine Hudak, MD, associate director of Summa Palliative Care and Hospice Services in Akron, Ohio. \"They don't just know the person's likes and dislikes, they are also more likely to know their preferences for pain treatments and medical care, too,\" Hudak tells WebMD. To find a palliative care team, Hudak suggests talking to the doctor most involved in your loved one's care or a hospital social worker. Usually they will refer you to a hospital program because almost 60% of large hospitals -- those with 50 or more beds -- have palliative care programs. If the person you are caring for is a veteran, contact the Veterans Administration. Care consultants at local organizations, such as the Alzheimer's Association, may also be able to provide information on palliative care programs. Good palliative care programs have two things in common, Hudak says. They use inter-disciplinary teams and each team works with the patient and family to create a personalized care plan. Typically, teams include: a physician, who coordinates pain and symptom management and coordinates comfort care. a pharmacist, who works with the physician to prescribe medications and monitor their effectiveness. a specially trained nurse, who provides direct care to the patient and information, education, and medical support to the family. a social worker/case manager, who helps navigate the health care bureaucracy, locate community resources, and provide counseling and emotional support to patient and family. a chaplain, who addresses the patient's and caregiver's spiritual needs. It helps people look at options and it provides step-by-step help for caregivers in making the decisions they need to make for the best quality of life for their family member,\" Helene Morgan, MSW, a member of the pediatric palliative care team at Children's Hospital in Los Angeles, tells WebMD. Whether you are a spouse, adult child, or close friend, choosing to help provide palliative care -- to become a member of the palliative care team -- means you are making \"a role-changing decision,\" Marcantonio says. Because of the added responsibilities and commitment that come with being a caregiver, you will constantly ask yourself: Is palliative care the right thing for my loved one and for me? George Roby is caring for his wife in their Chagrin Falls, Ohio, home. If you feel you are on call 24/7, make sure to maintain a support network and take respite breaks. \"I'm at home a lot with my husband, so I found an online support group, MyParkinsons.org,\" Lowe says. \"I get advice, I vent, and I get an amazing amount of info. It's also important to take a break, says Marita Schifalacqua, who took care of her mother until she died of Alzheimer's in 2010. \"It allowed us to get out of the house for three hours a day. The palliative care team can support caregivers in: Handling added responsibilities and unforeseen challenges. According to the National Alliance for Caregiving, the best sources of information are your palliative care team; the Internet; support groups, including online support groups; disease-specific organizations; government agencies and programs (the VA, Medicare, Medicaid); social service organizations; and books and magazines. If you are employed -- and a recent MetLife report on caregivers in the workforce says 62% of caregivers under age 60 are -- there may be problems balancing work and caregiving. When problems surface, contact your company's HR director or Employee Assistance Program. And take advantage of the Family Medical Leave Act: It's there to enable you to care for a loved one. But she adds, \"If you can't get everyone on the same page, accept that fact and move on.\" To obtain help in managing finances and insurance, see the palliative care team's social worker. Potential sources of aid include Medicare, Medicaid, the VA, the local Area Agency on Aging, state disability programs, local social service agencies, and local disease-specific organizations and charities. This more \"high touch\" care often provides opportunities to express love and affection and to create special moments. \"When I went to the doctor he told me that I had a broken heart and that nothing would cure it except crying and time,\" she says."], [579, "Pain Management What Causes Chronic Pain?", "Often conditions that accompany normal aging may affect bones and joints in ways that cause chronic pain. Back pain, for example, may be caused by a single factor, or any combination of these factors: Years of poor posture Improper lifting and carrying of heavy objects Being overweight, which puts excess strain on the back and knees A congenital condition such as curvature of the spine Traumatic injury Wearing high heels Sleeping on a poor mattress No obvious physical cause Ordinary aging of the spine (degenerative changes) Disease can also be the underlying cause of chronic pain. Rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia are well-known culprits, but persistent pain may also be due to such ailments as cancer, multiple sclerosis, stomach ulcers, AIDS, and gallbladder disease. In many cases, however, the source of chronic pain can be a very complex and even mysterious issue to untangle. Although it may begin with an injury or illness, ongoing pain can develop a psychological dimension after the physical problem has healed."], [580, "Palliative Care For Children", "It felt like a sign that we were going to be able to take him home,\" Zrenda tells WebMD. It's important to try to put a little bit of normalcy into the family's life,\" says Zrenda, who is now coordinator of the hospital's family connections program. Bringing normalcy to families' lives is a goal of pediatric palliative care, also known as pediatric advanced care (PAC). \"We're supporting the whole family, beginning at [the child's] diagnosis and following them through,\" Yale PAC team coordinator Cindy Jayanetti, NP, tells WebMD. The PAC team guides children and their families through the hospital experience. The palliative care team doesn't replace the active treatment team. The pain may come from symptoms of the child's condition, of course, but also from side effects caused by curative treatments, anxiety over diagnosis, or dread of an unsure future. \"Dramatic life changes are going to happen both for the child and the family, so we're brought in. When the child becomes stable or there don't seem to be those kinds of needs anymore, we can sign off,\" says Helene Morgan, LCSW, social worker on the comfort and palliative care team at Los Angeles Children's Hospital. For parents who fear that the PAC team is only called in when there are no other options, Arden O'Donnell, LCSW, tells WebMD, \"The team's job and the doctor's job is to save the patient. O'Donnell, who is a palliative care social worker at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center, says when parents are being asked to make hard decisions, PAC should be there. When curative treatment fails, the PAC team continues to work with the family to help identify the child's and the parents' wishes and goals of care. So it became the focus of clinical decision making,\" says Megan McCabe, MD, director of the pediatric critical care fellowship program at Yale School of Medicine. If a child dies, the palliative care team continues to support the family through the bereavement process. \"It's so important to have someone who already knows you, to keep the relationships you have, not to bring in somebody new at the time of death,\" Morgan tells WebMD. For these reasons, it is ideal for palliative care teams to come in as soon as a child is diagnosed with a chronic or life-limiting condition. PAC has signed off on many people because they got better,\" says O'Donnell. A PAC team typically is composed of a doctor, a nurse coordinator, and one or more mental health specialists. The latter may be a social worker, psychologist, psychiatrist, child life specialist, or any combination thereof. The more complicated a patient's condition, the greater the number of specialists who may be involved and the greater the number of decisions to be made. The palliative care team can serve as an objective third-party advocate for the patient and family and as a moderator of intense communications with and between the child's doctors. Among the team's first objectives is to learn the goals, wishes, and values of the child and family. Later, if decision making becomes more difficult or heightened emotions cause parents to lose focus, the team can help keep treatment plans on track with the family's original wishes and goals. With pediatric patients, there may be parents, step-parents, and grandparents involved in decision making. \"The majority of our job is being mediator among family members' multiple, conflicting perspectives,\" says Terri Major-Kincade, MD, who is a neonatologist with a specialty in palliative care. The team also helps parents discuss difficult matters with children, whether it is breaking the news of a diagnosis, explaining a condition, or, if the time comes, explaining the possibility of death to the patient and the siblings. Social workers and child life specialists may also give presentations at patients' and siblings' schools, or work with school psychologists, so classmates and friends can understand. Parents are always given the option of explaining their child's condition themselves, but they usually choose to have a specialist in the room who can take over if the conversation becomes too difficult, says Kendra Frederick, who is the certified child life specialist in the pediatric oncology unit at Yale-New Haven Children's Hospital. There are precise ways to explain illness and death to children depending on their age. Social workers can help role play difficult conversations with parents before they occur or show them means of breaking the ice. No matter how hard parents try to protect them from the truth, they know,\" says McCabe. Children often won't ask questions if they sense their parents don't want to talk about it. The pediatric palliative care team works across disciplines to support the whole family and the whole person. It may be a chaplain who rocks a baby in neonatal ICU rather than a nurse. As McCabe tells WebMD, having a seriously ill child \"is a marathon,\" and families need to maintain some elements of normalcy in their lives in order to pace themselves and to cope with long hospital stays. McCabe gives parents a couple of days to get used to being at the hospital before she reminds them that they need to have regular meals, go home for showers and clean clothes, and get outside for a walk or a cup of coffee from time to time. \"It's very easy to lose sight of that when you're in an intense medical environment, but it's so important,\" Zrenda says. She should know: Zrenda's son was 4 months old before she was alone with him for the first time. PAC teams help families have parent-child moments in the hospital by arranging alone time, walks outside, or family portraits with photographers. \"If your child never leaves the hospital, we need to make those things happen for families, to give them some of those memories. Before a sibling enters a hospital room for the first time, Frederick might take a photograph of the room and explain to the sibling everything he or she will see in the room. \"I talk to them about the pumps they might see, the tubes, what bags of fluid and medication are hanging, so they're not overwhelmed when they come in,\" she says. Depending on age, they can feel grief or guilt over the sibling's condition or anger over the attention the sibling is getting. PAC teams help primary care teams manage the symptoms of illness and the side effects of treatments, such as pain, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and anxiety. Experts agree it is ideal to integrate pediatric palliative care with curative treatment at the first diagnosis of a chronic or life-limiting condition. If that does not happen, O'Donnell says there are other points when PAC should be brought in: If first treatment is unsuccessful If symptoms worsen, or if previous symptoms recur If parents are being asked to make increasingly difficult choices If parents feel they need more support Doctors may suggest a consultation with the PAC team, and parents may also request it. Pediatric palliative care is a relatively new medical specialty available in all major children's hospitals, academic hospitals, and in many mid-sized children's hospitals. If a hospital does not have a palliative care program: Primary caregivers will perform some palliative tasks. You could ask your primary caregivers if it is possible to be referred to an outside facility for palliative care services. \"Parents need to know they can ask for palliative care and it does not mean giving up on treatments,\" McCabe says."], [581, "Palliative Care For Adults", "It is true that in the course of many illnesses, cure ceases to be an option. When you receive the information that your illness is serious, a palliative care team can help you handle the news and cope with the many questions and challenges you'll face. The palliative care team works alongside the doctors working to extend your life and, if possible, to cure your illness. By relieving your symptoms, the palliative care team may actually help you improve. \"Our role is to help people live with a serious illness as long as possible, as well as possible,\" says Sean Morrison, MD, director of the National Palliative Care Research Center at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. \"You can be the most intelligent, organized person in the world, but hearing distressing news about your condition makes it hard to keep things straight,\" says Farrah Daly, MD, associate medical director for Capital Caring, which serves more than 1,000 clients in the Washington, D.C. area. That makes it hard to ask the right questions -- and easy to misunderstand the answers. Daly's advice: Bring someone with you to significant medical appointments. Let the other person do whatever it is you need: ask additional questions, write down information, or just be a fly on the wall and listen. \"They should support you in whatever way you need to be supported.\" \"A lot of people come out of discussions like this with misconceptions, because they didn't want to seem like they didn't understand, so they didn't press their doctor for more information.\" \"Often, people interpret the news as worse than it actually is. \" \"When doctors start focusing on managing symptoms rather than on a cure, people's lives often improve,\" she says. \"And the time frame that you have left can vary widely. \"A study done at Massachusetts General Hospital with lung cancer patients showed that those who were randomized to early palliative care plus the usual oncology care lived 2.7 months longer than those who got usual oncology care alone,\" Smith tells WebMD. \"The palliative care group also had better symptom management and less depression, and the caregivers fared better afterward, maybe because they were prepared, or their loved one died at home rather than in the ICU, intubated.\" Morrison advises that you ask your doctor the following questions: What can I expect in terms of a prognosis? Once you've learned about your diagnosis , you will have to share the news with others. \"I encourage people not to go it alone,\" Daly says. But even for those who are very private, I encourage them to be sure that the people they most rely on are included in the circle of those who know what's going on and what you're feeling.\" No matter who you tell, be sure to also tell them what you need. \"If you don't direct them in how you want them to help you, they'll help in whatever way they can figure out, and that might not be what you need,\" Daly says. \"Maybe you need for them to come to your house every day and check on you. There are many approaches for updating friends and family about your condition. You can: Designate one friend or family member to pass the news along Send out blanket e-mail updates Create a Web site or blog, or join an existing one like caringbridge.org Post updates on Facebook \"Some people want to tell their story over and over again to each person -- it helps them process their feelings,\" says Daly. \"Others don't want to relive the experience and would rather someone explained things for them. Ask your doctor: What symptoms should I expect, and what are you going to do to treat them? \"There's nothing worse than being in serious pain or having shortness of breath and not being able to do anything except call 911,\" says Morrison. That includes family and friends, of course, but remember that they are anxious about your illness as well. \"It's important to have an impartial, less emotional person to talk to,\" says Daly. \"A support group for people with your illness, or a social worker at your hospital or medical center, can help you talk about your fears without feeling like you're overwhelming your loved ones.\" You can also take your mind off your anxiety by finding time to do the things you love, things that you might not have been able to do when focused intently on a cure. \"One of the burdens of curative treatment is it often takes a lot of time,\" says Daly. \"You go to the doctor's office, come home and rest, go to the infusion center, come home and rest, go to a specialist, come home and rest. The first thing you need to know about pain is that it can be treated. \"There shouldn't be the expectation that you have to live with it,\" says Morrison. \"In fact, there's data showing that untreated pain will lessen your ability to function and may even shorten your life, so it's important to treat it early.\" \"Pain should not be used as a marker for whether or not a treatment is working,\" says Morrison. You just need more specialized care,\" Morrison says. \"Constipation, nausea, and cognitive changes can be side effects of pain medication,\" says Morrison. There's no reason to minimize it or to try to appear stronger about it,\" says Daly. \"Describe what it feels like, where it's located, what makes it worse, and what makes it better. Be prepared to tell your physician anything you've already tried for the symptom, in as much detail as you can.\" Is it helping you reach your goals, like working in the garden or going out with friends? One of the most important members of any palliative care team is a chaplain. Whether you're Christian or Jewish, Hindu or Buddhist, atheist or agnostic or just not sure what you believe, almost everyone has some sort of spiritual concerns in the face of a life-threatening illness. \"You're trying to make sense of what is happening to you,\" says Morrison. \"We may tell our kids that life isn't fair, but we still somehow feel that it should be, and illness like this always feels so unfair. And you may be thinking about questions like whether or not you have regrets, and how you amend those regrets, no matter whether or not you have faith in an organized religion. Chaplains really are trained to help with spiritual crises for those who do and do not have a faith identity.\" But as you've learned, many patients live for years, very well, with a \"terminal\" diagnosis. \"Think critically about what's most important to you,\" Daly advises. \"Those are the keys to improving your quality of life,\" she says. \"Sometimes I meet a patient for the first time and they tell me that their pain or nausea is 'not too bad.' When you're treating for a cure, treatments can be aggressive and often come with extremely difficult side effects. But in palliative care, the goal is to make you as comfortable and happy as you can possibly be. Treatments are available that can alleviate and minimize nausea or pain -- if not take them away entirely -- and make it possible for you to do many things you may have long since given up. \"Some of my patients just want to be able to go outside and enjoy their garden,\" Daly says. \"Others just want to go and enjoy coffee with their girlfriends without being nauseated. People do have to give up a lot of things when they're ill, but if you fight for symptom control, a lot of those things you enjoy are attainable again.\" \"You can talk about your death without saying that you're ready for it yet,\" Daly says. Honestly, it's something you should do even when you're young and healthy, but no one does. Always be talking with the people you trust most about what you would want done, and who you would want to make the decisions when you can't make them for yourself.\" Things to think about include: Where would you like to be at the end? \"Planning for this does not mean you're OKy with it happening,\" Daly says. \"But when you plan in advance for the end, it's a lot more likely to be a peaceful experience for you and your family, with less anxiety and tension.\" \"My goal is that the people who get referred to me live for a very long time,\" Morrison says. \"And we help them manage all of the complications, all of the questions, and all of the resources they need to deal with both the disease and its treatments."], [582, "Palliative Care Meet the Team", "After you've asked your primary care doctor for a referral, you'll meet with your palliative care team to discuss your goals and desires during your illness.

The goals are: Relieve pain and other symptoms Address your emotional and spiritual concerns, and those of your caregivers Coordinate your care Improve your quality of life during your illness For example, a palliative care doctor may prescribe medications and other therapies to treat pain, constipation, shortness of breath, and other symptoms. A chaplain may offer spiritual support and help you to explore your beliefs and values. The palliative care team can also help your family by offering medical information, emotional support, and home care assistance. In general, the interdisciplinary palliative care team includes a doctor, a nurse, and a social worker. But other experts often fill out the team, according to a patient's needs. Often, large hospitals have more extensive palliative care services, but smaller hospitals, nursing homes, and hospices also offer palliative care. Your palliative care team can provide the following services: Expert treatment of pain and other symptoms Open discussion about treatment choices for your illness (including difficult and complex choices) and management of your symptoms Coordination of your care with all of your health care providers Help with navigating the health care system Help with making a smooth transition from the hospital to home care or a nursing home Emotional, spiritual, and practical support for you and your family Here are questions to ask your palliative care team, according to the Center to Advance Palliative Care: What can I expect from palliative care? Where will I receive my care (for example, in the hospital, home, nursing home, or hospice?) What decisions will my family or I need to make?

Palliative care can be performed along with the care you receive from your primary doctors. With palliative care, there is a focus on relieving pain and other troubling symptoms and meeting your emotional, spiritual, and practical needs. In short, this new medical specialty aims to improve your quality of life -- however you define that for yourself. Your palliative care providers will work with you to identify and carry out your goals: symptom relief, counseling, spiritual comfort, or whatever enhances your quality of life. Palliative care can also help you to understand all of your treatment options. In a 2011 survey of palliative care patients, they mentioned these particular needs: \"being recognized as a person,\" \"having a choice and being in control,\" \"being connected to family and the world outside,\" \"being spiritually connected,\" and \"physical comfort.\" Be assured that you may receive palliative care at the same time that you pursue a cure for your illness. Palliative care may also be a good option if you have a serious disease that has prompted multiple hospitalizations or emergency room visits during the previous year. However, if you decide to stop pursuing a cure and your doctor believes that you're within the last few months of life, you can move to hospice. If your family members also need help, palliative care can provide them emotional and spiritual support, educate them about your situation, and support them as caregivers. As the World Health Organization states, \"All people have a right to receive high-quality care during serious illness and to a dignified death, free of overwhelming pain and in line with their spiritual and religious beliefs.\" For example, chemotherapy drugs may cause nausea and vomiting. By providing relief for various symptoms, palliative care can help you not only carry on with your daily life, but also improve your ability to undergo or complete your medical treatments. Here are some symptoms that palliative care may address: Pain Constipation Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Bowel or bladder problems Loss of appetite, weight loss, or wasting Shortness of breath or labored breathing Coughing Depression Delirium or mental confusion Weakness Difficulty sleeping You may start palliative care at any stage of your illness, even as soon as you receive a diagnosis and begin treatment. Anxiety, depression, fatigue, and pain can set in at the beginning of treatment. Palliative care teams understand the stresses that you and your family face and can help you to cope. In most cases, patients receive palliative care in a hospital setting, but services can also be delivered in a patient's home, a hospice, or a long-term care facility."], [585, "Palliative Care What It Is", "Surgeons removed part of her lung, and soon she'll begin chemotherapy. But the 56-year-old New York City resident also benefits from a new type of medical specialty called palliative care. For example, Huggins had a large, painful surgical incision in her torso. In the days before surgery, she had prepared spiritually by talking to a rabbi -- a member of her palliative care team. Then, right before doctors took her to the operating room, that same rabbi appeared at her bedside. A social worker -- also on the palliative care team -- now is helping her with practical matters: obtaining a wig before she loses her hair and arranging transportation for chemotherapy sessions. Say \"palliative care\" and most people imagine cancer patients being made comfortable in an end-of-life hospice setting. But palliative care is actually a new medical specialty that has recently emerged -- and no, it's not the same as hospice. \"It's the whole spectrum, really,\" says Joseph Chan, MD, a palliative care physician in Fort Smith, Ark. \"The vast majority of America's medical schools have palliative care programs and are teaching medical students and residents about palliative care. There was literally no education occurring on the topic,\" says Diane Meier, MD, director of the Center to Advance Palliative Care at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. Currently, there are more than 1,400 hospital palliative care programs in the U.S., according to Meier. About 80% of large U.S. hospitals with more than 300 beds have a palliative care program, she says. Typically, a palliative care team includes a physician, nurse, and social worker, Meier says. But it often involves a chaplain, psychologist or psychiatrist, physical or occupational therapist, dietitian, and others, depending on the patient's needs. Patients like Huggins can begin palliative care as soon as they're diagnosed with a serious illness, at the same time they continue to pursue a cure. Palliative care doesn't signal that a person has given up hope for a recovery. Others with chronic diseases, such as COPD, may move in and out of palliative care as the need arises. If cure of a life-threatening disease proves elusive, palliative care can improve the quality of patients' lives. And when death draws near, palliative care can segue into hospice care. \"Palliative care is genuinely patient-centered, meaning: We ask the patient what's important to them and what their major priorities are. Based on what the patients or the family tell us, we then develop a care plan and a strategy that meets the patient's goals and values.\" \"Maybe one in 10 to one in 20 patients don't care if they're on a ventilator and on dialysis for the rest of their life. But some patients, such as Merijane Block, care more about the quality of each day. Block's palliative care doctor prescribes a medicated patch for chronic spinal pain that would be debilitating otherwise. \"I have pain all the time, but I'm not living in this state of agonizing pain because my pain is actually well managed,\" she says. Although pain management is a major part of palliative care, patients can also seek help with other symptoms such as nausea, loss of appetite, fatigue, constipation, shortness of breath, and trouble sleeping. Beverly, a 55-year-old San Francisco Bay Area woman who requested that her last name be withheld, was diagnosed with bladder cancer at age 37 and has had multiple recurrences. For patients, this means attending to the challenges that illness poses in every aspect of life. It also means that palliative care extends to family members and caregivers. Support services may include: educating family members about the patient's illness, treatment, and medications respite care for caregivers home help with transportation, meals, and shopping. Meier recalls one patient, a 24-year-old woman who developed acute leukemia. She had intense bone pain, severe shortness of breath, panic attacks, anxiety, and a large, devastated family with one sibling who was a substance abuser. \"You get this sense of how complex and intense the palliative care needs were for this young woman,\" Meier says. \"Frankly, I don't think she would have gotten through her treatment at all had she not had expert treatment of her pain, her shortness of breath, her anxiety, and a tremendous amount of counseling and support for her family.\" With all of its emphasis on the whole person -- even one's family and relationships -- does palliative care truly improve quality of life? In a study published in August 2010 in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital found that advanced lung cancer patients who received early palliative care actually had lower rates of depression and better quality of life than patients who received standard treatment only. The study of 151 patients, who were randomly assigned to get standard lung cancer care alone or to get standard care and palliative care at the same time, also yielded a surprise: The palliative care patients tended to live about 2.7 months longer. This may have been due to more effective treatment of depression, better management of symptoms, or less need for hospitalization. For a patient with advanced lung cancer, that extra time is significant. \"If we had a new chemotherapy agent that added three months to the life of lung cancer patients, everyone would be running to invest,\" Meier says."], [586, "Swiss Cheese Cartilage Syndrome", "Kniest dysplasia is one of several forms of dwarfism that is caused by a change (mutation) in a gene known as COL2A1.

This disease occurs due to obstruction of hair follicles and secondary infection and sometimes inflammation of certain sweat glands (apocrine glands). It is a progressive disease where single boil-like, pus-filled abscesses become hard lumps, then painful, deep-seated, often inflamed clusters of lesions with chronic seepage. Formation of chronic epithelialized, sometimes interconnected, sinus tracts occur in severe disease. This often leads to the entrapment of perspiration and bacteria in the surrounding tissue, which causes the inflammation and infection. HS can be extremely painful and debilitating but is rarely life threatening; only occurring when the bacteria infection leads to an overwhelming systemic infection in an individual with a weakened immune system.

In the second form, BRAO and hearing loss are the main problems, and there is little or no brain disease. In the third form, encephalopathy is the main problem in the beginning, but recurrent episodes of BRAO and hearing loss become the main problem after the encephalopathy goes away. The encephalopathic form of Susac's syndrome often resolves spontaneously (often going away within 1 years), even without treatment (self-limited); the other forms tend to follow a more prolonged, more chronic course (3-10 years, or more). In Susac's syndrome, the person's own immune system is mistakenly attacking the endothelial lining of the smallest blood vessels (the capillaries, venules and arterioles) in the brain, retina, and inner ear. When the endothelial cells become injured, they tend to swell, and this endothelial cell swelling plays a key role in the partial or complete occlusion (blockage) of the tiny vessels in the brain, retina and inner ear. This blockage results in decreased blood flow through the vessels and, therefore, decreased delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the brain, retina, and inner ear---causing these three organs to suffer."], [591, "Surgery: What to Expect", "Knowing what to expect before, during, and after surgery can help ease your fears.

Although SIDS is rare, it is one of the most common causes of death in babies between 1 and 12 months of age. It also is seen more often in babies whose mothers didn't get medical care during the pregnancy and in babies whose mothers smoke. SIDS may also be more likely in babies who were part of a multiple pregnancy (for example, twins or triplets) or whose mothers are younger than 20. Researchers are studying the possibility that SIDS may be caused by problems with how well the brain controls breathing, heart rate and rhythm, and temperature during the first few months of life. They show no signs of struggle and are often found in the same position as when they were placed in the bed. To find out why a baby died, medical experts review the baby's and parents' medical histories, study the area where the baby died, and do an autopsy. Doing certain things may help protect a baby from SIDS and/or other deaths related to sleep:1 The most important thing you can do is to always place your baby to sleep on his or her back rather than on the stomach or side. For the first 6 months, have your baby sleep in a crib, cradle, or bassinet in the same room where you sleep. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that you don't ever sleep with your baby in the same bed, especially if you smoke or have used alcohol, illegal drugs, or medicine that makes you sleep very soundly (sedatives). The safest place for a baby is in a crib, cradle, or bassinet that meets safety standards. Keep soft items and loose bedding out of the crib. Items such as blankets, stuffed animals, toys, and pillows could suffocate or trap your baby. Dress your baby in sleepers instead of using blankets. Make sure that your baby's crib has a firm mattress (with a fitted sheet). Don't use bumper pads or other products that attach to crib slats or sides. Don't let your baby sleep in a stroller, swing, car seat or baby chair for any length of time. Keep the room at a comfortable temperature so that your baby can sleep in lightweight clothes without a blanket. Make sure that your baby doesn't get too warm. Your baby is likely too warm if he or she sweats or tosses and turns a lot. If you breastfeed, wait until your baby is about a month old before you start giving him or her a pacifier. Touch is important, so try to get some skin-to-skin time with your baby. There is no sure way to prevent SIDS, and no exam or test can predict whether a baby is likely to die of SIDS. Don't rely on breathing (apnea) monitors, special mattresses, or other devices marketed as a way to reduce your baby's risk of SIDS. The American Academy of Pediatrics does not advise their use. Be as safe as you can, but don't let fear keep you from enjoying your baby. Don't assume that they know what to do to help keep your infant safe during sleep. Each member of your family may respond to the loss of the baby in a different way. These different ways of coping with the baby's death can strain a marriage and a family. Ask your doctor if one for parents who have lost babies to SIDS is available in your area. Many families benefit from group counseling to help them deal with the tensions that arise after the loss of a baby.

Your doctor will take a sample of the tumor during a process called a biopsy and send it to a lab. That means it can't tell if your children or other members of your family have the mutation. Your doctor will also run tests to see how far the cancer has spread. You'll get imaging tests to take pictures of other organs and body structures. If you get surgery to remove the tumor, the surgeon might find cancer that didn't show up on other tests. These drugs block the abnormal ALK protein and shrink lung tumors linked to it. Your doctor might call this \"targeted therapy\" because it zooms in on the cancer cells and disrupts their growth. You should only take these drugs if a FISH test shows you have the mutation. These drugs won't cure you, but they should improve quality of life. If this happens, or if the cancer spreads, you may need to switch to another ALK inhibitor. Like all medicines, these drugs can cause other problems. A small number of people get pneumonitis, an inflammation of the tissue in the walls of their lungs. If you get it, your doctor will likely tell you to stop taking the drug. Before you take these drugs, your doctor may run an EKG to test your heart health. ALK inhibitors have been linked to changes in the heartbeat or heart rate that aren't explained by other health problems or medications. Your doctor might start you on chemotherapy before you get tested for the ALK rearrangement. If you're ALK-positive and already on chemo, some experts say you should stick with it for several cycles - as long as you can handle it and the cancer doesn't spread.

Practitioners of healing touch use their hands in an attempt to change a person's energy flow and restore health. Like other complementary medicines, healing touch starts with the idea that people are naturally healthy. The aim of healing touch is to focus (or channel) healing energy to restore natural health. People use healing touch to help treat many diseases. Supporters of healing touch believe it is especially helpful for healing wounds, curing infections, and relieving pain and anxiety. Some research studies have shown that, like yoga and meditation, healing touch reduces anxiety and stress. Little research has been done on the effects of healing touch, and it is a difficult form of therapy to study using traditional scientific techniques."], [618, "Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type IV (SCAIV)", "The term olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) has historically been used to describe a group of disorders that affect the central nervous system and are termed neurodegenerative diseases because they result in a progressive deterioration of nerve cells in certain parts of the brain. These conditions are characterized by progressive balance problems (disequilibrium), progressive impairment of the ability to coordinate voluntary movements (cerebellar ataxia), and difficulty speaking or slurred speech (dysarthria). OPCA has been classified based on clinical, genetic, and neuropathological findings and there is significant controversy and confusion in the medical literature because of its association with two distinct groups of disorders, specifically multiple system atrophy (MSA) and spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). Hereditary OPCA usually refers to the group of disorders that overlap with SCA. Some individuals with sporadic OPCA will develop MSA and this disorder is discussed in detail in the NORD report on MSA."], [619, "Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type III (SCA 3)", "Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD-III), also called spinocerebellar ataxia type III, is a rare, inherited, ataxia (lack of muscular control) affecting the central nervous system and characterized by the slow degeneration of particular areas of the brain called the hindbrain. The onset of symptoms of MJD varies from early teens to late adulthood. Three forms of Machado-Joseph Disease are recognized: Types MJD-I, MJD-II, and MJD-III."], [620, "Spinal Stenosis", "This topic is about spinal stenosis of the lower back, also known as the lumbar area. If you need information on spinal stenosis of the neck, see the topic Cervical Spinal Stenosis. Lumbar spinal stenosis is a narrowing of the spinal canal in the lower back, known as the lumbar area. This usually happens when bone or tissue-or both-grow in the openings in the spinal bones. This growth can squeeze and irritate nerves that branch out from the spinal cord . The result can be pain, numbness, or weakness, most often in the legs, feet, and buttocks. It's most often caused by changes that can happen as people age. For example: Connective tissues called ligaments get thicker. Arthritis leads to the growth of bony spurs that push on the nerves that branch out from the spinal cord. Discs between the bones may be pushed backward into the spinal canal. Symptoms may include: Numbness, weakness, cramping, or pain in the legs, feet, or buttocks. These symptoms get worse when you walk, stand straight, or lean backward. The pain gets better when you sit down or lean forward. Low back pain. Your doctor can tell if you have it by asking questions about your symptoms and past health and by doing a physical exam. You will probably need imaging tests such as an MRI, a CT scan, and sometimes X-rays. You can most likely control mild to moderate symptoms with pain medicines, exercise, and physical therapy. Your doctor may also give you a spinal shot of corticosteroid, a medicine that reduces inflammation. You may need surgery if your symptoms get worse or if they limit what you can do. Surgery to remove bone and tissue that are squeezing the nerve roots can help relieve leg pain and allow you to get back to normal activity. But it may not help back pain as much. What are the symptoms?"], [621, "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)", "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) most often affects babies and children and makes it hard for them to use their muscles. When your child has SMA, there's a breakdown of the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The brain stops sending messages that control muscle movement. When that happens, your child's muscles get weak and shrink, and he can have trouble controlling head movement, sitting without help, and even walking. In some cases he can have trouble swallowing and breathing as the disease progresses. There are different types of SMA, and how serious it is depends on which type your child has. There's no cure, but treatments can improve some symptoms and in some cases help your child live longer. Researchers are working to find new ways to fight the disease. Keep in mind that every child or adult who has SMA will have a different experience. No matter how much your child's movement is limited, the disease doesn't affect his intelligence in any way. If your child has SMA, it's because he's got two copies of a broken gene, one from each parent. If your child gets a faulty gene from just one of you, he won't get SMA but will be a carrier of the disease. When your child grows up he could pass the broken gene to his child. He may not be able to support his head or sit without help. This can be the reason for decreased fetal movement and contractures at birth The biggest concern is weakness in the muscles that control breathing. Keep in touch with your medical team, family members, clergy, and others who can help give you the emotional support you need while your child fights this disease. The symptoms range from moderate to severe and usually involve the legs more than the arms. Your child may be able to sit and walk or stand with help. This form of SMA starts when you're an adult. You'll have the symptoms throughout your life, but you can keep moving and even get better with exercises that you'll practice with the help of a physical therapist. It's important to remember that there's a lot of variation in the way this type of SMA affects people. Ask your doctor about ways to meet with others who have the same condition and know what you're going through. SMA can sometimes be hard to diagnose because the symptoms may be similar to other conditions. Your doctor may also order some tests that can help make a diagnosis. For example, he may take a blood sample from your child to check for missing or broken genes that can cause SMA. Your doctor puts small patches on your child's skin and sends electrical impulses through the nerves to check if they are sending messages to the muscles. This is a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures of the inside of your child's body. This uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of organs and structures inside your child. In this test, the doctor removes cells through a needle in the muscle or through a small cut in your child's skin. Nusinersen (Spinraza) has been shown to reduce the risk of death or permanent ventilator. It has also proven to help infants make significant headway in achieving motor milestones. Other options for your child's treatment depends on his symptoms and the type of SMA he has. The goal is to help your child move better and be as independent as possible. While your child is getting treatment, you can let him take part in as many activities for his age group as possible. With SMA, especially types 1 and 2, weak muscles keep air from moving easily in and out of the lungs. For severe problems, your child may use a machine that helps him breathe. When muscles in the mouth and throat are weak, babies and children with SMA can have a hard time sucking and swallowing. In that situation, your child may not get good nutrition and may have trouble growing. Physical and occupational therapy, which use exercises and regular daily activities, can help protect your child's joints and keep muscles strong. Special tools can control computers and phones and help with writing and drawing. When SMA starts in childhood, children can develop curves in their spines. Taking Care of Your Child There's a lot you can do as a family to help your child with some of the basic tasks of daily life. A team of doctors, therapists, and support groups can help you with your child's care and let him keep up with friendships and activities with your family. Nutritionists, experts in getting the right food your child needs to stay healthy. Physical therapists, people trained in using exercise to improve your child's motion. Check for support groups that can let you share your experiences with others who are in similar situations. The outlook depends on when symptoms started and how severe they are. If your child has type 1, the most severe form of SMA, he may start having symptoms anywhere from birth to age 6 months. You'll start to notice that his development is delayed and he may not be able to sit up or crawl. Even though children with this type usually don't live beyond age 2, with help from your doctors and support team, you can make his life comfortable. In other types of SMA, doctors can work to ease symptoms of children for many years, and in many cases throughout his life. Keep in mind that every child or adult who has SMA will have a different experience. A treatment plan that's made just for your child can help him keep up a better quality of life. Researchers are also working to find new drugs that improve symptoms. Getting Support You can get insights from parents who have kids with SMA on the web site of Fight SMA. The Muscular Dystrophy Association web site has information and links to services and support groups in your area that can help if you are facing SMA."], [622, "Spinal meningitis", "Meningitis is a rare infection that affects the delicate membranes -- called meninges -- that cover the brain and spinal cord. There are several types of this disease, including bacterial, viral, and fungal. Viral meningitis tends to be less severe, and most people recover completely without treatment. It usually only happens in people who have a weakened immune system -- the body's defense against germs. Meningitis is almost always caused by a bacterial or viral infection that begins somewhere else in the body besides the brain, like your ears, sinuses, or throat. The most common ones that bring on the disease in the U.S. are: Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) Listeria monocytogenes (in older people, pregnant women, or those with immune system problems) A bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) was a common cause of meningitis in babies and young children until the Hib vaccine became available for infants. There are also vaccines for Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The bacteria that cause meningitis can spread when people who are infected cough or sneeze. There are a number of viruses that can trigger the disease, including several that can cause diarrhea. Fungal meningitis is much less common than the other two types of the disease. Someone with a problem with the immune system -- because of AIDS, for example -- is more likely to become infected with this form of meningitis. Anyone can get meningitis, but research shows it's more common in these age groups: Children under 5 Teenagers and young adults ages 16-25 Adults over 55 Meningitis is more of a danger for people with certain medical conditions, such as a damaged or missing spleen, long-term disease, or immune system disorders.

Children with bladder control problems may need help using a catheter each day to prevent infection and kidney damage. To help prevent bowel problems, parents usually begin working with the doctor or nurse on managing bowel care as soon as the child starts eating solid food. As children with severe spina bifida grow, other treatments and surgeries may be needed to manage problems that arise. There are many ways you can support your child: Go to all scheduled doctor visits. Help your child be active, and encourage him or her to be as independent as possible. Encourage your child to drink plenty of fluids and eat foods high in fiber, such as whole grains and fruits. Check your child's skin each day for cuts, bruises, and pressure sores. Children with spina bifida often have weak eye muscles. Keep your child away from latex products if he or she has a latex allergy. Watch for learning difficulties, and talk to your child's doctor or teacher if you have any concerns. When your child is ready to start school, talk with teachers and other school workers. Take good care of yourself so you can stay healthy and have the energy to enjoy your child. And reach out to family, friends, and support groups when you need help. Before and during pregnancy, a woman can help prevent spina bifida in her child. All foods made from grains and sold in the United States have folic acid added. Foods rich in folic acid include fortified breakfast cereals and breads, spinach, and oranges. Your doctor may recommend that you also take a daily vitamin with folic acid or a folic acid supplement. If you take medicine for seizures or acne, talk with your doctor before you get pregnant. For example, don't use a sauna or hot tub."], [640, "Spielmeyer-Vogt Disease", "Batten disease, a rare genetic disorder, belongs to a group of progressive degenerative neurometabolic disorders known as the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses. The NCLs are characterized by abnormal accumulation of certain fatty, granular substances (i.e., pigmented lipids [lipopigments] ceroid and lipofuscin) within nerve cells (neurons) of the brain as well as other tissues of the body that may result in progressive deterioration (atrophy) of certain areas of the brain, neurological impairment, and other characteristic symptoms and physical findings. The symptoms of Batten disease usually become apparent between 5 and 15 years of age when progressive loss of vision, seizures, and progressive neurological degeneration develop. For years, the term Batten disease was used to describe the chronic juvenile form of NCL (JNCL). Recently, some researchers have begun using the term Batten disease to encompass all types of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses."], [641, "Spider Veins", "Varicose veins are large, raised, swollen blood vessels that twist and turn. They usually develop in the legs and can be seen through the skin. Spider veins are smaller, red, purple, and blue vessels that also twist and turn. Spider veins are easily visible through the skin, as well. They are typically visible on the legs and face. A number of factors predispose a person to varicose veins and spider veins. These include: Heredity Occupations that involve a lot of standing, such as nurses, hair stylists, teachers, and factory workers Obesity Hormonal influences of pregnancy, puberty, and menopause The use of birth control pills Postmenopausal hormonal replacement A history of blood clots Conditions that cause increased pressure in the abdomen, such as tumors, constipation, and externally worn garments like girdles. Other reported causes include trauma or injury to the skin, previous vein surgery, and exposure to ultraviolet rays. Many people with varicose veins complain of pain, described as an aching or cramping in the legs. Other common symptoms include tiredness, restlessness, burning, throbbing, tingling, or heaviness in the legs. In women, symptoms may be worse during certain parts of the menstrual cycle or during pregnancy. Less common is swelling, ulcers and a darkening of the skin, especially in the ankle region. Occasionally, varicose veins can form a painful blood clot with inflammation of the vein, a condition called thrombophlebitis. There are seven major forms of treatment for varicose veins and spider veins: 1. The most conservative approach is simply to wear properly-fitting support hose, especially when the veins cause painful or uncomfortable symptoms. They come in below-the-knee, above-the-knee, and pantyhose styles. This procedure uses a highly concentrated saline (salt) solution or a specially made detergent that is injected directly into the vein, causing the vein to disappear gradually over three to six weeks. The procedure is simple, relatively inexpensive, and can be performed in an outpatient setting. Endovenous laser treatment is a procedure in which a small laser fiber is inserted into the vein. Pulses of laser light are delivered inside the vein, which causes the vein to collapse. A small catheter is inserted into the vein. The catheter delivers radiofrequency energy to the vein wall, causing it to heat, collapse, and seal shut. The procedure is generally done in an outpatient or office setting, sometimes under local anesthesia. Surgical techniques to treat varicose veins include ligation (tying off of a vein) and stripping (removal of a long segment of vein). Another procedure, ambulatory phlebectomy, allows for the removal of large surface veins through very small incisions that do not need stitches. Surface laser or intense pulsed light treatments, such as Vasculight and PhotoDerm, are other options. An advantage of these treatments is that no needles or sclerosing solutions are required; however, there may be some minor discomfort. Side effects do occur, including discoloration or staining and blister formation. Many insurance companies cover the cost of treating varicose veins, but generally not spider veins."], [642, "Spider Bite, Brown Recluse", "Brown recluse, violin, or fiddleback (Loxosceles) spiders are about 0.5 in.

Apply a cool, wet cloth to the bite, or cover the bite with a cloth and apply an ice bag. A brown recluse bite can be serious and may require immediate medical care. A brown recluse spider bite is diagnosed through a physical examination and questions about the bite. You should be prepared to describe the spider, where and when the bite took place, and what you were doing at the time. (If you are able to safely capture and transport the spider, bring it with you to show your doctor.) Your doctor will ask what your main symptoms are, when they began, and how they have developed, progressed, or changed since the bite. Medicine to counteract brown recluse spider venom is not available in the United States or Canada. For bites that: Do not develop open sores, treatment includes applying a cold compress, elevating the bite area, and avoiding moving the bite area. Cause an open sore (ulcer) and dead skin (necrosis), treatment includes removing the dead skin from the sore. This may involve follow-up and replacing the dead skin with new skin (skin grafts). NSAIDs include naproxen (Aleve) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)."], [643, "Spider Bite, Black Widow", "Black widow spiders (Latrodectus mactans and Latrodectus hesperus) are found throughout the United States, Mexico, and southern Canada. A female black widow is much more likely to deliver more venom than a male spider.

Female black widows are usually about 1.5 in. (3.8 cm) long, but they may be smaller. Black widow spiders are frequently found in low-lying webs in garages, in barbecue grills, around swimming pools, and in wood piles. Most bites occur in rural and suburban areas and occur between the months of April and October. These spiders tend to bite defensively when their webs are disturbed. In most cases of a black widow spider bite, symptoms consist only of: Minimal to sharp pain followed by swelling and redness at the site of the bite. Severe belly, back, or chest pain. If you believe you have been bitten by a black widow spider: Get medical help immediately. Try to positively identify the spider or catch it to confirm its type.

This leads to the abnormal accumulation of these substances within various tissues of the body, including brain tissue. NPC can range from a fatal disorder within the first few months after birth (neonatal period) to a late onset, chronic progressive disorder that remains undiagnosed well into adulthood. Most cases are detected during childhood and progress to cause life-threatening complications by the second or third decade of life. NPC is caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene (NPC type 1C) or the NPC2 gene (NPC type 2C) and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Introduction NPC belongs to a larger group of more than 50 disorders known as lysosomal storage disorders. Abnormal functioning of a transport protein leads to the accumulation of cholesterol and other fatty substances in various tissues of the body, including brain tissue. NPC used to be grouped together with two other disorders, named Niemann-Pick disease type A and Niemann-Pick disease type B. Niemann-Pick disease types A and B are now considered a distinct disorder called acid sphingomyelinase deficiency.

Although the cause of a spermatocele is often unknown, it may be caused by obstruction of the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles (epididymal ducts). As part of the exam, your doctor will shine a light behind each testicle (transillumination) to check for solid masses that may be caused by other problems, such as cancer of the testicle. Light will not pass through solid masses that may be caused by other problems, such as cancer of the testicle. Spermatoceles are not usually dangerous and are treated only when they cause pain or embarrassment or when they decrease the blood supply to the penis (rare).

Speech is making the sounds that become words-the physical act of talking. Language is our system of using words to communicate. It includes using words and gestures to say what we mean, and understanding what others say. Speech and language milestones help tell whether a child is developing as expected. Milestones are certain skills, such as babbling, saying \"mama\" or \"dada,\" or putting two words together. Usually, a child needs to master one milestone before reaching the next. Babies usually start cooing at around 2 months and are babbling by about 6 months. A child usually speaks in gibberish, called jargon, by the first birthday. At 15 to 18 months, a typical toddler understands much more than he or she is able to put into words. Starting around 18 months, many children have a burst in talking. By 24 months, children tend to use at least 50 words and are also starting to use two-word phrases. A child who is surrounded by speech and language all the time usually learns language skills faster. Talking to and reading to your child will have a big effect on how well your child is able to communicate later. Children who are seldom spoken to or read to usually learn to talk later than other children their age. Sometimes there is a reason that a child has a speech and language problem. For instance, a child may have a language delay because of trouble hearing or because of a developmental disorder such as autism. It's important to track your child's speech and language development. A child can overcome many speech and language problems with treatment, especially when you catch problems early. Your doctor will check your child's speech and language skills during regular well-child visits. But call your doctor anytime you have concerns about how your child is developing.

Your symptoms may be worse or better from day to day, but your IBS will not get worse over time. IBS doesn't cause more serious diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease or cancer. The cause may be different for different people. IBS may be caused by problems with the way signals are sent between the brain and the digestive tract , problems digesting certain foods, and stress or anxiety. People with IBS may have unusually sensitive intestines or problems with the way the muscles of the intestines move. For some people with IBS, certain foods, stress, hormonal changes, and some antibiotics may trigger pain and other symptoms. The main symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome are belly pain with constipation or diarrhea. Other common symptoms are bloating, mucus in the stools, and a feeling that you have not completely emptied your bowels. Many people with IBS go back and forth between having constipation and having diarrhea. IBS is quite common, but most people's symptoms are so mild that they never see a doctor for treatment. Some people may have troublesome symptoms, especially stomach cramps, bloating, and diarrhea. Because there are no structural problems in the intestines of people who have IBS, some people may think this means that the symptoms \"are all in their head.\" The pain, discomfort, and bloating are real. Most of the time, doctors can diagnose irritable bowel syndrome from the symptoms. In some cases, you may need other tests, such as stool analysis or blood tests. These tests can help your doctor rule out other problems that might be causing your symptoms.

For more information, see the topic Sleep Apnea. You snore when the flow of air from your mouth or nose to your lungs makes the tissues of your throat vibrate when you sleep. Loud snoring can make it hard for you and your partner to get a good night's sleep. You may not know that you snore. Your bed partner may notice the snoring and that you sleep with your mouth open. If snoring keeps you or your bed partner from getting a good night's sleep, one or both of you may feel tired during the day. Snoring may point to other medical problems, such as obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep apnea can be a serious problem, because you stop breathing at times during sleep. So if you snore often, talk to your doctor about it. When you sleep, the muscles in the back of the roof of your mouth (soft palate), tongue, and throat relax. If they relax too much, they narrow or block your airway. As you breathe, your soft palate and uvula vibrate and knock against the back of your throat. This causes the sounds you hear during snoring. The tonsils and adenoids may also vibrate. The narrower the airway is, the more the tissue vibrates, and the louder the snoring is. You may be able to treat snoring by making changes in your lifestyle and in the way you prepare for sleep. Sleep on your side and not your back. Limit your use of alcohol and medicines such as sedatives before you go to bed. If a stuffy nose makes your snoring worse, use decongestants or nasal corticosteroid sprays to help you breathe. Try using devices that you attach to the outside of your nose to help with breathing while you sleep. When you sleep, use a device in your mouth that helps you breathe easier. If these treatments don't work, you may be able to use a machine that helps you breathe while you sleep. In rare cases, your doctor may suggest surgery to open your airway.

You can't \"catch\" SLL like you do a cold or infection. They do know, though, that the disease is rare in people under 50. A few things are linked to a higher risk of getting SLL: You have a condition that causes you to have a weak immune system, like HIV/AIDS. You live or work in a farming community. You might not have any obvious symptoms when you're diagnosed with SLL. When symptoms appear, they may include: Painless swelling in the neck, armpit, or groin Loss of appetite Fatigue Night sweats Fever Weight loss Your doctor will do a physical exam and may ask you questions such as: Have you ever noticed any swelling in your neck, armpit, or groin? Your doctor may also ask you to get a lymph node biopsy. Your doctor removes the lymph node and checks it under a microscope for signs of cancer. Many lymph nodes are near the surface of your skin. If that's the case, your doctor will give you a shot that numbs your skin. You'll have a small wound with a few stitches that can be removed in about a week. Your doctor may also do two bone marrow tests -- a bone marrow aspiration and a biopsy -- to find out how advanced your cancer is. They are usually done together as part of a single procedure that removes marrow from the back of your hip bone. For a bone marrow aspiration, your doctor first numbs the skin over your hip and the surface of the bone. He then inserts a thin needle into the bone and uses a syringe to suck out a small amount of liquid bone marrow. What kind of follow-up care and monitoring will I need? If you have no symptoms, your doctor might recommend \"watchful waiting.\" During this period, he'll monitor you and start treatment if the disease starts to get worse. If you need treatment, you have several options: Chemotherapy. The medicine comes in pill form or may be given through an IV. Chemotherapy is a key treatment for SLL and can often put the disease in remission, which means you no longer have any signs of cancer, although it can return. This uses high energy X-rays to kill cancer cells in one or two groups of lymph nodes in the same part of the body. It may be useful if you're in the earlier stages of SLL and the disease hasn't spread. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for you. Besides new drugs, another treatment that may be part of a clinical trial is a stem cell transplant. Stem cells are in the news a lot, but usually when you hear about them they're referring to \"embryo\" stem cells that are used in cloning. The stem cells in a transplant are different. They live in your bone marrow and help make new blood cells. This procedure may use your own stem cells or stem cells from a donor. If a donor supplies them, you'll need to find one who is the right match for you, so your body doesn't reject the new stem cells, or start fighting them the way it would fight an infection. Close relatives, such as your brother or sister, are the best chance for a good match. If that doesn't work out, you need to get on a list of potential donors from strangers. Sometimes the best chance for the right stem cells for you will be from someone who's the same race or ethnicity as you. Before the transplant, you'll most likely need to get treated with high doses of chemo for about a week or two. This can be a tough process, because you may get side effects like nausea and mouth sores. You won't feel any pain from this, and you're awake while it's happening. After your transplant, it could take 2 to 6 weeks for the stem cells to multiply and start making new blood cells. During this time you may be in the hospital, or at the very least, will need to make visits every day to get checked by your transplant team. It can take 6 months to a year until the number of normal blood cells in your body gets back to what it should be. Ask your doctor about which vaccinations you should receive, such as shots to prevent flu and pneumonia. Living with a serious illness poses many challenges, both physically and emotionally. They can offer comfort, as well as practical support. You may also find it helpful to talk to a professional counselor, spiritual leader, or a support group. After initial treatment for SLL, many people have a period of remission, when there are no signs of active disease. Treatment for disease that returns can be successful, and you may have another period of remission.

The small intestine (also called \"small bowel\") connects your stomach to your large intestine. Its main job is to break down and absorb food, fats, vitamins, and other substances your body needs. If you have this type of cancer, tumor cells may block the small intestine. There are five types of small intestine cancer: Adenocarcinomas. An adenocarcinoma starts in the lining of the small intestine. At first, it may look like a small, noncancerous growth called a polyp, but over time it can turn into cancer. Cancerous cells develop in the soft tissue of the small intestine. These slow-growing cancers often take root in the lower section of the small intestine. These tumors give off large amounts of certain body chemicals, like serotonin. This is a rare form of small intestine cancer. A lymphoma is a cancer that starts in the lymph nodes. That means your body's natural defense system is weakened and may not fight infection and disease the way it should. But they do know that several things can increase your chances of getting the disease: How old you are (average age at diagnosis is 60) Your sex (slightly higher risk in men) Genetics (some disorders you're born with raise the odds) Smoking and alcohol use High-fat diet Living or working near large quantities of some chemicals, like phenoxyacetic acid Other conditions that affect your gut, like Crohn's, colon cancer, or celiac disease Lymphedema (damage to the vessels that connect to the lymph nodes) See your doctor if you notice any of the following signs, which could be caused by small intestine cancer or something else: Pain or cramps in the middle of your stomach Losing weight for no known reason A lump in your abdomen Blood in your stool Your doctor will do a thorough medical exam. He'll ask about your medical history and any problems you may be having. These create pictures of your small bowel so he can see if there's cancer and whether it has spread. That's a procedure where your doctor looks at the inside of your esophagus, stomach, and first part of your small intestine. To do this, he'll use an endoscope -- a thin, tubelike instrument that has a light and camera at the end of it. Other tests your doctor might order include the following: Blood chemistry tests. Your doctor checks your blood to measure substances released by your liver (and how much). Your doctor removes a piece of your lymph node to check for cancer cells. A doctor cuts into the wall of your abdomen to look for signs of disease. Which treatment your doctor recommends will depend on a number of things, like what type of cancer it is and whether it has spread. Your surgeon may remove the part of the small intestine that contains cancer. Or he may do \"bypass\" surgery so that food can go around a tumor that can't be removed. Even if your doctor takes out all of the cancer during surgery, he may still suggest radiation therapy. A number of new therapies are being tested, as well.

Patients learn to walk, may fall frequently and may have trouble walking up and down stairs at 2-3 years of age; some patients will not show functional changes until the teens. Kugelberg Welander syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Molecular genetic testing has revealed that all types of autosomal recessive SMA (Werndnig-Hoffman disease, juvenile SMA and Kugelberg-Welander disease) are caused by mutations in the SMN (survival motor neuron) gene on chromosome 5. Deletion of the NAIP (neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein) gene that is close to the SMN gene is also associated with SMA. The relationship between specific mutations in the SMN gene and nearby genes and the severity of SMA is still being investigated so classification of SMA subdivisions is based on age of onset of symptoms and maximum function achieved as opposed to the genetic profile."], [667, "SMA", "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a group of inherited disorders characterized by a loss of certain nerve cells in the spinal cord called motor neurons or anterior horn cells. The loss of motor neurons leads to progressive muscle weakness and muscle wasting (atrophy) in muscles closest to the trunk of the body (proximal muscles) such as the shoulders, hips and back. The more severe types of SMA can affect muscles involved in feeding, swallowing and breathing.

If your heart beats less than 60 times a minute, it is slower than normal. A slow heart rate can be normal and healthy. For some people, a slow heart rate does not cause any problems. Healthy young adults and athletes often have heart rates of less than 60 beats a minute. In other people, bradycardia is a sign of a problem with the heart's electrical system. It means that the heart's natural pacemaker isn't working right or that the electrical pathways of the heart are disrupted. Men and women age 65 and older are most likely to develop a slow heart rate that needs treatment. As a person ages, the electrical system of the heart often doesn't function normally. Some medicines for treating heart problems or high blood pressure, such as beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics, and digoxin. A very slow heart rate may cause you to: Feel dizzy or lightheaded. Feel short of breath and find it harder to exercise. Have chest pain or a feeling that your heart is pounding or fluttering (palpitations). Faint, if a slow heart rate causes a drop in blood pressure. Some people don't have symptoms, or their symptoms are so mild that they think they are just part of getting older. You can find out how fast your heart is beating by taking your pulse . Your doctor may take your pulse to diagnose bradycardia. Your doctor might also do a physical exam, ask questions about your past health, and do an electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG). This lightweight device is also called a Holter monitor or a cardiac event monitor. You wear the monitor for a day or more, and it records your heart rhythm while you go about your daily routine. You may also have blood tests to find out if another problem is causing your slow heart rate. If bradycardia doesn't cause symptoms, it usually isn't treated. If damage to the heart's electrical system causes your heart to beat too slowly, you will probably need to have a pacemaker. A pacemaker is a device placed under your skin that helps correct the slow heart rate. People older than 65 are most likely to have a type of bradycardia that requires a pacemaker. If another medical problem, such as hypothyroidism or an electrolyte imbalance, is causing a slow heart rate, treating that problem may cure the bradycardia. If a medicine is causing your heart to beat too slowly, your doctor may adjust the dose or prescribe a different medicine. The goal of treatment is to raise your heart rate so your body gets the blood it needs. Bradycardia is often the result of another heart condition, so taking steps to live a heart-healthy lifestyle will usually improve your overall health. Losing weight if you need to, and staying at a healthy weight. Get emergency help if you fainted or if you have symptoms of a heart attack or have severe shortness of breath.

You have shortness of breath that is new or getting worse."], [671, "Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis", "A slipped capital femoral epiphysis occurs when the upper end of the thigh bone (femur) slips at the area where the bone is growing (growth plate or physis) and does not fit in the hip socket correctly. Rapid growth and an imbalance of hormones during adolescence may cause a slipped capital femoral epiphysis. Symptoms may include: Hip tenderness or pain and decreased movement during the early stages of the condition. Increased pain when the toes are turned in toward midline (internal rotation of the hip). Mild discomfort in the groin, thigh, or knee while walking or running. Sometimes knee pain is the first symptom. X-rays and sometimes CT scan or MRI are used to confirm a diagnosis of slipped capital femoral epiphysis. The goal of treatment for a slipped capital femoral epiphysis is to prevent further slippage, restore the normal position of the bones, and reduce complications of the condition. This often involves surgery to secure the growth plate (physis) with a single screw or with pins. In an osteotomy, the doctor cuts the bone at the top of the leg near the hip joint, moves the bone to a more normal position, then uses metal pins to hold it in place. The pins are usually left in the bone after it heals. Crutches may be used to take weight off the hip. After surgery, using crutches reduces pain and helps keep the hip stable and in good position as it heals. A slipped capital femoral epiphysis may lead to early degenerative arthritis of the hip if it is not detected early and treated properly. A slipped capital femoral epiphysis is the most common serious hip condition seen in teenagers. It is more common in boys than in girls and more common in very overweight teenagers."], [672, "Sleep Epilepsy", "Narcolepsy is a neurological sleep disorder characterized by chronic, excessive attacks of drowsiness during the day, sometimes called excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Attacks of drowsiness may persist for only a few seconds or several minutes. Three additional symptoms often associated with narcolepsy are sudden extreme muscle weakness (cataplexy), a specific type of hallucination that occurs just before falling asleep or upon awakening, and brief episodes of paralysis while waking up. The incidence of narcolepsy is approximately 1 in 2,000 and most researchers believe that the disorder remains undiagnosed or misdiagnosed in many cases. In narcolepsy, the immune system destroys certain brain cells that produce a peptide called hypocretin. Hypocretin impacts on many brain functions, but the details of its actions are not yet understood. Why the immune system attacks healthy cells in narcolepsy is unknown and additional environmental and genetic factors may play a role in the development of the disorder."], [673, "Skin Tags", "There are several skin lesions that are very common and benign (non-cancerous). These conditions include moles, freckles, skin tags, benign lentigines, and seborrheic keratoses. Moles occur when cells in the skin grow in a cluster instead of being spread throughout the skin. These cells are called melanocytes, and they make the pigment that gives skin its natural color. Moles may darken after exposure to the sun, during the teen years, and during pregnancy. A mole or freckle should be checked if it has a diameter of more than a pencil eraser or any characteristics of the ABCDEs of melanoma (see below). Dysplastic nevi are moles that are generally larger than average (larger than a pencil eraser) and irregular in shape. They tend to have uneven color with dark brown centers and lighter, uneven edges. In fact, people who have 10 or more dysplastic nevi have a 12 times higher chance of developing melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer. If you notice changes in a mole's color, height, size, or shape, you should have a dermatologist (skin doctor) evaluate it. Examine your skin with a mirror or ask someone to help you. Pay special attention to areas of the skin that are often exposed to the sun, such as the hands, arms, chest, neck, face, ears, legs, and back. If you see any signs of change in an existing mole, if you have a new mole, or if you want a mole to be removed for cosmetic reasons, talk to your dermatologist. The following ABCDEs are important characteristics to consider when examining moles. If a mole displays any of the signs listed below, have it checked immediately by a dermatologist. The border or edges of the mole are ragged, blurred, or irregular. The diameter of a mole is larger than the eraser of a pencil. The most common location for melanoma in men is the chest and back and in women, it is the lower leg. If a dermatologist believes a mole needs to be evaluated further, he or she will do a biopsy by shaving or cutting out the entire spot so that it can be evaluated under the microscope. (If the dermatologist thinks the mole might be cancerous, cutting through the mole will not cause the cancer to spread.) If the mole is found to be cancerous, the dermatologist will cut out the entire mole or scar from the biopsy site by cutting out the entire area and a rim of normal skin around it, and stitching the wound closed. A skin tag is a small flap of tissue that hangs off the skin by a connecting stalk. Skin tags appear most often in women, especially with weight gain, and in elderly people. However, they can become irritated if anything, such as clothing, jewelry, or skin rubs against them. Your dermatologist can remove a skin tag by cutting it off with a scalpel or scissors, with cryosurgery (freezing it off), or with electrosurgery (burning it off with an electric current). A lentigo (plural: lentigines) is a spot on the skin that is darker (usually brown) than the surrounding skin. Lentigines are more common among whites, especially those with fair skin. Exposure to the sun seems to be the major cause of lentigines. Lentigines most often appear on parts of the body that get the most sun, including the face and hands. Some lentigines may be caused by genetics (family history) or by medical procedures such as radiation therapy. There are several methods for treating lentigines: Cryosurgery (freezing it off) Laser surgery Skin creams such as retinoids and bleaching agents The best way to prevent lentigines is to stay out of the sun as much as possible, especially between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 when outdoors, and wear protective clothing, such as long-sleeved shirts, pants, and a wide-brimmed hat. Freckles are small brown spots usually found on the face, neck, chest, and arms. They are more often seen in the summer, especially among lighter-skinned people and people with light or red hair. Causes of freckles include genetics and exposure to the sun. Since freckles are almost always harmless, there is no need to treat them. As with many skin conditions, it's best to avoid the sun as much as possible, or use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30. This is especially important because people who freckle easily (for example, lighter-skinned people) are more likely to develop skin cancer. If you feel that your freckles are a problem or you don't like the way they look, you can cover them up with makeup or consider certain types of laser treatment, liquid nitrogen treatment or chemical peels. Seborrheic keratoses are brown or black growths usually found on the chest and back, as well as on the head. If you decide to have seborrheic keratoses removed because you don't like the way they look, or because they are chronically irritated by clothing, methods for removing them include cutting them off, cryosurgery, and electrosurgery."], [674, "Smoking Cessation How to Quit Smoking", "But choosing the best way to quit is a good first step to ensure you stick with it. As you probably know, there are many different ways to quit smoking. Consider which of these might work for you: Cold turkey (no outside help). This involves working with a counselor to find ways not to smoke. Together, you'll find your triggers (such as emotions or situations that make you want to smoke) and make a plan to get through the cravings. Nicotine replacement therapy. Nicotine gum, patches, inhalers, sprays, and lozenges are nicotine replacement therapies. They work by giving you nicotine without the use of tobacco. You may be more likely to quit with nicotine replacement therapy, but it works best when combined with behavioral therapy and lots of support from friends and family. And remember that the goal is to end your addiction to nicotine, not simply to quit using tobacco. Bupropion (Zyban) and varenicline (Chantix) are prescription medications that can help with your cravings and symptoms from withdrawals. Using a combination of treatment methods might increase your chances of quitting. For example, using both a nicotine patch and gum may be better than a patch alone. Other combination treatments that are helpful include behavioral therapy and nicotine replacement therapy; prescription medication used together a nicotine replacement therapy patch; and a nicotine replacement therapy patch and nicotine spray.The FDA hasn't approved using 2 types of nicotine replacement therapies at the same time, so be sure to talk with your doctor first to see if this is the right approach for you. No matter which method you choose, an important part of quitting is to build the quit plan that works for you. Pick a quit date that gives you time to prepare without losing your motivation. Tell friends and family that you are quitting. Get rid of all cigarettes and ashtrays from your home, work, and car. Figure out your smoking triggers, and decide how you're going to deal with them. There will be days when all you want to do is give in to your cravings. Quitting will be the best thing you ever do for yourself, but you have stick with your plan. And avoid situations that normally make you want to smoke, especially during the first 3 months. This is when you're most likely to start smoking again. You'll probably feel irritable, depressed, slow, and tired, especially if you're quitting cold turkey. Every time you don't smoke when you have a craving, your chances of quitting go up. Change your habits; replace the oral fixation with something else like eating carrot sticks or sunflower seeds. Do something that keeps your hands active and reduces stress, like walking your dog. As much as you want to quit smoking, you may be surprised to feel sad or miss it. Just don't let that feeling make you want to smoke. Everyone is different, and how tough it will be for you depends on: How many cigarettes you smoke daily If your friends and family members smoke Why you smoke Focus on the benefits. Within hours of quitting, your body starts to recover from the effects of nicotine and additives. Your blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature -- all of which are higher than they should be because of the nicotine in cigarettes -- return to healthier levels. The level of poisonous carbon monoxide in your blood drops, so your blood can carry more oxygen. It's called a relapse, and it happens to a lot of people before they kick the habit for good.

These could all be signs you have a bowel obstruction, which is a serious problem that happens when something blocks your bowel, either your large or small intestine. A common type of obstruction, or blockage, is called fecal impaction. When the bowel is blocked by something other than hard stool, doctors call it a bowel obstruction. There are different ways that your bowel could become blocked: Part of your bowel may become twisted, which can close it off and stop anything from passing through. Scar tissue or a hernia could make your bowel too narrow for anything to pass through. A tumor or other type of growth inside your bowel could block the passage. Damaged blood vessels leading to the bowel can cause some bowel tissue to die. If the bowel's muscle walls become paralyzed (unable to move), they can't move anything along. In many cases, inflammation, prior surgeries, or cancer can cause the bowel obstruction. Bowel obstructions can happen in your small or large intestine, but they're more likely to be in the small intestine. Common causes are: Crohn's disease Diverticulitis Hernia Colon cancer Stomach cancer Ovarian cancer Scar tissue from surgery Radiation to the abdominal area Advanced lung cancer, breast cancer, or melanoma that has spread to the bowel Signs of an intestinal blockage will depend on how bad the obstruction is.

She may also send you to have a CT scan, because it's likely to show a blockage if you have one. Sometimes a bowel obstruction can appear on an X-ray, so your doctor may ask you to get X-rays of your abdomen instead. It will spread into your bowels and appear on an X-ray as a bright area. If there's a blocked area, the barium may show it. If you have a complete blockage of your bowel, you will likely have to be hospitalized for treatment, which typically includes surgery or a procedure to open up the blockage. If you're healthy enough for surgery, you may need to have the area causing the blockage removed. The surgeon also will remove any tissue in your bowel that has died due to lack of blood flow.

Here are some things to consider to help you succeed: Using nicotine replacement products and/or medicine doubles your chances of quitting.1 When you quit smoking, your body craves the nicotine that it was used to getting when you smoked. But the nicotine isn't the harmful part of smoking or chewing. It's all the other things in tobacco that are bad for you, such as tar and carbon monoxide. Other medicines that can help are bupropion (Zyban) and varenicline (Chantix). Support can help you through the stress of losing this part of your life. Your doctor can prescribe medicines that can get you through withdrawal. And he or she can help you plan the best way to use nicotine replacement products and can refer you to counseling programs. Friends and family (especially those who used to smoke) can provide shoulders to lean on, and they can encourage you to stay smoke-free. They can help distract you when you want to smoke, and they can understand when you're a bit grouchy.

You can buy gum, patches, and lozenges without a prescription. This is a non-nicotine prescription medicine that reduces withdrawal symptoms and cravings. This prescription medicine helps withdrawal symptoms and cravings, and it reduces the pleasure you feel from smoking. Remember, taking medicines and using telephone or in-person counseling or a quit-smoking program at the same time greatly increases your chances of success. A slip or relapse is just a sign that you need to change your approach to quitting. A slip of just one or two cigarettes can lead back to regular smoking, but many smokers can get back to not smoking by changing their plan. For example, they may add counseling or a medicine. And think about when you want to try again, such as next week, next month, or next spring. If you're still motivated to quit, you can try again as soon as you want.

This can be a sore that does not heal or a change in a mole or skin growth. These changes usually happen in areas that get the most sun-your head, neck, back, chest, or shoulders. Your doctor will use a biopsy to find out if you have skin cancer. This means taking a sample of the growth and sending it to a lab to see if it contains cancer cells.

It also comes from exposure to artificial sources of UV, such as indoor tanning. If you have light skin that sunburns easily, you are more likely to get skin cancer. Your risk is higher if you are male or if you are over 40. Your risk is higher if others in your family have had it or if you have had it before. You may also be more likely to get it if you have been exposed often to strong X-rays, to certain chemicals (such as arsenic, coal tar, and creosote), or to radioactive substances (such as radium). The most common way is to numb your skin so that it does not hurt, then cut out the cancer. Other treatments include radiation, medicines that are put on the skin (topical therapies), and photodynamic therapy (PDT).

The surgeon removes the tumor fully, along with a safe margin of surrounding tissue and possibly nearby lymph nodes. Chemotherapy, sometimes in combination with immunotherapy -- such as interferon, interleukin-2 -- is generally preferred. Immunotherapy is a field of cancer treatment that attempts to target and kill cancer cells by manipulating the body's immune system. Some of the most promising developments in the field of immunotherapy have arisen from efforts to cure advanced melanoma. Some researchers are treating advanced cases with vaccines, while others are using drugs such as interferon, interleukin-2, and ipilimumab (Yervoy) in an effort to stimulate immune cells into attacking melanoma cells more aggressively. In patients with advanced melanoma, two drugs, nivolumab (Opdivo) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda) have been found to be effective after use of ipilimumab. These drugs help block proteins on T cells that normally help keep them in check, therefore allowing these immune cells to attack melanoma cells. Each of these treatment approaches aims to immunize a patient's body against its own cancer -- something the body cannot do naturally. Called targeted therapy, these drugs include dabrafenib (Tafinlar), trametinib (Mekinist) and vemurafenib (Zelboraf). Anyone who has been treated for skin cancer of any kind should have a checkup at least twice a year. About 20% of skin cancer patients experience recurrence or a second separate tumor, often within the first two years after diagnosis. Alternative approaches may be useful in cancer prevention and in combating nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and headaches from chemotherapy, radiation, or immunotherapy used to treat advanced skin cancer. Skin experts know that the mineral zinc and the antioxidant vitamins A (beta-carotene), C, and E can help repair damaged body tissue and promote healthy skin. To test the theory, selected skin cancer patients are given experimental supplements of these vitamins in the hope of preventing cancer recurrence."], [696, "Skeletal abnormalities/joint dislocation...", "Summary Larsen syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that has been associated with a wide variety of different symptoms. The classic form of Larsen syndrome is caused by mutations of the FLNB gene. Introduction FLNB-related disorders are a group of disorders (including autosomal dominant Larsen syndrome) that occur due to mutations of the Filamin B gene (FLNB) gene. These disorders are characterized by skeletal abnormalities affecting the bones of the hands and feet, the bones of the spine (vertebrae), joint dislocations, and distinctive facial features. Researchers have identified individuals with multiple joint dislocations and skeletal anomalies whose condition appears to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Mutations in the carbohydrate sulfotransferase 3 (CHST3) gene have been identified in patients with so-called autosomal recessive Larsen syndrome that also includes humero-spinal dysostosis and spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia Omani type. Since these disorders are known to be caused by a different gene than classic, autosomal dominant Larsen syndrome, the term autosomal recessive Larsen syndrome should probably be avoided to prevent confusion with clinical disorders resulting from mutations in FLNB."], [697, "Sjogren's Syndrome", "When you have Sjogren's syndrome, your eyes, mouth, and other parts of your body get dried out. Sjogren's causes your immune system to go haywire and attack healthy cells instead of invading bacteria or viruses. Your white blood cells, which normally protect you from germs, attack the glands that are in charge of making moisture. When that happens, they can't produce tears and saliva. Dry eyes and dry mouth are the most common symptoms. You can sometimes get problems in other parts of your body, such as swollen glands around your face and neck, dry skin or nasal passages, or painful and stiff joints. About half of people with Sjogren's also have another autoimmune disease, like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. That can sometimes make it harder for your doctor to give you a diagnosis. You'll need to take medicine throughout your life to help you manage your symptoms. You can buy some kinds in a drugstore without a prescription, such as drops that keep your eyes moist. Your doctor can prescribe other drugs that boost the amount of saliva in your mouth. An infection with a bacteria or virus may be a trigger that sets the disease in motion. For example, let's say you have a defective gene that's linked to Sjogren's, and then you get an infection. But because of your faulty gene, your white blood cells target healthy cells in the glands that make saliva and tears. There's no let-up in the fight, so your symptoms will keep going unless you get treatment. The symptoms of Sjogren's vary a lot from person to person. The dryness can also lead to yeast infections in your mouth. Since you don't have enough saliva, which helps protect your teeth from decay, there's a chance you may get more cavities than other people. You could also get inflammation of your gums, called gingivitis. Your eyes may also burn, itch, or feel gritty. Sjogren's can sometimes affect other parts of your body. You may also get heartburn, a sensation of burning that moves from your stomach to your chest. It's rarer, but you could have other problems like inflammation in your lungs, liver, and kidneys. It can be tricky to diagnose Sjogren's syndrome, because the symptoms sometimes look a lot like some other diseases. To get clues, your doctor will give you a physical exam and may ask you questions such as: Do your eyes itch or burn often? Your doctor may ask you to get some blood tests. The blood tests can show if you have germ-fighting proteins (antibodies) that many people with Sjogren's have. They can also measure inflammation in your body, another sign that you have the disease. Your blood tests can also reveal if you have high amounts of proteins called immunoglobulins. A high level could be a sign of Sjogren's. For instance, drops called \"artificial tears\" can keep your eyes from drying out. There are also gels that you put on your eyes at night. The advantage of the gels is that they stick to your eye's surface, so you won't need to apply them as often as the drops. If artificial tears aren't helping, your doctor may prescribe drugs for your dry eyes, including: Lacrisert Restasis Lacrisert is tiny rod-shaped medicine. Restasis comes in the form of drops, which you use twice a day. To help your dry mouth, your doctor may prescribe drugs that boost the amount of your saliva, including: Evoxac (cevimeline) NeutraSal (supersaturated calcium phosphate rinse) Salagen (pilocarpine) There are other treatments for some of the less common symptoms of Sjogren's syndrome. For instance, if you get yeast infections in your mouth, your doctor might prescribe anti-fungal medicine. If you get heartburn, your doctor may give you medicines that curb the amount of acid in your stomach. Your doctor may also suggest a medicine called Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) to treat your joint pain. It's a drug that's also used to treat malaria, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis. It's rare, but some people with Sjogren's get symptoms throughout the body, including belly pain, fever, rashes, or lung and kidney problems. For those situations, doctors sometimes prescribe prednisone (a steroid) or an anti-inflammation drug called methotrexate. There are lots of steps you can take on your own to help manage your symptoms. For example, sipping water frequently can help a dry mouth. Chewing gum or sucking on a candy can stimulate saliva flow and help keep your mouth moist. Also ask your doctor, dentist, or pharmacist about mouthwashes or sprays that can relieve dryness. For dry eyes, a lot of people find that using a humidifier or vaporizer at night can help. These machines also can help your dry mouth or nose. Also for dry nose, try a nasal saline spray or gel. Instead of using a towel after showering, let yourself \"drip dry.\" It can help to get in touch with others who are going through the same thing. The Sjogren's Syndrome Foundation can connect you with others through support groups and conferences."], [698, "Sitz Bath", "When you take a sitz bath, you sit in warm water to help relieve pain in your bottom or around your private parts. Your doctor might suggest one if you have hemorrhoids, an anal fissure, or if you've just had a baby. A sitz bath is typically used as a home treatment for the following: Anal fissure, or small tear in the skin lining the opening of the anus Constipation or diarrhea Hemorrhoids A condition that affects the prostate gland called prostatitis After a vaginal delivery A sitz bath can offer relief from soreness, burning, and inflammation, but you may need other treatments as well. A pediatrician may suggest a sitz bath for a child with uncomfortable bowel movements, a skin reaction, or an injury in the genital area. If you're making a sitz bath in your tub: Fill the bathtub with about 2 to 3 inches of warm water. Sit in the tub, making sure your private area is covered. Afterward, gently pat the area dry using a soft towel. You can also dry off by using a hair dryer on a cool or low, warm setting. Medical supply stores, as well as pharmacies, sell small plastic tubs or basins that fit over a toilet seat, too."], [699, "Sickle Cell Crisis", "At some point in your life, you'll accidentally drop something into the sink. If it's small and of little value, like a grape, it may not be an issue. But if your kid slips a big piece of Lego down the drain, you're going to have some bigger problems when it gets stuck in your pipes. That's kind of like what happens during a sickle cell crisis. Red blood cells are usually round and have some give to them -- their shape lets them move easily throughout your body. But when you have sickle cell disease (SCD), some cells are curved -- like a sickle--and hard. They don't flow as easily, and they can get stuck in the small blood vessels of your chest, belly, and joints. The stuck cells slow or even totally block blood flow, so some parts of your body don't get the oxygen they need. But you can take steps to lower your chances of a crisis. And even when one comes on, you may be able to care for yourself at home. The most common sign is pain that might be dull, stabbing, throbbing, or sharp, and seems to come out of nowhere. Some people have crises here and there, while others may have them every month. You might feel the pain anywhere in your body and in more than one place, but it's often in your: Arms and legs Belly Chest Hands and feet (more typical in young children) Lower back You may also have: Breathing problems Extreme tiredness Headache or dizziness Painful erections in males Weakness or a hard time moving some parts of your body Yellowish skin color (jaundice) Typically, you won't know why you had a crisis, and there may be more than one cause. Possible triggers include: Being at high altitudes (mountain climbing, for example) Changes in temperature, like if you go from a warm house into a cold winter day and you haven't bundled up Illness Not having enough to drink (dehydration) Stress Two new drugs have shown promise. When a crisis first starts, your doctor will likely suggest you drink plenty of liquids and take an over-the-counter pain medicine, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. For example, if you have a kidney problem, acetaminophen might be the better choice. For more severe pain, your doctor may give you a stronger medicine. You can also try a heating pad, hot bath, or a massage. If you can't manage the pain at home, go to an emergency room, where they can give you stronger pain medicine. You may need to stay in the hospital until the pain is under control. There's no sure way, but you can lower your odds: Avoid swimming in cold water. Planes that don't control air pressure could cause you problems. Exercise, but drink plenty of liquids and don't push too hard. Manage any other health conditions you may have, like diabetes, with your doctor's help. Tell your doctor if you have any sleep problems, like snoring."], [700, "Should I have surgery for hammer, claw, ...", "A mallet toe bends down at the joint closest to the tip of the toe. It often affects the second toe, but it may happen in the other toes too. If you notice that your toe looks odd or hurts, talk to your doctor. You may be able to fix your toe with home treatment. If you don't treat the problem right away, you are more likely to need surgery. Wearing tight shoes can cause the toe muscles to get out of balance. If a shoe forces a toe to stay in a bent position for too long, the muscles tighten and the tendons shorten, or contract. Over time, the toe muscles can't straighten the toe, even when you aren't wearing shoes. Women are affected more often than men because they are more likely to wear shoes with narrow toes or high heels. Less often, these toe problems are linked with other conditions, such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, stroke, or an injury to the foot or ankle. You may get calluses or corns where a bent toe presses against another toe or your shoe or where the toe's tip touches the ground. In more severe cases, these toe problems may affect your balance and make it hard to walk. Your doctor will ask questions about your symptoms and past health and do a physical exam. Your doctor will want to know: When the problems started, what activities or shoes make them worse, and if other parts of the foot are painful. What kind of shoes you wear and how much time you spend standing or walking every day. Any medical conditions you have that could be related, such as arthritis, diabetes, or poor circulation. During the physical exam, your doctor will look at your foot to see if the toe joint is fixed or flexible. If you are thinking about having surgery to correct your problem, you may need: An X-ray to help the doctor decide what type of surgery would be most helpful. Blood flow testing, which may include Doppler ultrasound, if your foot seems to have poor blood flow. Nerve testing if your doctor thinks you have nerve problems in your foot. If this is the case, you may need to see a neurologist, a doctor who specializes in brain, spine, and nerve problems. You can probably treat your toe joint problem at home. If you start right away, you may be able to avoid surgery. Sandals or athletic shoes that don't rub on your toe may be a good option. Use products that cushion the toe or hold the foot in a more comfortable position, such as moleskin, toe tubes, arch supports, or other shoe inserts (orthotics). These are better for treating a flexible toe, but they can also provide some relief for a fixed toe. Care for any calluses or corns on your feet. Take an over-the-counter pain medicine, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen. If your toe joint is flexible, you can also try: Taping a hammer toe. Wrap tape under the big toe (or the toe next to the hammer toe), then over the hammer toe, and then under the next toe. These hold toes in a normal position, much like taping does. Your doctor or physical therapist may be able to suggest more exercises.Gently pull on your toes to stretch the bent joints. Work on one joint at a time. Put a towel flat under your feet and use your toes to crumple it.Do marble pickups . Use your toes to pick up marbles and drop them in a cup. Gently pull on your toes to stretch the bent joints. For example, if a joint bends up, gently stretch it down. Put a towel flat under your feet and use your toes to crumple it. Use your toes to pick up marbles and drop them in a cup. Call your doctor if your pain doesn't go away or it gets worse after 2 to 3 weeks of home treatment, or if you get a sore on your affected toe. Sores can get infected and lead to cellulitis or osteomyelitis, especially if you have diabetes or peripheral arterial disease. You may need surgery if other treatments don't control your pain, if your toe limits activity, or if you can't move the toe joint. For fixed toe problems, doctors often do surgery on the bones. Doctors can often treat flexible toe problems by moving tendons to release tension on the joint and let the toe straighten. In some cases, the surgery for a flexible toe problem will still include work on the bones. Your options may include one or more of the following: Removing part of the toe bone. Getting a toe implant to replace a bent joint or straighten a toe. Talk to your doctor about the types of surgery and how much they might help you. When thinking about surgery, keep in mind that: Surgery can reduce the pain from a deformed toe. Your toe problem may come back after surgery. This is more likely if you keep wearing the types of shoes that cause toe problems."], [701, "Should I have surgery for Dupuytren's di...", "In Dupuytren's (say \"duh-pwee-TRAHNZ\") disease, tissue under the skin in the palm of your hand, called the palmar fascia, gets thicker and shorter. This can cause your fingers to bend in toward your palm. It most often affects the ring and small fingers, usually of both hands. The disease may only involve the palm and never affect your fingers. If it gets worse, it may be hard to use your hands. What causes it isn't known, but your risk of having Dupuytren's is increased if you: Have relatives who have the disease. The disease has three general phases: In the early phase, you may see or feel a small lump in the palm of your hand, usually near where your ring finger and small finger meet. In the active phase, you may have dimpling on the skin of your palm. In the advanced phase, a fibrous cord may form in the fascia that pulls your fingers toward your palm. Over time, you won't be able to straighten your fingers or flatten your hand on a table. It may be hard or impossible to do things like put on gloves, wash your hands, or pick up things. The disease usually gets worse slowly. A physical exam and medical history will usually give enough information for a doctor to decide if you have Dupuytren's disease. Your doctor will: Look for skin changes on your palm and feel for any knots or a cord. Ask questions about your family, your symptoms, any other medical conditions, and your history of tobacco and alcohol use. The goal of treatment is to keep your hand working as well as it can. This may help reduce the contracture and improve your range of motion. A needle is used to make small holes in the tight cords in the palm. Surgery to remove or separate the affected tissue in the palm. A skin graft may be done to cover open areas in the palm. After surgery, you will need to follow a program of hand exercises and massage to help you move your fingers again. Your hand may work better after surgery, but you may not get back the full use of your hand. If your symptoms are mild, you can try gentle stretching exercises and massage. And they may help keep your hand flexible. For example, you can use utensils and tools that have larger hand grips."], [702, "Should I have surgery for carpal tunnel ...", "Surgery is considered only when: Symptoms haven't improved after several weeks to months of nonsurgical treatment. This assumes that you are having ongoing symptoms but no sign of nerve damage. Severe symptoms restrict normal daily activities, such as when:There is a persistent loss of feeling or coordination in the fingers or hand.There is decreased strength in the thumb.Sleep is severely disturbed by pain. There is a persistent loss of feeling or coordination in the fingers or hand. There is damage to the median nerve (shown by nerve test results and loss of hand, thumb, or finger function) or a risk of damage to the nerve. The most common surgery for relieving carpal tunnel symptoms involves cutting the transverse carpal ligament to relieve pressure on the median nerve in the wrist. Two approaches for this surgery are: Open carpal tunnel release surgery. The scars heal more quickly, are smaller, and tend to be less painful at 3 months after surgery. But there may be a slightly higher chance of needing another surgery later. This requires a smaller incision than standard open carpal tunnel release surgery. But there are few studies comparing it to the open carpal tunnel or endoscopic procedures at this time. Surgery is more likely to be successful if the results from nerve testing point to carpal tunnel syndrome. Your decision about whether to use open or endoscopic surgery depends on your doctor's experience with the procedures. Endoscopic carpal tunnel surgery uses very technical equipment and is most successful when the doctor has done the procedure many times. After surgery, it is important to avoid any activities that may have caused carpal tunnel syndrome."], [703, "Should I have surgery for bunions?", "Bunion surgery generally involves making an incision in the top or side of the big toe joint area and removing or realigning soft tissue and bone. The goals of surgery for bunions are to: Relieve pain and restore normal alignment to the toe joint. You may have to consider surgery if your bunion results in persistent, severe pain that limits your daily activities or if you have a severe foot deformity. Have other health problems that make surgery dangerous. If you have diabetes, neuromuscular disorders, or circulatory problems that limit blood flow to your feet, discuss the risks of surgery with your doctor. Have unrealistic expectations about the results of surgery (such as being able to wear any kind of shoe). Joint replacement surgery is not often done to repair a bunion. Some issues to consider when deciding about bunion surgery: The type of surgery used depends not only on how severe the bunion is but also on your surgeon's experience. Look for a surgeon who does many different types of bunion surgery on a regular basis. Bunions may return after surgery, especially if you continue to wear narrow or high-heeled shoes. For example, although surgery may improve your foot's appearance, those who make appearance their primary reason for surgery are generally disappointed in the results. Surgery may reduce the flexibility of the big toe joint, which may be a concern if you are active and need a full range of motion in the big toe."], [704, "Should I have surgery for an anterior cr...", "Most surgery for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries involves replacing the ACL with tissue called a graft. Repair surgery typically is used only in the case of an avulsion fracture (a separation of the ligament and a piece of the bone from the rest of the bone). In this case, the bone fragment connected to the ACL is reattached to the bone. Most ACL surgery is done by making small incisions in the knee and inserting surgical tools through these incisions (arthroscopic surgery). The goals of surgical treatment for ACL injuries are to: Restore normal or almost normal stability in the knee. Most people who have ACL surgery have favorable results, with reduced pain, good knee function and stability, and a return to normal levels of activity. Athletes and those who take part in sports typically can return to their sports within months. Before ACL surgery, strength and motion exercises are often done to help get the knee ready for surgery and for rehab after surgery. Surgery is followed by a short period of home exercises, increased activity, and the use of crutches for walking. Surgery for ACL injuries in children and teens involves special concerns, because children's bones are still growing. Depending on how bad your injury is, surgery with rehab may offer the best chance of making your knee stable again. It also may help you return to an active lifestyle without further pain, injury, or loss of strength and movement in your knee. If your injured knee gives out now and then (chronic ACL deficiency) and you continue to do activities that require a stable knee, you may injure your knee again. If you don't complete a rehab program, even with surgery you may not regain full stability and function in your knee."], [705, "Should I have surgery for a ruptured Ach...", "If you have a ruptured Achilles tendon , instead of having surgery you may use a cast, splint, brace, walking boot, or other device that will keep your lower leg from moving. When immobilized over a period of months, the Achilles tendon can slowly reattach and heal. When deciding on treatment for your tendon rupture, think about how active you are and how much leg strength you need at home or at work. Think about the following facts when you decide whether surgery or immobilization is best for you. After immobilization, an Achilles tendon may be more likely to rupture again than it would be after surgery. But if you are not physically active in sports, at home, or at work, then your risk of rerupturing the tendon is low. In these cases, immobilization may be enough treatment for your needs. After immobilization, your leg may be more likely to be weaker than after surgery."], [706, "Should I have surgery for a herniated di...", "A herniated disk can press on the nerves in your spine and cause pain, weakness, and numbness in your neck, back, arms, and legs. Most of the time, though, the problems from your herniated disk should start to improve on their own within a few weeks. In the meantime, try one or more of these treatments to help you feel better. Rest can relieve swelling and give your back time to heal. While your back hurts, avoid exercise and other activities where you have to bend or lift. Bed rest is fine for a short period of time, but don't stay off your feet for longer than 1 or 2 days. You need to keep moving so your joints and muscles don't stiffen up. You can also use ice and heat to help relieve your pain. You can alternate hot and cold, or use whichever feels best. These medicines can help relieve your pain and bring down swelling. Just don't use these for more than 10 days without talking to your doctor. When used in large amounts or for a long time, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can increase your risk for heart problems or bleeding. Narcotics such as codeine or oxycodone-acetaminophen (Percocet) are also short-term options that your doctor may prescribe if over-the-counter meds don't work. Your doctor might also prescribe muscle relaxants to ease muscle spasms in your back. And nerve pain medicines, such as amitriptyline (Elavil, Vanatrip), duloxetine (Cymbalta), gabapentin (Neurontin), pregabalin (Lyrica), and tramadol (Ultram) are options to ease nerve-damage pain. Some exercises can help improve the symptoms of a herniated disc. A physical therapist can teach you which ones strengthen the muscles that support your back. Physical therapy programs also include: Stretching exercises to keep your muscles flexible Aerobic exercises -- such as walking or riding a stationary bicycle Massage Ice and heat Ultrasound therapy Electrical muscle stimulation If rest, pain relievers, and physical therapy don't help with your pain, your doctor can inject a steroid medicine into the space around your spinal nerve. The steroid can help bring down the swelling, help you move more easily, and ease pain from a herniated disk. Your doctor will use an X-ray or CT scan to find the right spot to inject the medicine. You might need more than one steroid shot to relieve your pain. Most people with a herniated disk don't need surgery. Talk to your doctor about surgery if: You're not getting relief from pain relievers, injections, and physical therapy. During this procedure, your surgeon removes your damaged disk to relieve pressure on your nerves. He can perform the surgery in a couple of ways: Your surgeons performs open diskectomy is via a cut in your back or neck. Your surgeon inserts a thin tube with a camera on one end to see and remove the damaged disk. Sometimes your surgeon will also need to remove a small piece of bone called the lamina from the vertebra. The lamina forms a protective cover over your spinal cord. It also can relieve pressure on your nerves and eliminate leg pain and sciatica. After a diskectomy or laminotomy, your surgeon may fuse together the two vertebrae on either side of the disk to stabilize your spine. But if your doctor thinks this is an option, he will replace your damaged disk with one made of plastic or metal. The new disk will help keep your spine stable and let you move more easily. If you have to stand for a long period of time, rest one foot on a stool or box to take pressure off your back."], [707, "Should I have spinal manipulative therap...", "Sometimes blood and urine tests are performed to make sure that the back pain is not caused by an infection or other more widespread medical problem. If your doctor suspects a serious cause behind the back pain, X-rays may be ordered. To determine possible nerve or muscle damage, an electromyogram (EMG) can be useful. Back pain may be incorrectly attributed to non-specific and unrelated abnormalities on the images. Ordinary and expected wear and tear in the spine and discs may be mistaken as the cause of a person's back pain. Because most back pain is related to the muscles of the back, the specific cause of most back pain often cannot be determined by imaging studies. Rest: The basic treatment for relieving acute back pain from strain or minor injury is a limited period of rest for 24 to 72 hours. An ice pack can be helpful, as can aspirin or another nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) to reduce pain and inflammation. Long-term bed rest is not only no longer considered necessary for most cases of back pain, it is actually potentially harmful, making recovery slower and potentially causing new problems. Physical therapy treatments may employ massage, ultrasound, whirlpool baths, controlled application of heat, and individually tailored exercise programs to help you regain full use of the back. You can help prevent further back injury by learning - and doing - gentle stretching exercises and proper lifting techniques, and maintaining good posture.Medication: If back pain keeps you from normal daily activities, your doctor can help by recommending or prescribing pain medications. For severe pain, your doctor may prescribe prescription strength anti-inflammatories/pain medicines or may prefer to prescribe a short-term combination of opioid (narcotic) and acetaminophen medications such as Vicodin or Percocet. Opioids can be addictive and their use on a long term basis should be avoided unless a definite cause of back pain related to an injury or a disease can be established. If your primary doctor isn't able to help you control the pain, he/she may refer you to a back specialist or a pain specialist. Sometimes these doctors will use injections of steroids or anesthetics to help control the pain or for diagnosis. However, they can be important in helping diagnose structural causes in pain and assisting the physical rehabilitation when other methods have failed. After appropriate training, patients can use a TENS on their own to help reduce pain while they recover from strained or moderately injured backs. Surgery for nonspecific back pain is a last resort as spinal problems are unlikely to be the cause of chronic non-specific back pain in the absence of loss of movement and sensation or other findings such as loss of muscle bulk and reflexes. In cases where the pain spreads into the extremities and imaging studies reveal compression or damage to nerve tissue in the spine, surgery remains a consideration if loss of function as well as pain continues after a trial of conservative treatment with medications and activity modification including a home exercise program and physical therapy. Rhizotomy: In cases of persistent pain from extreme nerve damage, rhizotomy - surgically severing a nerve - may be necessary to stop transmission of pain to the brain. Spinal manipulation: The U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality recognizes spinal manipulation by chiropractors and osteopaths as effective for acute low-back pain. Spinal manipulation can be considered a form of conservative care for the treatment of acute and chronic back pain as it is not invasive and does not employ prescription medications. Because osteopaths are fully licensed doctors, their osteopathic treatment is likely to combine drug therapy with spinal manipulation, followed by physical therapy and exercise. Acupuncture: Both the American Pain Society and the American College of Physicians released guidelines stating that acupuncture may help patients with chronic low-back pain when other treatments have failed. However, there is not enough evidence yet to recommend it for acute back pain.CBT: If you consult a psychotherapist for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), your treatment may include stress management, behavioral adaptation, education, and relaxation techniques. CBT can lessen the intensity of back pain, change perceptions about levels of pain and disability, and even lift depression. The NIH considers CBT useful for relieving low back pain, citing studies that show CBT to be superior to routine care and placebo. Other comprehensive behavioral programs have shown similar success, with participants able to lessen the amount of medication they needed while improving their outlook and pain-related behavior.Biofeedback: If lower back pain is related to muscle tension or spasm, biofeedback can be effective for lessening pain intensity, decreasing drug use, and improving quality of life. Biofeedback may help you train your muscles to respond better to stress or movement.Exercise methods: The Alexander Technique, Pilates, and the Feldendkrais Method are all specialized forms of body work that help you learn to move in a more coordinated, flexible, and graceful manner. Some of the postures of yoga may help diminish low back pain, improve flexibility, strength, and sense of balance. Yoga is also good for stress reduction and can help with the psychological aspects of pain. More research is needed to see how these exercise techniques affect back pain.Aquatic therapy: Aquatic therapy and exercise can also improve flexibility and decrease pain for some people with chronic low back problems. It is especially beneficial for those patients who cannot tolerate land-based physical therapy.This is because the unique properties of water often make it a safe environment for exercising a sore back, providing gentle resistance, comfort, and relaxation. Fear of pain associated with movement is a major limiting factor for rehabilitation and exercises therapy."], [708, "Should I have rotator cuff surgery?", "Surgery may be considered if: Your rotator cuff injury is very severe. You have shoulder weakness caused by a complete tear, especially when the rotator cuff is otherwise healthy. Surgery typically is used to repair a torn rotator cuff in a healthy young person, because good results are more likely if there is little or no evidence of other problems. People who have advanced rotator cuff disorders and tendons that are tough, stringy (fibrous), and stiff usually respond less well to surgery. Surgery may successfully repair the tear, but it can't repair all the damage caused by age or degeneration. If surgery isn't done right away, repair of a large tear may not be as successful. Shoulder surgery for rotator cuff disorders usually involves one or more of the following: Debridement Rotator cuff repair Subacromial smoothing These procedures may be done arthroscopically, by traditional open surgery, or by a combination of the two approaches. Sometimes a rotator cuff tear is so severe that it can't be fixed in the usual ways. If this happens in a younger person, the doctor may suggest moving another tendon to substitute for the torn tendon. In an older person, the doctor may suggest a special shoulder replacement. The success of surgery for rotator cuff tears depends on many things, such as: The amount of other damage present."], [709, "Should I have regularly scheduled or on-...", "The plasma is processed to separate the clotting factors from the other parts of the plasma.

Most melanomas start as a new skin growth on unmarked skin. The growth may change color, shape, or size. These types of changes are an early sign that the growth is melanoma. But melanoma can also develop in an existing mole or other mark on the skin. It most often occurs on the upper back in men and women and on the legs in women. Less often, it can grow in other places, such as on the soles, palms, nail beds, or mucous membranes that line body cavities such as the mouth, the rectum, and the vagina. On older people, the face is the most common place for melanoma to grow. And in older men, the most common sites are the neck, scalp, and ears.1 The most important warning sign for melanoma is any change in size, shape, or color of a mole or other skin growth, such as a birthmark. One half of the mole or skin growth doesn't match the other half. The mole or skin growth is larger than the size of a pencil eraser. There is a change in the size, shape, symptoms (such as itching or tenderness), surface (especially bleeding), or color of a mole. Signs of melanoma in an existing mole include changes in: Elevation, such as thickening or raising of a previously flat mole. Surrounding skin, such as redness, swelling, or small new patches of color around a larger lesion (satellite pigmentations). Many other skin conditions (such as seborrheic keratosis, warts, and basal cell cancer) have features similar to those of melanoma. They include swollen lymph nodes, especially in the armpit or groin, and a colorless lump or thickening under the skin."], [711, "Skin & Beauty Skin Care Basics", "For good skin care, start developing healthy habits that guard your valued possession from outer (and inner) forces. Wash your face twice daily -- once in the morning and once at night before going to bed. After you cleanse your skin, follow with a toner and moisturizer. Buy a moisturizer that is best suited for your skin type (dry, normal, or oily). Over time, exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun causes many changes in the skin, including wrinkles, discoloration, freckles or age spots, benign (non-cancerous) growths such as seborrheic keratoses and pre-cancerous or cancerous growths such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. In fact, most skin cancers are related to sun exposure. Limit your time in the sun, especially between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., and always wear a broad spectrum sunscreen with the physical blocker zinc oxide and a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or greater. Cover exposed areas with protective clothing, such as a long-sleeve shirt, pants, and a wide-brimmed hat. It can be dry or oily; it can develop rashes and acne, among many other issues. Address the problem with a professional skin expert, either a skin aesthetician at your local salon or a dermatologist for more severe skin problems.

Talk with your doctor about the benefits and side effects of each type. Doctors usually recommend three main types of treatment for prostate cancer in its early stages: Watchful waiting or active surveillance Surgery Radiation therapy Prostate cancer often grows very slowly. For some men, the treatments themselves have risks that are greater than the benefit of getting rid of the cancer.Watchful waiting may be an option in this case. The doctor may do tests from time to time to see if the cancer is growing. Your doctor will do tests, including PSA blood tests and rectal exams, usually about every 3-6 months to check on the cancer. You might also have a biopsy, when your doctor takes a small piece of tissue from your prostate and checks it under a microscope. Your doctor will keep a close eye on your health to be sure the disease doesn't cause any problems for you. Because the cancer hasn't spread beyond your prostate in stage I or II, surgery to remove the gland can sometimes cure the disease. The surgeon will remove the whole organ, plus some of the tissue around it. This technique is called laparoscopy, and the cuts are smaller than in the other operations. A surgeon can also use robotic arms to control the surgical tools and make more precise cuts, called robotic surgery. Your surgeon will try not to damage nerves and other structures around your prostate during surgery, but sometimes, it's not possible. If your cancer has spread to those nerves, doctors will have to remove them. If that happens, you might have side effects afterward, including: A leaky bladder or trouble controlling your urine Trouble getting or keeping an erection or having orgasms Loss of your ability to get a woman pregnant Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays to kill cancer cells. You can get it in one of two ways: External beam radiation therapy focuses X-rays on your prostate from a machine outside your body. The doctor will direct the radiation right to the gland and adjust the dose to target the cancer. Proton therapy better targets prostate tissue in hopes of causing less damage to other parts, but it's not available at many medical centers. Brachytherapy uses small pellets, about the size of rice grains, which slowly give off low levels of radiation inside your prostate for a few weeks or months. Doctors will give you medicine to put you to sleep or make your body numb, then put the pellets in through thin needles. Doctors can also give the radiation through small tubes that they place in your prostate for a few minutes at a time. Your doctor will do everything possible to keep from harming the area around your prostate, but some men have side effects from radiation, such as: Diarrhea, blood in their stool, and other bowel problems Trouble controlling urination, or a leaky bladder Erection problems Feeling tired Radiation and surgery are the main treatments for early-stage prostate cancer. Side effects include blood in your urine, bladder and bowel problems, and trouble getting an erection. If your doctor thinks your disease could come back after surgery, you might get therapy to stop your body from making those substances. Side effects can include a lower sex drive, erection problems, and bone thinning."], [713, "Should I have my son circumcised?", "It may surprise many parents that circumcision of a newborn son is a family decision, not a medical one. Approximately two-thirds of boys in the United States are circumcised, some because of the family's religious beliefs or cultural norms. There are some potential medical benefits of circumcision in terms of a slightly lower risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in little boys, certain sexually transmitted infections in men, and penile cancer. However, all of these problems are uncommon (for example, only about 1% of all boys will have a UTI), so lowering the risk of an uncommon problem isn't a huge benefit. Additionally, an uncircumcised penis is easy to care for and keep clean, so improved hygiene is not a reason for routine circumcisions, either. Ask yourself the following questions: What are your feelings about circumcision in general? Are there cultural or religious reasons to have your child circumcised (or not) that are important to you and your family? It should be performed in the first few days of your son's life by a medical doctor, under local anesthesia. If it is performed a few weeks after birth, the circumcision is generally done by a urologist who will use general anesthesia. Make sure the circumcision is performed by an experienced professional. Some religious groups have the circumcision done later as part of a meaningful ceremony, either by a specially trained non-physician or a physician. Ask the following questions before the procedure: How and when is circumcision done?What are the potential risks of circumcision and how often do they occur?What is entailed in caring for the recently circumcised penis? What are the potential risks of circumcision and how often do they occur? Dealing with your son's pain: Circumcision hurts. However, hospitals routinely use local anesthesia during circumcisions.

If a miscarriage is causing intense pain or bleeding or is taking longer than you are comfortable with, talk to your doctor about using medicine or surgery (such as a procedure called dilation and curettage, or D&amp;C) to clear the uterus. An obstetrician, a family medicine doctor, or a certified nurse-midwife can manage a miscarriage. If you have vaginal bleeding but tests suggest that your pregnancy is still progressing, your doctor may recommend: Resting. You will be advised to temporarily avoid sexual intercourse (pelvic rest) and heavy activity. You will be advised to avoid aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. Use only acetaminophen, such as Tylenol, for nonprescription pain relief. This is called an incomplete miscarriage (incomplete or missed spontaneous abortion). If your doctor determines that you have had an incomplete miscarriage, you will have one or more treatment options: Watchful waiting. This period of waiting, called expectant management, allows the miscarriage to end naturally while your doctor watches for and treats any complications. Using misoprostol causes the uterus to empty. Dilation and curettage or vacuum aspiration clears the uterus of tissue. If you are bleeding heavily, you will be tested for anemia and treated if needed. In very rare cases, removal of the uterus (hysterectomy) is needed for women who have severe, uncontrollable bleeding or a severe infection that is not cured with antibiotics. Your chances of having a successful pregnancy are good, even if you've had one or two miscarriages. If you have had three or more miscarriages (recurrent miscarriage), your doctor may suggest further testing to help find the cause."], [716, "Should I have laser surgery for nearsigh...", "Vision correction surgery, also called refractive and laser eye surgery, refers to any surgical procedure used to fix vision problems. Refractive and laser eye surgery allow many patients to see better than any other time in their lives. Most types of vision correction surgery reshape your cornea, the clear front part of your eye. That lets light travel through it and focus properly on the back of your eye, or retina. Other procedures replace your eye's natural lens. Types of surgery include: LASIK , or laser in-situ keratomileusis. She also makes a flap in the outer layer of the cornea so she can get to the tissue underneath. The doctor may also use a type computer imaging called wavefront technology to create a detailed image of your cornea that she can use as a guide. PRK, or photorefractive keratectomy, is used to correct mild to moderate nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. Like LASIK, a surgeon uses a laser to reshape your cornea. Your doctor may also use computer imaging of the cornea. LASEK, or laser epithelial keratomileusis, is a lot like PRK. She'll use an alcohol solution to loosen the tissue and a laser to reshape your cornea. After that, she'll use a soft contact lens to hold the flap in place while your eye heals. RLE stands for refractive lens exchange. Other names include PRELEX, clear lens exchange (CLE), clear lens extraction (CLE), and refractive lens replacement (RLR). It works well for people with thin corneas, dry eyes, or other minor cornea problems. A LASIK or LASIK-related procedure can be combined with RLE to correct astigmatism. Epi-LASEK: The doctor cuts a small flap in your cornea and uses an alcohol solution to help separate a thin layer of tissue from your cornea. Epi-LASIK: The doctor separates a thin layer of tissue from your cornea and reshapes it with a laser. PRELEX: Short for presbyopic lens exchange, this procedure is used for presbyopia, or loss of flexibility in your eye. Intacs, also known as intracorneal ring segments, or ICR. ICR was used to treat nearsightedness, but that has been replaced by laser-based procedures. Now it's used to fix keratoconus, an irregular-shaped cornea that causes your cornea to thin and results in vision loss. The doctor makes a small incision at the edge of your cornea and either attaches the implant lens to your iris or inserts it behind your pupil. Unlike RLE, your natural lens stays in place. It isn't laser eye surgery, but a surgical procedure used to correct astigmatism. When you have astigmatism, your eye is shaped like a football instead of being round. This procedure can be done alone, or in combination with other laser eye surgeries like PRK, LASIK, or RK. RK, or radial keratotomy, was once a common way to correct nearsightedness. However, with the development of more effective laser eye surgeries, such as LASIK and PRK, it's rarely used today. Their good results are well-documented, but like any surgery, there can be side effects. You won't know how well the surgery worked until your eye has healed properly. If your vision isn't great, a second laser surgery, called laser enhancement, can help. This is a part of the natural healing process after some refractive or laser eye surgeries. It usually has no effect on your vision after and can only be seen through an eye exam. Also, a medication called mitomycin during PRK surgery can prevent it. You may need a second surgery to improve your vision. This happens in dim light and can make it hard to drive or see in dark places. Your doctor can use laser optical zones or wavefront technology, which creates a 3-D version of your eye so your surgery is more precise, to make it less likely. It may need to be repositioned during the first few days after surgery or after a severe direct injury to your eye."], [717, "Should I have knee replacement surgery?", "Knee osteoarthritis (OA) can affect your every move: walking, climbing stairs, even sitting or lying down. Corticosteroid injections, also called cortisone shots, fight inflammation and can offer fast pain relief that may last up to several months. They may take up to a couple of months to have their full effect but can last up to 6 months or more. A physical therapist can design the program for you and see if you need supportive braces, splints, or canes. If you need to lose weight, diet and exercise can help you shed some pounds and take some of the pressure off your knees. Every pound you gain puts an extra 3 pounds of pressure on your knees. If you eventually need knee replacement surgery, your chances of success are much greater if you first lose extra weight. Another supplement, called SAMe, has been shown to work as well as nonprescription pain relievers and may have fewer side effects. Before you start taking any supplements, even if they're natural, tell your doctor so he can check for any side effects. These treatment options may provide enough relief to keep you moving comfortably. If they don't, they become less effective over time, or you can't tolerate them, your doctor may suggest considering surgery. The two types of surgery most often recommended for knee OA are arthroscopic surgery and knee replacement surgery. In this type of surgery, the surgeon inserts a thin tube with a tiny camera on the end through a small opening in your skin to view the inside of your knee. Your knee can be cleaned or flushed to remove loose bone or cartilage pieces that may be causing pain. Most people can get back to their usual activities a few days later. Arthroscopic surgery may provide short-term relief from pain and possibly delay more complex surgery. If you have tried all other osteoarthritis treatment options and still have knee pain, your doctor may suggest knee replacement. It can help reduce your pain and improve your ability to move. Knee replacement surgery involves removing all or part of the knee joint and replacing the damaged parts with an artificial joint. It may take months to recover fully, but the relief can last many years or even a lifetime. It may be time to have knee replacement surgery if you have: Severe knee pain that limits your everyday activities Moderate or severe knee pain while resting, day or night Long-lasting knee inflammation and swelling that doesn't get better with rest or medications A bowing in or out of your leg Knee stiffness No pain relief from NSAIDs or can't tolerate them"], [718, "Should I have infertility treatment?", "Men will get a physical exam and often a sperm analysis, which tests the health of his sperm.

You are in your mid-30s or older, have not used birth control for 6 months, and have not been able to become pregnant. You are in your 20s or early 30s, have not used birth control for a year or more, and have not been able to become pregnant. You and your partner will need to keep track of the frequency of sexual intercourse and talk about this with your doctor. Sometimes you may not find out what causes infertility even after many tests. So it is important to know how many tests you want to try. Other tests that are medical procedures, such as hysteroscopy or laparoscopy, have a higher chance of problems after the test. Your internist or family medicine physician may do some of the first tests. Infertility tests may find what is causing the problem and you can sometimes be treated during the tests. For example, a blocked fallopian tube may be opened during a hysterosalpingogram. But you may still be able to become pregnant using assisted reproductive technology, which can treat male or female problems.

The procedure should relieve a painful hip joint, making walking easier. Hip replacement surgery can be performed traditionally or by using what is considered a minimally-invasive technique. During standard hip replacement surgery, you are given general anesthesia to relax your muscles and put you into a temporary deep sleep. The doctor will then make a cut along the side of the hip and move the muscles connected to the top of the thighbone to expose the hip joint. Next, the ball portion of the joint is removed by cutting the thighbone with a saw. Then an artificial joint is attached to the thighbone using either cement or a special material that allows the remaining bone to attach to the new joint. The doctor then prepares the surface of the hipbone -- removing any damaged cartilage -- and attaches the replacement socket part to the hipbone. The new ball part of the thighbone is then inserted into the socket part of the hip. While most hip replacement surgeries today are performed using the standard technique (one 8 to 10 inch cut along the side of the hip), in recent years, some doctors have been using a minimally-invasive technique. In the minimally-invasive approach, doctors make one to two cuts from 2 to 5 inches long. The same procedure is performed through these small cuts as with standard hip replacement surgery. The small cuts are thought to lessen blood loss, ease pain following surgery, shorten hospital stays, reduce scar appearance, and speed healing. Research has shown the outcomes with minimally-invasive approach may be worse than with standard hip replacement surgery if done by a doctor who is not very experienced with this technique. Since there can be some blood loss during hip replacement surgery, you may need a blood transfusion, so you may want to consider donating your own blood before the procedure. You will likely stay in the hospital for four to six days and may have to stay in bed with a wedge-shaped cushion between your legs to keep the new hip joint in place. Physical therapy usually begins the day after surgery and within days you can walk with a walker, crutches, or a cane. For anywhere from six to 12 months after hip replacement surgery, pivoting or twisting on the involved leg should be avoided. Your physical therapist will provide you with techniques and adaptive equipment that will help you follow any of the above guidelines and precautions while performing daily activities. Remember, by not following your therapist's recommendations you could dislocate your newly replaced hip joint and may require another surgery. There are a few simple measures that you can take to make life easier when you return home after hip replacement surgery, including: Keep stair climbing to a minimum. Hip replacements surgery has been performed for years and surgical techniques are being improved all the time. Since you will not be able to move around much at first, blood clots are a particular concern. Other less common concerns that you and your doctor must watch out for are: Your legs may not be of equal length after the surgery. Nerves in the hip area may be injured from swelling or pressure and can cause some numbness. The replacement parts may become loose, break, or become infected. When hip replacement surgeries were first performed in the early 1970s, it was thought that the average artificial joint would last approximately 10 years. We now know that about 85% of the hip joint implants will last 20 years. If the joint does become damaged, surgery to repair it can be successful but is more complicated than the original procedure."], [721, "Should I have disease-modifying therapy ...", "There is no cure for multiple sclerosis (MS). So far, the only treatments proved to affect the course of the disease are disease-modifying medicines, such as interferon beta. The placebo effect means that you feel better after getting treatment, even though the treatment may not have been proved to work. A summary of evidence on complementary and alternative therapies suggests that some treatments may help relieve symptoms. For example:1 Some forms of natural or man-made substances related to marijuana may help with muscle stiffness (spasticity) and pain. Ginkgo biloba or magnetic therapy may help relieve fatigue for some people. The summary showed that several other complementary and alternative treatments are not likely to help. For example:1 Natural or man-made substances related to marijuana are unlikely to help relieve tremor. Ginkgo biloba does not help people who have MS think more clearly. The Cari Loder regimen (lofepramine plus phenylalanine with vitamin B12) is not likely to help improve general quality of life or to relieve depression or disability. Some people think that certain things may increase the risk of having an attack of MS, including: Dietary deficiencies. Many people who have MS also experiment with their diets, in part because there are many claims about the effectiveness of certain diets and nutritional supplements in the treatment of MS. The Swank Diet recommends low intake of saturated fat [maximum of 3 tsp (15 mL) a day] and high consumption of polyunsaturated fat [up to 10 tsp (49 mL) a day for very active people]. Evening primrose oil, the most widely used herbal supplement in MS, has not been shown to provide any significant benefit in controlling the disease. Melatonin is a hormone that is produced by a small gland (pineal gland) in the brain. One theory suggests that MS may be associated with dysfunction of the pineal gland and lower-than-normal levels of melatonin, which may disrupt the immune system. There is no evidence to show that any of these diets or supplements have any benefit in the treatment of MS. A healthful, balanced diet will provide all the nutrients you need in most cases. Good nutrition may also help you feel better and benefit your overall health. Discuss your treatment options with your doctor before trying any type of alternative treatment for MS.

Knee pain has a wide variety of specific causes and treatments. The knee joint's main function is to bend, straighten, and bear the weight of the body, along with the ankles and hips. The knee, more than just a simple hinged joint, however, also twists and rotates. In order to perform all of these actions and to support the entire body while doing so, the knee relies on a number of structures including bones, ligaments, tendons, and cartilage. One of the bones in the lower leg (or calf area), the tibia, provides the bottom weight-bearing portion of the joint. The remaining bone in the calf, the fibula, is not involved in the weight-bearing portion of the knee joint but provides ligament attachments for stability. Ligaments Ligaments are dense fibrous bands that connect bones to each other. The knee includes four important ligaments, all of which connect the femur to the tibia: The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) provide front and back (anterior and posterior) and rotational stability to the knee. The medial collateral ligament (MCL) and lateral collateral ligament (LCL) located along the inner (medial) and outer (lateral) sides of the knee provide medial and lateral stability to the knee. Instead of connecting bones to other bones as ligaments do, tendons connect muscles to bones. The two important tendons in the knee are (1) the quadriceps tendon connecting the quadriceps muscle, which lies on the front of the thigh, to the patella and (2) the patellar tendon connecting the patella to the tibia (technically, this is a ligament because it connects two bones). The quadriceps and patellar tendons are sometimes called the extensor mechanism, and together with the quadriceps muscle they facilitate leg extension (straightening). Cartilage Cartilaginous structures called menisci (singular form is \"meniscus\") line the top of the tibia and lie between the tibia and the 2 knuckles at the bottom of the femur (called the femoral condyles). Bursae Bursae (one is a bursa) are fluid-filled sacs that help to cushion the knee. In treating many types of knee pain, a common goal is to break the inflammatory cycle. However, if the injury and subsequent inflammation is not resolved, inflammation can become a chronic issue, leading to further inflammation and additional injury. This cycle of inflammation leads to continued or progressive knee pain. Some common home care techniques for knee pain that control inflammation and help to break the inflammatory cycle are protection, rest, ice, compression, and elevation. A pad over the kneecap, for example, helps to control the symptoms of some knee injuries (an example is a form of bursitis sometimes called housemaid's knee) by preventing further repetitive injury to the prepatellar bursae. Use an ice bag or a bag of frozen vegetables placed on the knee. COMPRESS the knee with a knee brace or wrap. Prop your leg up when you are sitting, or use a recliner, which naturally elevates the legs. Elevation works best when the knee -- or any other injured body part -- is higher than the level of the heart. Over-the-counter pain medicine: Commonly used pain relievers, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like naproxen (Aleve or Naprosyn) and ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin), also play a role in the treatment of knee pain. These drugs directly control pain and, at higher doses, act as anti-inflammatory agents, helping to break the inflammatory cycle. You should not use NSAIDs if you have a problem with bleeding or stomach ulcers or some types of kidney disease. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) can also be used to control knee pain but does not have the anti-inflammatory properties of the NSAIDs. Still, this treatment is remarkably useful in many types of knee pain, such as osteoarthritis. When you are deciding whether to call the doctor about your knee pain, a good rule of thumb exists for most long-term knee injuries. If your symptoms have not gone away after trying a week of PRICE therapy and over-the-counter anti-inflammatory pain meds, you should set up an appointment with your doctor, physical therapist, or a sports medicine orthopaedic (bone and muscle) specialist to further evaluate the pain. If you cannot put weight on your knee, feel sick, or have a fever or if your knee is red and hot, you should consider going to the ER to be evaluated by a doctor because of the possibility of a fracture or infection. Many fractures may require immobilization in a specific position or surgery. Other signs and symptoms that demand emergency evaluation: Unbearable pain Pain that does not improve with rest Pain that wakes you Drainage Large wounds Puncture wounds Swelling, if you are on a blood thinner (warfarin or Coumadin) or have a bleeding disorder (such as hemophilia) History: Even in today's world of technology, doctors rely on a detailed history and physical exam more than any single test. Physical exam The doctor will likely have you disrobe to completely expose the knee. In addition, the doctor may perform a number of maneuvers to stress the ligaments, tendons, and menisci of the knee and evaluate the integrity of each of these. X-rays, CT scans, and other tests Depending on your particular history and exam, the doctor may suggest X-rays of the knee. X-rays show fractures (broken bones) and dislocations of bones in the knee as well as arthritis and abnormally large or small joint spaces. Rarely, the doctor may order a CT scan (a 3-dimensional X-ray) of the knee to precisely define a fracture or deformity. They both are also poor, however, at evaluating soft tissue structures of the knee, such as ligaments, tendons, and the menisci. MRI Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses large magnets to create a 3-dimensional image of the knee. Fluid removal The knee and all bursae of the knee are filled with fluid. If your symptoms suggest infection or crystalline arthritis, such as gout, your physician may remove fluid, with a needle, from the knee. The doctor may also elect to perform certain blood tests to evaluate for signs of infection or diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and diabetes. Arthroscopy The orthopedic surgeon may elect to perform arthroscopy if you have chronic knee pain. By doing so, the surgeon may be able to see small particles in the knee or to look more closely at damaged menisci or cartilage. The doctor may also be able to treat damage by shaving down torn cartilage or removing particles from the knee while looking at the inside of your knee on a video monitor. Pain from a deeper injury (called referred pain) can be passed along the nerve to be felt on the surface. Knee pain, therefore, can arise from the knee itself or be referred from conditions of the hip, ankle, or lower back. In general, knee pain is either immediate (acute) or long-term (chronic). Chronic knee pain is often from injuries or inflammation (such as arthritis) but can also be caused by infection. Sprained and Torn Cruciate Ligaments Description: An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is a common sports injury generally caused by a hard stop or a violent twisting of the knee. The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is stronger than the ACL and much less commonly torn. A PCL injury may happen with a serious blow, such as when the knee strikes the dashboard in a car accident; this is why a PCL injury is often associated with other ligament and bone injuries. Symptoms: If you tear your ACL, you may hear a pop. You will also notice your knee give way or become unstable and feel pain that is bad enough that you might feel like vomiting. This will, almost always, be followed by marked knee swelling over the next couple of hours because the ACL bleeds briskly when torn. A quadriceps tendon rupture typically occurs in recreational athletes older than 40 years (this is the injury former President Clinton suffered while jogging), and a patellar tendon rupture typically occurs in younger people who have had previous tendonitis or steroid injections to the knee. Symptoms: Rupture of either the quadriceps or patellar tendon causes pain (especially when trying to kick or extend the knee). The patella is also often out of place either upward (with patellar tendon rupture) or downward (with quadriceps tendon rupture). Symptoms: Meniscal injuries may cause the knee to lock in a particular position, or either click or grind through its range of motion. Swelling typically accompanies these symptoms, although the swelling may be much less severe than with an ACL injury. A locking knee or a knee that \"gives\" should be evaluated for arthroscopic repair. Knee Dislocation Description: Knee dislocation is a medical emergency. Nerve injuries, on the other hand, may leave the lower leg viable but without strength or sensation. Symptoms: Knee dislocations are severely painful and produce an obvious deformity of the knee. Treatment: If the knee dislocation has not been put back into place on its own, the doctor will immediately reduce the dislocation. Whether a dislocation reduces by itself or is put back into place in the hospital, it requires further evaluation and care. After reduction, people with these injuries are observed in the hospital where they usually do a number of tests to ensure that no arterial or nerve injury has occurred. Dislocated Kneecap (patella) Description: A common injury caused by direct trauma or forceful straightening of the leg, such as an injury that happens when serving in volleyball or tennis. Kneecap dislocation is more common in women, the obese, knock-kneed people, and in those with high-riding kneecaps. Symptoms: If you have this injury, you will notice the patella being out of place and may have difficulty flexing or extending your knee. Treatment: The doctor will move the patella back into place (reduce the dislocation). Even if the patella goes back into place by itself, it needs to be X-rayed for a fracture. After reducing the dislocation and ensuring the absence of a fracture, the doctors will treat these injuries by splinting the knee to allow the soft tissues around the patella to heal followed by strengthening exercises to keep the patella in line. Arthritis: Arthritis of the knee is an inflammatory disorder of the knee joint that is often painful. Knee Osteoarthritis Description: Osteoarthritis (OA) is caused by degeneration of cartilage in the knee. In its extreme form, the menisci (cartilage) will be completely eroded, and the femur will rub on the tibia, bone on bone. Symptoms: Osteoarthritis causes a chronically painful knee that is often more painful with activity. Treatment: Treatment is aimed at pain control with over-the-counter pain relievers. Hyaluronic acid, a lubricating gel, often injected into the knee over a course of 3-6 weeks, can provide substantial relief for one year or more. Severe OA can be treated with narcotic pain medicines or a knee joint replacement in which a synthetic joint replaces your knee joint. Additionally, physical therapy to manage OA pain and knee function can be beneficial. Rheumatoid Arthritis of the Knee Description: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a connective tissue disease of the whole body that affects many joints, often the knee. Symptoms: In addition to knee pain, rheumatoid arthritis may produce morning stiffness and pain in other joints. Treatment: Treatment includes pain medications, anti-inflammatory medications, and prescription drugs (such as Rheumatrex) that are aimed at slowing disease progression. Crystalline Arthritis (gout and pseudogout) Description: These severely painful forms of arthritis are caused by sharp crystals that form in the knee and other joints. These crystals can form as a result of defects in the absorption or metabolism of various natural substances such as uric acid (which produces gout) and calcium pyrophosphate (pseudogout). Treatment: Treatment is aimed at controlling inflammation with anti-inflammatory medications, and at aiding the metabolism of the various chemicals that may lead to crystal formation. Bursitis Description: As a result of trauma, infection, or crystalline deposits, the various bursae of the knee may become inflamed. Symptoms: Acute or chronic trauma causes a painful and often swollen knee from the inflammation of the bursae. More commonly occurring in the overweight and in women, but also affecting athletes and others, anserine bursitis often causes pain in the region of the bursa and is often worse with bending the knee or at night with sleep. Infection (or infectious arthritis) Description: Many organisms may infect the knee. Gonorrhea, a common sexually transmitted disease, can infect the knee, as can common organisms residing on normal skin. Symptoms: Infection of the knee causes painful knee swelling. In addition, people who develop such infection typically complain of fevers and chills. Treatment: New swelling and pain in the knee must be evaluated for infection by a doctor. Aspiration of the joint or surgical drainage may also be recommended. Patellofemoral Syndrome and Chondromalacia Patella Description: These two conditions represent a continuum of diseases caused by patellar mistracking. Symptoms: The conditions typically occur in young women, in athletes of both sexes, and in older people. As a result, the patellofemoral joint on either the inner or outer side may become inflamed, causing pain that is worse with activity or prolonged sitting. As the condition progresses, softening and roughening of the articular cartilage on the underside of the patella occurs, leading to chondromalacia patella. Treatment: Home care with PRICE therapy, NSAIDs, and exercises (such as straight leg raises) that balance the muscles around the patella work for most people. Physical therapy to assess factors that may contribute to the disease process guides management to include exercise, bracing or taping of the patella, commercial arch supports (for the arch of the foot), or orthotic supports that correct foot mechanics and may reduce abnormal forces on the knee. Jumper's Knee Description: Tendonitis (inflammation of the tendon) of the quadriceps tendon at the upper point of the patella, where it inserts, or tendonitis of the patellar tendon either at the lower point of the patella, or at the place where it inserts on the tibia (called the tibial tuberosity, the bump is about 2 inches below the knee on the front side). Jumper's knee is so named because it is typically seen in basketball players, volleyball players, and people doing other jumping sports. Symptoms: Jumper's knee causes localized pain that is worse with activity. It usually hurts more as you jump up than when you land, because jumping puts more stress on tendons of the knee. Treatment: Home therapy with the PRICE regimen, along with anti-inflammatory drugs, is the basis of treatment to manage the acute phase. Particularly important are rest, ice, and NSAID drugs, which will help stop the pain and break the cycle of inflammation. After controlling the pain, you should slowly start an exercise regimen to strengthen the quadriceps, hamstrings, hip, and calf muscles before resuming your sport of choice a few weeks down the line. Osgood- Schlatter Disease Description: Osgood-Schlatter disease occurs in adolescent athletes where repetitive extension of the knee causes inflammation and injury of the tibial tubercle (the bony protrusion at the top of the shin, just below the kneecap). Treatment: Osgood-Schlatter disease is a self-limited condition that usually resolves as the the tibial tubercle stops growing with the end of adolescence (at about age 17 in males and age 15 in females). In severe cases, splinting the knee for a few weeks may help reduce the pain and halt the inflammation cycle. Early on, the pain will typically come on 10 minutes to 15 minutes into a run and improve with rest. A physical therapist can evaluate mechanics and prescribe treatments, which may include stretching the iliotibial band. Many types of pain are difficult to prevent, but you can do some general things to reduce the likelihood of sustaining a knee injury. Stretching and strengthening, therefore, also help to prevent knee pain. Strengthening exercises, particularly of the quadriceps (straight leg raises and leg extensions are among the prescribed exercises), can help prevent knee injury and are essential to reducing arthritis and associated complications. Exercise Wisely If you have chronic knee pain, consider swimming or water exercises. If you don't have access to a pool or do not enjoy water activities, at least try to limit hard pounding and twisting activities such as basketball, tennis, or jogging. You may find that your aching knees will act up if you play basketball or tennis every day but will not if you limit your pounding sports to twice a week. When driving, knee protection may include wearing a seatbelt to avoid the knee-versus-dashboard injuries as well as injuries to other parts of your body."], [724, "Should I have an angiogram to test for c...", "An angiogram is an X-ray test that uses a special dye and camera (fluoroscopy) to take pictures of the blood flow in an artery (such as the aorta) or a vein (such as the vena cava). An angiogram can be used to look at the arteries or veins in the head, arms, legs, chest, back, or belly. Common angiograms can look at the arteries near the heart (coronary angiogram), lungs (pulmonary angiogram), brain (cerebral angiogram), head and neck (carotid angiogram), legs or arms (peripheral), and the aorta (aortogram). During an angiogram, a thin tube called a catheter is placed into a blood vessel in the groin (femoral artery or vein) or just above the elbow (brachial artery or vein). The angiogram pictures can be made into regular X-ray films or stored as digital pictures in a computer. An angiogram can find a bulge in a blood vessel (aneurysm). A magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) or computed tomography angiogram (CTA) may be an option instead of an angiogram. An angiogram is done to: Detect problems with blood vessels that affect blood flow. Examples of such problems include a tear in a blood vessel (which can cause blockage or internal bleeding), aneurysms (which are weaknesses in the blood vessel wall), and narrowed areas. Look for changes in the blood vessels of injured or damaged organs. Show the pattern of blood flow to a tumor. Show the condition, number, and location of renal arteries before a kidney transplant. Prepare for surgery on diseased blood vessels of the legs (peripheral arterial disease) in people who have severe leg pain when walking. In some cases, a method called interventional radiology may be used during an angiogram to treat diseases. For example, a catheter can be used to open a blocked blood vessel, deliver medicine to a tumor, or stop intestinal bleeding caused by diverticular hemorrhage. To stop intestinal bleeding, the catheter is moved into the small artery where the bleeding is occurring, and medicine that narrows the artery or causes the blood to clot is injected through the catheter. Before an angiogram, tell your doctor if you: Are or might be pregnant. Use formula (throw out your breast milk) for 1 to 2 days after the angiogram until the dye has passed from your body. Have ever had a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) from any substance, such as the venom from a bee sting or from eating shellfish. Have a history of kidney problems or diabetes, especially if you take metformin (such as Glucophage) to control your diabetes. The dye used during an angiogram can cause kidney damage in people who have poor kidney function. Do not eat or drink for 4 to 8 hours before the angiogram. You may be asked to not take aspirin, aspirin products, or blood thinners for several days before the test and for 1 day after the test. If you are an outpatient, you will stay in a recovery room for several hours before you go home. You may want to bring something to do or read to pass the time. Arrange to have someone take you home because you may get a sedative before the test. The test may take several hours, so you will empty your bladder just before it begins. Also before the angiogram you may have other blood tests, such as blood clotting (coagulation) studies, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine. Talk to your doctor about any concerns you have regarding the need for the test, its risks, how it will be done, or what the results will mean. To help you understand the importance of this test, fill out the medical test information form(What is a PDF document?). An angiogram can be done by different types of doctors, including a radiologist, cardiologist, or surgeon. You may need to take off all or most of your clothes. A device called a pulse oximeter, which measures oxygen levels in your blood, may be clipped to your finger or ear. Small pads or patches (electrodes) are placed on your arms, chest, or legs to record your heart rate and rhythm. Ask for a pad or blanket to make yourself comfortable. A strap, tape, or sandbags may be used to hold your body still. The place where the catheter will be inserted (in the groin or above the elbow) will be shaved and cleaned. Your doctor will use the fluoroscope to watch the movement of the catheter in the blood vessels. You may be asked to take a breath and hold it for several seconds. The catheter is taken out after the angiogram, and pressure is put on the needle site for 10 to 15 minutes to stop any bleeding. A small sandbag or clamp may be put on the site to hold pressure. If the catheter was put in a vessel in your arm, you should not have any blood taken from that arm or your blood pressure measured in that arm for several days. If the catheter was placed in the groin area, try to keep that leg straight for 8 hours. The place in your hands and feet where your heartbeat (peripheral pulse) can be felt may be marked with a pen. You may feel a brief sting or pinch from the numbing medicine. For some people, the feeling of heat is strong and for others it is very mild. You may have a headache, flushing of the face, or a salty or metallic taste in your mouth after the dye is used. Some people may feel sick to their stomachs or may vomit, but this is not common. After the test, you may have some tenderness and bruising at the site where the catheter was inserted. You can drink extra fluids to pass the dye from your body unless your doctor has told you not to. The chance of any major problem from an angiogram is very small, but some problems can occur. In most cases, the problems occur within 2 hours after the test when you are in the recovery room. If the problem occurs during the angiogram, the test may not be completed. The reaction can be mild (itching, rash) or severe (trouble breathing or sudden shock). There is a small chance that the catheter may damage a blood vessel or dislodge a piece of clotted blood or fat from the vessel wall. The clot or fat can block blood flow to the brain, arm, leg, or intestine (bowel). Also, a blood clot can form where the catheter was inserted. This may cause some blockage of the blood flow in the arm or leg. The iodine dye used for the test can cause water loss or direct damage to the kidneys. This is a special concern for people who have kidney problems, diabetes, or who are dehydrated. Special measures are used during the test to prevent problems for people who need an angiogram and have these conditions. There is always a small chance of damage to cells or tissue from being exposed to any radiation, even the low level used for this test. An angiogram is an X-ray test that uses a special dye and camera (fluoroscopy) to take pictures of the blood flow in an artery (such as the aorta) or a vein (such as the vena cava). Your doctor may tell you some results right after the test. Reasons you may not be able to have the test or why the results may not be helpful include: Being pregnant. An angiogram is not usually done during pregnancy because the radiation could damage the developing baby (fetus). Blockage or curving of the blood vessels caused by atherosclerosis, high blood pressure, or aging. This may make it hard to guide the catheter through the blood vessels or hard to inject the dye. A magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) or computed tomography angiogram (CTA) may be an option instead of an angiogram. Each of these tests is less invasive than a standard angiogram. Some surgeons may want results from a standard angiogram before doing surgery to repair a damaged or abnormal blood vessel.Magnetic Resonance Angiogram (MRA)CT Scan of the Body Magnetic Resonance Angiogram (MRA) CT Scan of the Body For people with kidney problems, diabetes, or dehydration, steps are taken to prevent kidney damage. Less dye may be used or more fluids may be given before, during, and after the test. If you have a history of kidney problems, other blood tests (creatinine, blood urea nitrogen) may be done before an angiogram to make sure that your kidneys are working well.Creatinine and Creatinine ClearanceBlood Urea Nitrogen Creatinine and Creatinine Clearance Blood Urea Nitrogen In rare cases, surgery may be needed to repair a hole in the blood vessel where the catheter was placed. Chernecky CC, Berger BJ (2008). Pagana KD, Pagana TJ (2010)."], [725, "Should I have an amniocentesis?", "Your doctor may suggest amniocentesis if you're at a higher risk of some birth defects. Unlike blood testing, which only shows whether you are at risk, amniocentesis is used to make a diagnosis. The doctor takes a sample of the amniotic fluid that surrounds your baby in your womb. Then a lab tests the sample, checking your baby's chromosomes. Doctors also use amniocentesis to check for infections. And, if you're delivering early, amniocentesis can show if your baby's lungs are strong enough to breathe after birth. It does pose a small risk of miscarriage or other complications. First, the doctor uses ultrasound to locate your baby and pockets of amniotic fluid. Then, the doctor inserts a small needle into your belly to take a sample of amniotic fluid, taking care to keep the needle away from your floating baby. Getting the sample takes about 10 minutes. Doctors can sometimes treat certain birth defects, such as spina bifida, while your baby is still in the womb. Knowing about an issue can also help by increasing monitoring during the pregnancy and help you and your doctor to prepare. If you have complications or are likely to give birth early, you may need it in your third trimester."], [726, "Should I have allergy shots for allergie...", "They aren't a cure, but in time, your symptoms will get better and you may not have symptoms as often. You may want to consider allergy shots -- also called \" immunotherapy\" -- if you have symptoms more than 3 months a year and medicines don't give you enough relief. At first, you'll go to your doctor once or twice a week for several months. It'll contain a tiny amount of the thing you're allergic to -- pollen, pet dander, mold, dust mites, or bee venom, for example. The dose will go up gradually until you get to what's called a maintenance dose. After that, you'll usually get a shot every 2-4 weeks for 4-5 months. Then your doctor will gradually increase the time between shots until you're getting them about once a month for 3-5 years. During that time, your allergy symptoms will get better and may even go away. If your symptoms don't improve after a year of shots, talk with your doctor about other treatment options. You may want to avoid exercise or doing anything strenuous for 2 hours before and after your appointment. You may need to stop allergy shots if you take these medications. If you're pregnant or planning to get pregnant, ask your doctor whether you should continue to get allergy shots. That's to make sure you don't get side effects like itchy eyes, shortness of breath, a runny nose, or a tight throat. Generally, allergy shots work for allergies to bee stings, pollen, dust mites, mold, and pet dander. Get on the phone and go to the nearest emergency room if you have shortness of breath, a tight throat, or any other symptoms that worry you after getting your shot. Called Grastek, Oralair, and Ragwitek, they treat hay fever and boost your tolerance of allergy triggers. In some cases, you may get medicine before you get the dose of the allergen, to help prevent a reaction.

A blocked fallopian tube has a buildup of fluid (hydrosalpinx). Clearing a blockage in the part of the tube closest to the uterus (proximal occlusion) is more likely to be successful. These blockages often are functional (such as a mucus plug) rather than structural (such as scarring or other obstruction). Up to 60 out of 100 women with proximal occlusion have been reported to have successful pregnancies after tubal surgery.2 From 20 to 30 out of 100 women with a blockage near the end of the fallopian tube have had successful pregnancies after tubal surgery.2 The amount of fallopian tube that remains after surgery is critical to the function of the tube.

Online version of BMJ Clinical Evidence: http://www.clinicalevidence.com."], [729, "Should I have a prostate-specific antige...", "Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a substance produced by the prostate gland. Elevated PSA levels may indicate prostate cancer, a noncancerous condition such as prostatitis, or an enlarged prostate. Most men have PSA levels under four (ng/mL) and this has traditionally been used as the cutoff for concern about the risk of prostate cancer. Men with prostate cancer often have PSA levels higher than four, although cancer is a possibility at any PSA level. According to published reports, men who have a prostate gland that feels normal on examination and a PSA less than four have a 15% chance of having prostate cancer. Those with a PSA between four and 10 have a 25% chance of having prostate cancer and if the PSA is higher than 10, the risk increases and can be as high as 67%. In the past, most experts viewed PSA levels less than 4 ng/mL as normal. Due to the findings from more recent studies, some recommend lowering the cutoff levels that determine if a PSA value is normal or elevated. Some researchers encourage using less than 2.5 or 3 ng/mL as a cutoff for normal values, particularly in younger patients. Younger patients tend to have smaller prostates and lower PSA values, so any elevation of the PSA in younger men above 2.5 ng/mL is a cause for concern. Just as important as the PSA number is the trend of that number (whether it is going up, how quickly, and over what period of time). Conversely, low levels of PSA in the bloodstream do not rule out the possibility of prostate cancer. The American Cancer Society says men should talk to their doctors about the benefits, risks, and limitations of prostate cancer screening before deciding whether to be tested. The group's guidelines make it clear that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood testing should not occur unless this discussion happens. They recommend that most men at average risk for prostate cancer start the discussion at age 50 and those with higher risk for prostate cancer should start the discussion earlier. To reduce the harms of screening, a routine screening interval of two years or more may be preferred over annual screening in those men who have decided on screening after a discussion with their doctor. As compared to annual screening, it is expected that screening intervals of two years preserve the majority of the benefits and reduce over diagnosis and false positives. Routine PSA screening is not recommended in men over age 70 or any man with less than a 10-15 year life expectancy. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, however, doesn't recommend routine PSA screening for men in the general population, regardless of age. If your doctor is concerned that you might have prostate cancer based on either a PSA level or a rectal exam, a biopsy (a lab testing of a small amount of tissue from the prostate) will be the next step. Elevated PSA levels may indicate prostate cancer or a noncancerous condition such as prostatitis or an enlarged prostate. If your PSA level is high, your doctor may recommend that you get a prostate biopsy to test for cancer. There are some new PSA tests that may help you and your health care provider determine if you need a biopsy. The percentage of free PSA is lower in men who have prostate cancer than in men who do not. Studies show that if your PSA results are in the borderline range (4 to 10), a low percent-free PSA (less than 10%) means that the likelihood of having prostate cancer is about 50% and that you should probably have a biopsy. Even when the total PSA value isn't higher than 4, a high PSA velocity (an increase greater than 0.75 ng/mL in one year) suggests that cancer may be present and a biopsy should be considered. This urine test looks for a fusion of genes that is present in 50% of PSA-tested men with prostate cancer. Although the PSA test is used mainly to screen for prostate cancer, it is valuable in other situations: To guide treatment. Along with a doctor's exam and tumor stage, the PSA test can help determine how advanced a prostate cancer is. A rising PSA level can mean that prostate cancer cells are present and your cancer has come back. If you choose a \"watchful waiting\" approach to treatment, the PSA level can help determine if the disease is progressing and if active treatment should be considered. During hormonal therapy, the PSA level can help indicate how well the treatment is working or when it may be time to try another treatment."], [730, "Should I have a magnetic resonance image...", "In many cases, an MRI gives different information than an X-ray, an ultrasound, or a CT scan. For an MRI, your body is placed inside a machine that contains a strong magnet. Pictures from an MRI can be saved and stored on a computer for further study. In some cases, a contrast material may be used during the MRI to show certain parts of the body more clearly. The MRI can find changes in the spine and in other tissues. MRI can look at the spine in the neck (cervical), upper back (thoracic), or lower back (lumbosacral). More detailed pictures of one area, such as the lumbar spine, may be taken. You may be able to have an MRI with an open machine that doesn't enclose your entire body. The pictures from an open MRI may not be as good as those from a standard MRI machine . Health Tools help you make wise health decisions or take action to improve your health. An MRI of the spine is done to: Find problems of the spinal discs, such as a ruptured disc. The test may also show if a disc is pressing on a nerve, causing symptoms such as sciatica. Find areas of the spine where the canal is abnormally narrowed (spinal stenosis) and may need surgery. The tumors that most commonly spread to the spine include those from prostate, breast, or lung cancer. Check areas of joint inflammation (arthritis) or bone loss found during an X-ray test or a bone scan. Find nerve damage caused by injury or disease, such as multiple sclerosis. Check problems of the spine that have been present since birth (congenital). The contrast material also may help tell the difference between old surgical scars and a new disease or injury. Before your MRI test, tell your doctor and the MRI technologist if you: Are allergic to any medicines. If you know that you are allergic to the contrast material used for the MRI, tell your doctor before having another test. Have a health condition, such as diabetes, sickle cell anemia, or kidney problems. You may need to change your medicine schedule. And some conditions may prevent you from having an MRI using contrast material. Tell your doctor if you have:Heart and blood vessel devices such as a coronary artery stent, a pacemaker, an ICD (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator), or a metal heart valve.Metal pins, clips, or metal parts in your body, including artificial limbs and dental work or braces.Any other implanted medical device, such as a medicine infusion pump or a cochlear implant.Cosmetic metal implants, such as in your ears, or tattooed eyeliner.

Metal pins, clips, or metal parts in your body, including artificial limbs and dental work or braces. Any other implanted medical device, such as a medicine infusion pump or a cochlear implant. Cosmetic metal implants, such as in your ears, or tattooed eyeliner. You need to lie very still inside the MRI magnet, so you may need medicine to help you relax. You may be asked to sign a consent form that says you understand the risks of the test and agree to have it done. Talk to your doctor about any concerns you have regarding the need for the test, its risks, how it will be done, or what the results will mean. To help you understand the importance of this test, fill out the medical test information form(What is a PDF document?). But some other types of doctors can also read an MRI scan. You will need to remove all metal objects (such as hearing aids, dentures, jewelry, watches, and hairpins) from your body, because these objects may be attracted to the powerful magnet used for the test. If you are allowed to keep some of your clothes on, you should empty your pockets of any coins and cards (such as credit cards or ATM cards) with scanner strips on them. During the test, you usually lie on your back on a table that is part of the MRI scanner. Your head, chest, and arms may be held with straps to help you remain still. A device called a coil may be placed over or wrapped around the area to be scanned. If you feel very nervous inside the machine, you may be given a sedative to help you relax. You may be able to have an MRI with an open machine that doesn't enclose your entire body. The pictures from an open MRI may not be as good as those from a standard MRI machine . Inside the scanner you will hear a fan and feel air moving. You may also hear tapping or snapping noises as the MRI scans are taken. During the test, you may be alone in the scanner room. If contrast material is needed, the technologist will put it in an intravenous (IV) line in your arm. You will not have pain from the magnetic field or radio waves used for the MRI. The table you lie on may feel hard, and the room may be cool. You may be tired or sore from lying in one position for a long time. If a contrast material is used, you may feel some coolness when it is put into your IV. In rare cases, you may feel: A tingling feeling in the mouth if you have metal dental fillings. Tell the technologist if you have nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, pain, burning, or breathing problems. The magnet may affect pacemakers, artificial limbs, and other medical devices that contain iron. Any loose metal object has the risk of causing damage or injury if it gets pulled toward the strong magnet. If you may have metal fragments in the eye, an X-ray of the eyes may be done before the MRI. Iron pigments in tattoos or tattooed eyeliner can cause skin or eye irritation. Be sure to tell your health professional if you are wearing a patch. There is a slight risk of an allergic reaction if contrast material is used during the MRI. If you breastfeed and are concerned about whether the dye used in this test is safe, talk to your doctor. But if you prefer, you can store some of your breast milk ahead of time and use it for a day or two after the test. Complete results are usually ready for your doctor in 1 to 2 days. Reasons you may not be able to have the test or why the results may not be helpful include: Pregnancy. Medical devices that use electronics, such as a pacemaker or medicine infusion pump. The MRI magnet may cause problems with these devices, and that may keep you from having an MRI. For example, any metal in your spine may prevent your doctor from seeing it clearly. Many modern medical devices that do not use electronics-such as heart valves, stents, or clips-can be safely placed in most MRI machines. The safety of MRI scans with these stronger MRI magnets in people with medical devices is not known. Sometimes your MRI test results may be different from the results of CT, ultrasound, or X-ray tests, because the MRI scan shows tissue differently. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine can often be used instead of other tests that use X-rays, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or myelography.

If you have pain only, hormone therapy to lower your body's estrogen levels will shrink the implants and may reduce pain. If you want to become pregnant, having surgery, infertility treatment, or both may help. And endometriosis doesn't always get worse over time. If you have mild pain, have no plans for a future pregnancy, or are near menopause (around age 50), you may not feel a need for treatment. If you have pain or bleeding but aren't planning to get pregnant soon, birth control hormones (patch, pills, or ring) or anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) may be all that you need to control pain. Birth control hormones are likely to keep endometriosis from getting worse.4 If you have severe symptoms or if birth control hormones and NSAIDs don't work, you might try a stronger hormone therapy. Besides medicine, you can try other things at home to help with the pain. If hormone therapy doesn't work or if growths are affecting other organs, surgery is the next step. It is only used when you have no pregnancy plans and have had little relief from other treatments. If you are having trouble becoming pregnant even after surgery, you can consider trying fertility drugs with insemination or in vitro fertilization."], [732, "Should I give my child antibiotics for a...", "The first treatment of a middle ear infection focuses on relieving pain. If your child's condition improves in the first couple of days, treating the symptoms at home may be all that is needed. Follow-up exams with a doctor are important to check for persistent infection, fluid behind the eardrum (otitis media with effusion), or repeat infections. Even if your child seems well, he or she may need a follow-up visit in about 4 weeks, especially if your child is young. Your doctor can give your child antibiotics, but ear infections often get better without them. Whether you use antibiotics will depend on how old your child is and how bad the infection is. If your child has cochlear implants, your doctor will probably prescribe antibiotics, because serious complications of ear infections, including bacterial meningitis, are more common in children who have cochlear implants than in children who do not have cochlear implants. If a child has repeat ear infections (three or more ear infections in a 6-month period or four in 1 year), you may want to consider treatment to prevent future infections. One option that has been used a lot in the past is long-term oral antibiotic treatment. There is debate within the medical community about using antibiotics on a long-term basis to prevent ear infections. Having tubes put in the ears is another option for treating repeat ear infections. If a child has fluid behind the eardrum for more than 3 months and has significant hearing problems, then treatment is needed. Sometimes short-term hearing loss occurs, which is especially a concern in children ages 2 and younger. This is also why children in this age group are closely watched when they have ear infections. The doctor might also suggest placing tubes in the ears to drain the fluid and improve hearing. Doctors may consider surgery for children who have repeat ear infections or for those who have persistent fluid behind the eardrum. Procedures include inserting ear tubes or removing adenoids and, in rare cases, the tonsils. Children who get rare but serious problems from ear infections, such as infection in the tissues around the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) or infection in the bone behind the ear (mastoiditis), need treatment right away."], [733, "Should I consider adoption as an alterna...", "You may wish to consider adoption as an alternative to treatment for infertility. Learning more about the tests, exams, success rates, and costs of infertility treatment may help you decide. Adoption provides people with an opportunity to raise and nurture a child.

When a pregnancy involves three or more fetuses (high-order pregnancy), the risks of miscarriage, stillbirth, and lifelong disability increase with each additional fetus. Assisted reproductive technology (ART) and fertility drugs have greatly increased the number of multiple pregnancies. The goal of MFPR is to increase the chance of a successful, healthy pregnancy. Multifetal pregnancy reduction: Is usually done early in a pregnancy, between the 9th and 12th weeks. Is known as \"selective termination\" when it involves a fetus with severe defects or one that is expected to die later in the pregnancy, which would threaten the life of the surviving fetus or fetuses. For this procedure, the doctor uses ultrasound as a guide and inserts a needle through the woman's abdomen and into the uterus to the selected fetus. A successful MFPR increases the chances of healthy survival for the remaining fetuses and reduces risks to you. But MFPR sometimes leads to miscarriage of the remaining fetuses, preterm labor, or infection. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists strongly recommend careful use of infertility treatment in the effort to avoid the risks of a triplet-or-more pregnancy and of MFPR.

You can follow up with radiation or chemotherapy if the doctor finds the cancer has spread. The actual surgery usually takes about 30 minutes, and you usually go home the same day. Sometimes, the surgery to take out a testicle isn't enough, because cancer has spread to the lymph nodes at the back of the abdomen. Your doctor may take those out as well. Sometimes, your doctor can take out the lymph nodes using much smaller cuts and long, thin tools. Your doctor may find he's gotten all the cancer and it hasn't spread. But he'll want you to come in for regular check-ups to make sure it hasn't returned. Your doctor may want to give you radiation or chemotherapy if you have an advanced case. This uses X-rays or other high-energy beams to destroy cancer cells. Sometimes, the lymph nodes at the back of the abdomen are radiated to kill any tumor cells that may have spread to them. Side effects: You could feel very tired, want to throw up or have diarrhea. Doctors try to protect your remaining testicle from radiation, which can affect your sperm count. If you want to have children in the future, you should ask your doctor about saving some of your sperm before you start. This uses medicine to fight cancer cells, either by killing them or stopping them from splitting into more and more cells. You may take pills or get drugs through a tube placed in a vein. Your doctor might suggest that you get \"chemo,\" as it is often called, either before or after you have lymph node surgery. You might get several rounds of treatment that last for 3 or 4 weeks each, and you would take breaks in between them. Side effects of chemo often include: Nausea Hair loss Loss of energy More chance of infections Problems with your kidneys, lungs, or nerves Your doctor has ways to help you ease or even prevent these side effects, sometimes by taking other drugs. Or, you might also want to do things to help yourself, such as getting foods that are easier to eat. Chemo is also likely to leave you infertile. As with radiation therapy, talk to your doctor about saving your sperm if you want children in the future. But if you have a cancer that needs a stronger treatment, this procedure helps your body handle even higher doses of chemotherapy. In some cases, another person donates some of their blood or marrow. After your chemo, they are thawed and returned back to you through a process called infusion. It's normal to have a lot of strong feelings when you're dealing with cancer.

Surgery may be considered if: Your child has a moderate to severe curve, and the curve is getting worse. The main type of surgery for scoliosis involves attaching rods to the spine and doing a spinal fusion. Spinal fusion is used to stabilize and reduce the size of the curve and stop the curve from getting worse by permanently joining the vertebrae into a solid mass of bone. Other techniques are sometimes used, including instrumentation without fusion, which attaches devices such as metal rods to the spine to stabilize a spinal curve without fusing the spine together. This is only done in very young children when a fusion, which stops the growth of the fused part of the spine, is not desirable. Spinal fusion stops the growth of the fused part of the spine.

Because they're so far back in your mouth, wisdom teeth may not come in normally. Your mouth isn't big enough. You may not be able to reach your wisdom teeth with your toothbrush or dental floss. You'll meet with the oral surgeon to talk about the process. Plan time off from work or school to have your surgery and rest afterward at home. You'll get one of these types of anesthesia so you don't feel pain during the removal: Local: Your doctor will numb your mouth with a shot of Novocaine in your gums.You may also breathe nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, to relax or even doze during surgery. IV sedation: The surgeon will numb your mouth and also give you drugs through a vein in your arm to make you drowsy. General: You'll either get drugs through a vein or breathe gas in through a mask. You'll be asleep the whole time and might not wake up for an hour or so after the surgery. Your doctor may have to cut your gums or bone to get the teeth out. If so, he'll stitch the wounds shut so they heal quickly. He may also stuff gauze pads in your mouth to soak up some of the blood. If you had a local anesthetic and feel alert, you might be able to drive home to begin your recovery. You might even be able to go back to work or do your normal activities. If you had general anesthesia or still feel drowsy, you'll need someone to drive you home. You'll likely have swelling and mild discomfort for 3 or so days. Your mouth may need a few weeks to completely heal. Here are some tips for the first 3 days after surgery: Dos: Use an ice pack on your face to curb swelling or skin color changes. Take the drugs your doctor prescribes to ease pain or swelling. Call your doctor if you have a fever, or if your pain or swelling doesn't improve. Don'ts: Don't drink through a straw. Don't rinse your mouth too harshly. Your doctor may suggest rinsing gently with saltwater. Don't eat hard, crunchy, or sticky foods that may scratch your wounds."], [743, "Short Bowel Syndrome", "Your bowels are made up of two parts -- the large intestine, also called the colon, and the small intestine. Short bowel syndrome usually affects people who've had a lot of their small intestine removed. Without this part, your body can't get enough nutrients and water from the food you eat. This causes bowel troubles, like diarrhea, which can be dangerous if you go without treatment. If you learn you have short bowel syndrome, know that doctors can do a lot of things to ease your symptoms and make sure you get the right nutrition. Over time, your body may adjust to having a shorter small intestine, and you may be able to take fewer medicines. Those with short bowel syndrome usually have at least half of their small intestine missing or removed. Most often, short bowel syndrome happens after surgery to remove a large part of the small intestine. Doctors may remove the small intestine as part of a treatment for: Crohn's disease, a lifelong inflammatory bowel disease that causes belly pain, diarrhea, and other digestive problems Cancer Damage from cancer treatment, like radiation therapy Bowel injury The main symptom of short bowel syndrome is diarrhea that doesn't go away. You or your child may also have: Cramping Bloating Gas Heartburn Weakness Fatigue Weight loss Since your body has trouble getting nutrients and vitamins from food, it can also cause: Anemia (not enough red blood cells) Easy bruising Fatty liver Gallstones Kidney stones Bone pain and osteoporosis (thinning and fragile bones) Trouble eating certain foods If you're having any symptoms and you've had a lot of your small intestine removed, your doctor may already suspect short bowel syndrome. To be sure, he'll do a physical exam and may run other tests, including: Blood tests Stool exam X-rays of your chest and belly Upper GI series, also called a barium X-ray. You'll drink a special liquid that coats your throat, stomach, and small intestine to make them stand out on the X-ray image. CT scan, a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures inside your body Ultrasound, which uses sound waves to make images of your organs Bone density test Liver biopsy, when doctors remove a piece of tissue for testing. Most of the time, doctors make a small cut on your belly and use a hollow needle to get the cells they need. Along with the tests, your doctor will probably also ask you questions about your symptoms, like: How are you feeling? If your child has short bowel syndrome, ask your doctor how you can make sure he's getting the nutrition he needs to grow. Treatment has two goals: to ease symptoms and give you enough vitamins and minerals. For mild cases, you may need to have several small meals a day, along with extra fluids, vitamins, and minerals. Treatment is the same for moderate cases, but from time to time, you may need extra fluids and minerals through an IV. For more serious cases, you may get an IV feeding tube instead of eating meals. Or, you may have a tube placed directly into your stomach or small intestine. Your doctor may suggest surgery, including a transplant of part or all of your small intestine. A new organ can cure small bowel syndrome, but a transplant is major surgery.Doctors usually recommend it only when other treatments haven't worked. If you choose this option, your doctor will put you on a waiting list for a small intestine from a donor. Depending on your condition, there are other treatments that may help your small intestine absorb more nutrients and water. Doctors may prescribe this hormone for adults with more serious cases of short bowel syndrome who need IV feeding tubes. L-glutamine, a powder that you can mix with water and drink. It may help your small intestine absorb more nutrients, some studies have shown. It may help your intestines work better on their own, so you won't need as much nutritional support. It's very important to make sure children with short bowel syndrome get enough calories and nutrients, since they are still growing. Talk to a doctor or a dietitian about what kinds of food are best. They get what doctors call intestinal adaptation, when the small intestine is able to adjust to its shorter length and work as it should. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for you. It's hard to deal with symptoms like diarrhea, but short bowel syndrome doesn't have to take over your life. It's important that you keep in touch with your doctor and follow your treatment plan so you can keep things in control. You can also take steps to feel better, like: Know what to eat. There's no single diet plan for people with short bowel syndrome, but in general, you should make sure to eat lean protein (meat, dairy products, eggs, tofu) and carbs that are low in fiber (white rice, pasta, white bread). Your doctor can tell you how much and what kinds of activity are right for you. If you're using an IV for treatment, ask for one that you can carry with you. Family, friends, and members of your community can help you run errands, get rides to the doctor, or just let you vent about the stresses of treatment. Support groups can be a great way to get advice and understanding from other people living with short bowel syndrome. By working closely with your doctor, you can keep your symptoms under control and lead an active life. Short bowel syndrome can be very serious if you don't follow your treatment plan. You can become dehydrated, and there's a chance your body won't get enough nutrients. For some people, the condition gets better, and they don't need a lot of treatment after a while. Whether your short bowel syndrome goes away depends on your age, how healthy you are, how much of your small and large intestines remain, and whether you have another condition like Crohn's disease.

Shigellosis is spread when the bacteria in feces (stool) or on soiled fingers are ingested. Shigellosis is often found in day care centers, nursing homes, refugee camps, and other places where conditions are crowded and sanitation is poor. Shigellosis is likely to occur among toddlers who are not fully toilet trained. Family members and playmates of infected children are also at high risk of becoming infected. Food may become contaminated by infected food handlers who do not wash their hands with soap after using the bathroom. Also, flies can breed in infected feces and then contaminate food. Water may become contaminated if sewage runs into it or if someone with shigellosis swims in it. Shigellosis also can be spread through sex, especially through anal and oral sex. The symptoms of shigellosis include diarrhea (often bloody), fever, and stomach cramps starting 1 or 2 days after you are exposed to the bacteria. In some people, especially young children and older adults, the diarrhea can be so severe that a hospital stay is needed. Because many different diseases can cause a fever and bloody diarrhea, lab tests are the best way to diagnose shigellosis. Your doctor will most likely still do a physical exam and ask you questions about your symptoms, foods you have recently eaten, and your work and home environments. Blood tests may be done if your symptoms are severe or to rule out other causes. Because using antibiotics can make these bacteria even more resistant, mild cases of shigellosis are often not treated with antibiotics. To prevent dehydration, take frequent sips of a rehydration drink (such as Pedialyte). Soda and fruit juices have too much sugar and not enough of the important electrolytes that are lost during diarrhea, and they should not be used to rehydrate. You can help prevent the spread of shigellosis by washing your hands frequently and carefully with soap, especially if you work or spend time in day care centers or with children who are not completely toilet trained. When possible, keep young children with shigellosis who are still in diapers away from uninfected children. If your child is in diapers and has shigellosis, after diaper changing, wipe the changing area with a disinfectant such as diluted household bleach and put the diapers in a closed-lid garbage can. People who have shigellosis should not prepare food or pour water for others. Shigella are present in the diarrhea of people with shigellosis and for 1 or 2 weeks after symptoms have stopped.

You may not be able to hear someone speaking, even if they are using a normal voice. You may be able to hear only very loud sounds. Hearing loss can happen in many different ways to people of all ages. The key is to work with your health care team to find ways help you make the most of the hearing you have. Babies can be born with severe hearing loss, and children and adults can get it at any point in their lives. It can happen suddenly or over many years, in one or both ears, and be brief or long-lasting. To understand how hearing loss happens, it helps to know how your ear works. They pass electrical signals to the main hearing nerve, called the cochlear nerve, which leads to the brain. Over half of babies born with severe hearing loss, it's because of a faulty gene. Babies also can lose their hearing because of a problem in the womb. Pregnant women who take certain medicines, such as the cancer drug thalidomide or drugs for tuberculosis, may have a baby with severe hearing loss. A single very loud noise, like a gunshot or explosion, can damage hearing. So can being around loud noises for a long time, like living next to an airport runway. Different conditions can put the ears or nerves involved in hearing at risk, including ear infections, brain tumors, rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, or Meniere's disease, a disorder of the inner ear. Certain drugs, including some that treat cancer, heart disease, and serious infections, can damage your ear and cause hearing loss. Sometimes, it's permanent, but in other cases, the problem goes away after you stop taking the medicines. If your child has trouble hearing, you'll probably notice it by the way she behaves. Some signs include: A hard time learning to speak, or speaking later than other children her age Not paying attention to sounds or when people call her Poor school work If hearing loss is affecting you, you may notice that you have a hard time interacting with others because you can't hear them. Signs include: Trouble hearing people speak in groups or in noisy places Can't hear someone behind you speaking Think other people are mumbling when they are speaking Trouble hearing people on the phone Listen to the television or car radio at a very loud volume Don't hear the alarm clock It's important to diagnose severe hearing loss as early as possible, especially for children. In some states, laws require medical staff to screen newborns for hearing before they leave the hospital. If your baby doesn't get a test, ask hospital staff where you can get one. A machine measures her hearing nerve's response to soft clicks or tones. If your child shows any symptoms of severe hearing loss as she gets older, talk to your pediatrician. Your doctor may refer you to a hearing specialist called an otolaryngologist or otologist. She may ask you: Do you often feel as if people are speaking too quietly or mumbling? How hard is it to hear someone speak in a loud or noisy place? For a child with hearing problems, the doctor may ask you: How does your child respond when you call her name or make sounds at home? The doctor may tell you to see an audiologist, a professional trained in treating hearing problems. Also in the booth with headphones, you'll hear different words at different volumes and repeat them to the audiologist. You'll lie down in the sound booth, and the audiologist will put a recording sensor in your ear. It measures the electric signals made by the nerves in your inner ear in response to sound. For a child with hearing loss, the audiologist may want to see how well she responds to instructions. If you have severe hearing loss, you'll want to ask your doctor questions about your condition, like: What caused my hearing loss? If your child has severe hearing loss, you'll also want to ask: What will my child need at school to deal with hearing loss? Will the hearing loss continue to get worse? Treatment for severe hearing loss usually means using different technology to improve the hearing you have. Your doctor will recommend one based on how much hearing you've lost, how healthy you are, your lifestyle, and how your ears were damaged. They make low sounds louder or easier to hear. You can take them out when it's time to sleep, swim, or shower. An audiologist will place them in your or your child's ears, and they can stay there for months. Cochlear implants help people who have such severe hearing loss that hearing aids don't help. They don't cure hearing loss, but they can give children and adults the sensation of sound. In the hospital, a surgeon places the cochlear implant inside the ear, tiny electrodes next to your cochlear nerve, and a receiver right under the skin behind your ear. About 4 weeks later, you'll see the doctor again to get the outside parts of the implant, including a microphone, a transmitter, and a small computer called a speech processor. These parts send signals to the device in your ear to translate the sounds around you. You can wear them behind your ear like a hearing aid. It can take a long time after the surgery to get cochlear implants to work best for you or your child. You'll need support from hearing specialists and language therapists to learn how to use the device and respond to the sounds you can hear. Your doctor will help you decide if you or your child are a good fit for this therapy. It can be hard to lose your hearing, whether suddenly or over many years. If your child has severe hearing loss, you may worry about the parts of life that she'll miss. As you work with your doctor to pick a treatment plan, you can take steps to make life easier for you or your child. For your child: Therapy can help your child learn to use a hearing aid and find ways to communicate. A family or a speech therapist can teach her to say words clearly so others understand. She can also learn how to use other techniques, including sign language, natural gestures, and speech reading. Talk to your child's school and see what they can do to help her in the classroom. She may be able to use HATS, or Hearing Assistive Technology Systems, small FM radio frequency devices that make sounds easier to hear. Teachers speak into a special microphone that sends sounds to a small receiver that your child uses to hear the lessons. For yourself: Work with an audiologist to learn ways to deal with noisy places or group conversations. Use HATS that make your alarms, phone, or television easier to hear. Place carpet or rugs on floors to cut down on noise. It may help to talk to a therapist or counselor to deal with any worry or sadness you or your child may feel. Also, support groups of other families dealing with severe hearing loss are great places to get advice and understanding. Severe hearing loss is different for everyone. It may affect you or your child for many years. You should be able to live independently, go to school or college, and have a career with severe hearing loss. It's important to diagnose and treat severe hearing loss as soon as possible. The sooner you or your child can begin therapy, the better you'll be able to adapt. Connect with others who are living with severe hearing loss or get helpful information from patient groups like the Hearing Loss Association of America."], [751, "Schilder Disease", "Adrenoleukodystrophy is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder caused by an abnormality in the ABCD1 gene on the X chromosome. Some affected individuals have adrenal insufficiency, which means that reduced amounts of certain hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol are produced, leading to abnormalities in blood pressure, heart rate, sexual development and reproduction. This condition has been categorized into six types based on symptoms and age of onset: childhood cerebral ALD, adolescent cerebral ALD, adrenomyeloneuropathy, adult cerebral ALD, adrenal insufficiency only and ALD that occurs in females."], [752, "Scarlet Fever", "Scarlet fever -- also called scarlatina -- is an infection that's easily spread from person to person. Most often, the rash begins on the face and neck and then spreads to the rest of the body. If your child has strep throat, there's a chance he will also develop scarlet fever. Scarlet fever can also be linked to burns or wounds that become infected -- your own or the infected wounds of another person. Anyone can get scarlet fever, but it's most common in kids from 5 to 15 years old. It's most often spread by contact with the droplets emitted when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can even be spread if you touch something -- like a plate or glass - on which these droplets have landed."], [753, "Scars", "A scar results from the biologic process of wound repair in the skin and other tissues. Most wounds, except for very minor ones, result in some degree of scarring. Scars can result from accidents, diseases, skin conditions such as acne, or surgeries. Scars form when the dermis (deep, thick layer of skin) is damaged. The body forms new collagen fibers (a naturally occurring protein in the body) to mend the damage, resulting in a scar. However, in cases when the body produces too much collagen, scars can be raised. This kind of scarring occurs when underlying structures supporting the skin (for example, fat or muscle) are lost. Scars also can appear as stretched skin. Such scars result when the skin stretches rapidly (for example, as in growth spurts or during pregnancy). In addition, this type of scar can occur when the skin is under tension (near a joint, for example) during the healing process. Although scars cannot be completely removed, their appearance can be improved to some extent. Methods for improving the appearance of scars include: Topical treatments, such as vitamin E, cocoa butter cream, and several commercial skin care products sold over the counter may be somewhat effective in helping to heal scars. Surgery is not recommended in cases of hypertrophic or keloid scarring (raised scars) because there is a risk of recurring scars as well as more severe scarring that results from the treatment. Injections may help to soften the appearance of keloid or hypertrophic scars. Low-dose, superficial radiotherapy is used to prevent recurrence of severe keloid and hypertrophic scarring. This treatment involves the removal of the surface of the skin with special equipment. Dermabrasion is useful to blend in the irregularities of a scar whether it is raised or depressed. This procedure, similar to dermabrasion, removes the surface layers of the skin using different types of lasers. These treatments can be used to raise sunken scars to the level of surrounding skin. The effects of these injections are only temporary, however, and the procedures may need to be regularly repeated. Newer forms of injectable fillers are now on the market and may be an option for some people. Many small puncture holes are made into the superficial skin to stimulate collagen production and even introduce collagen stimulators or other products to try to reduce the appearance of scars."], [754, "Scapuloperoneal Muscular Dystrophy", "Scapuloperoneal myopathy is a rare genetic disorder characterized by weakness and wasting of certain muscles. Symptoms are usually limited to the shoulder blade area (scapula) and the smaller of the two leg muscle groups below the knee (peroneal). The leg symptoms often appear before the shoulder muscles become weakened. The rate of progression of the disorder varies from case to case."], [755, "Scapula Elevata", "Sprengel Deformity is a rare congenital disorder in which the shoulder blade is displaced upward. The elevated shoulder blade causes a lump in the back of the base of the neck and may limit movement of the arm on the affected side."], [756, "Scaphoid Fracture of the Wrist", "A navicular fracture (also called a scaphoid fracture) is a break in a small bone on the thumb side of your wrist. It is important to find out if you have a navicular fracture, because navicular fractures need treatment to heal well. Without treatment, and sometimes with treatment, healing can be slow and difficult because parts of the navicular bone don't have a good blood supply. If your navicular bone does not heal well, you can have long-term pain, stiffness, or arthritis in your wrist. Navicular fractures often happen while a person is playing sports such as football, soccer, or basketball or during activities, such as in-line skating, skateboarding, or bike riding. If the bone is broken, you may have: Pain, tenderness, or swelling on the thumb side of your wrist. If you have fallen on an outstretched hand and your wrist hurts, be sure to see a doctor to find out if you have any broken bones. He or she will then look at your wrist, find any swollen or tender areas, and see how well you are able to move your wrist and thumb. Other times, an X-ray may not show signs of a fracture. If your doctor is not sure if your wrist is broken, he or she may refer you to an orthopedist, a doctor who specializes in bone problems. Because fractures can't always be seen right away, you may need a follow-up X-ray in 1 to 2 weeks. In the meantime, to prevent possible long-term problems, you will be treated as if you do have a fracture. In some cases, other imaging tests such as MRIs, CT scans, and bone scans are used to look for navicular fractures. Even if the first X-rays do not show a fracture, your doctor still may treat you to prevent possible problems with healing. Right after the injury, you may wear a splint because your wrist is too swollen to put a cast on. You may also wear a splint if it is not clear whether your bone is broken. For the first few days, your doctor may tell you to keep your wrist higher than the level of your heart and to use cold packs or ice to reduce swelling. He or she may also prescribe a pain medicine or suggest a pain medicine that you can buy without a prescription, such as acetaminophen (for example, Tylenol) or ibuprofen (for example, Advil or Motrin). Some people only need to wear a cast for 6 weeks, while others may have to wear a cast for several months. Regular visits to your doctor will help you to know how well your fracture is healing and learn how to care for your splint or cast. In other cases, you may need surgery to put pieces of your bone in the proper place or to help your bone heal faster. You may also need surgery if part of your bone has died because it did not get enough blood. If you have surgery, you will need to wear a splint or cast afterward. Once a splint or cast is removed, your arm or wrist may feel weak or stiff. Your doctor or a physical therapist can teach you exercises to strengthen your arm and wrist."], [757, "Shingles Understanding Shingles -- Symptoms", "You can think of shingles as the one-two punch of infections. Anyone who ever gets it had a case of the chickenpox first, often many decades earlier. Chickenpox causes itchy blisters that might start on your back, chest, and face and spread to the rest of your body. If you start to feel tingly and itchy on one side of your torso and then notice a rash, call your doctor. She can examine you and figure out whether you have shingles. When it gets into your body, the first problem it causes is chickenpox, also called varicella. Doctors don't know why, but sometimes the virus \"wakes up\" and travels along nerve fibers to your skin. We know that a weakened immune system might wake the virus up. If you've had chickenpox, you're more likely to get shingles if you: Have cancer, HIV, or another disease that lower your body's defenses Are 50 or older Are under a lot of stress Have had a physical trauma Take long-term steroids or other medicines that can weaken your immune system But many people who get shingles do not fit in any of these categories. If you have shingles, you'll most likely see a row of raised dots pop up on one side of your body or face. You may also feel: A tingling feeling in or under your skin Fever, chills, and headache An upset stomach The rash eventually turns into painful, red, fluid-filled blisters. Shingles can't be cured once you're infected, but treatment can lessen how long it lasts and make you feel better. You can spread the varicella zoster virus to people who've never had chickenpox and haven't been vaccinated. Until then, avoid pregnant women who may not have had chickenpox or the vaccine, people with weak immune systems, and newborns.

Shaken baby syndrome is a form of child abuse. When a baby is shaken hard by the shoulders, arms, or legs, it can cause learning disabilities, behavior disorders, vision problems or blindness, hearing and speech issues, seizures, cerebral palsy, serious brain injury, and permanent disability. When a baby is shaken, its brain can bounce between the front and back of its skull. Shaken baby syndrome is different from gently tossing a baby playfully into the air or bouncing a baby on your knee. Though their brains and necks are fragile, babies are also unlikely to get shaken injuries by falling off furniture or making sudden stops in a car. Symptoms include vomiting, bluish skin, tremors or shakes, breathing issues, and drowsiness. You may notice bruises on the arms or chest in the places the baby has been grabbed. Other physical signs include a larger than usual head or forehead, different-sized pupils, not being able to focus, and favoring one arm or leg over another. Babies with shaken baby syndrome may also have symptoms you can't see, such as fractured ribs or other bones, spinal cord or neck injury, and bleeding in the brain. In mild cases, behavior, health, or learning issues show up later on. Because shaken baby syndrome can affect so many different parts of a child's health, there may be more than one doctor or specialist involved in the diagnosis. Depending on the child's level of injury, the tests may be done in doctor's offices or a pediatric intensive care unit. To check the brain, doctors may use computerized tomography, or a CT scan, to X-ray for injuries that need immediate attention. Radio waves and magnetic fields in the form of magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, also show doctors detailed areas of the brain. X-rays of other body parts, like the arms, legs, spine, and skull, show fractures and whether they were created by force or accident. Some disorders can mimic the symptoms of shaken baby syndrome. Treatment for shaken baby syndrome depends on the injury. Shaken baby syndrome is 100% preventable. -- understand two things: The dangers of shaking a baby, even for a few seconds. The National Center for shaken baby syndrome calls it PURPLE crying: Peak pattern: At 2-3 months old, babies cry the most. Long bouts of crying: Babies can cry for hours at a time. Evening crying: Some babies cry more in the afternoon and evening. Sometimes you can stop the crying by rubbing the baby's back, singing, using \"white noise\" from an app or the sound of running water, taking a walk, or using a pacifier. As you talk, check on the baby every 5 or 10 minutes. If you notice your caregiver or another parent struggling, be supportive and suggest a safe place they can take the baby when they need a break.

When these tiny mites infect the scalp and skin, they trigger intense itching. The type you have depends on the part of your body that's affected: Head lice affect the scalp. Body lice affect other areas of the body and are often found in seams of clothing. This article will focus on head lice, a very common condition among kids in elementary and middle school. They can cause such intense itching that your child could lose sleep over it. It's uncomfortable, but lice won't make you sick. You can get lice even if you shower regularly and have super-clean hair. These pesky creatures don't fly or jump -- they crawl over to the closest head they can find. This is called head-to-head contact, and most people get lice this way. Then you can take steps to keep your child comfortable and keep the mites from spreading throughout your home. Head lice usually stay close to the scalp and behind the ears. Female adult lice lay six to eight eggs a day on your scalp, and they spread from there. There are three forms of lice to watch for: Nits, or lice eggs. They stick like glue to the end of each hair closest to the scalp and are hard to remove. When they do, they leave behind clear shells, which remain stuck to the hair shaft. It feeds on the blood on your scalp and keeps growing for 9 to 12 days. Nymphs (and adult lice) move quickly and avoid light. Adult lice are about 2 to 3 millimeters long, about the size of a sesame seed. The color can be lighter or darker, depending on the shade of your hair. Adult lice have six legs with claws at the end that allow them to latch tightly to your hair. Typically, adult head lice live 30 days when stuck to your head. If you spot lice, tell your child's school so they can properly clean classroom items and stop the spread.

This classification is based on the pattern of inheritance or mode of genetic transmission of the disorder: i.e., autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X-linked. The autosomal dominant ataxias, also called the spinocerebellar ataxias, are usually identified as SCA1 through SCA37. Also included are several \"episodic ataxias\", as well as a very rare disorder known as DRPLA (dentato-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy).

Safe sex can actually enhance your sex life by increasing communication and trust between you and your sexual partners. The safest way to prevent HIV or STIs, of course, is abstinence, which is no sex at all. Next, the safest sex is sex that is shared between two people who are not infected with any STIs (including HIV), who only have sex with each other, and who don't use injectable drugs. If your partner is infected with HIV or another STI, or you don't know your partner's sexual history, the safest sexual activities include: Fantasizing or having phone sex Touching your own body erotically (masturbation) or having each partner touch his or her own body (mutual masturbation) Caressing your partner using nonsexual massage Rubbing against your partner's body with clothes on Kissing Safer sexual intercourse carries some risk, but it is much, much safer than taking no precautions at all. In short, safe sex means not allowing your partner's semen or vaginal secretions to get inside of your vagina, anus, penis, or mouth. Safe sex also means taking precautions if you have cuts, sores, or bleeding gums; these can increase the risk of spreading HIV. Safe sex is protected sex during each and every sexual encounter. It includes: Oral sex with a condom, dental dam, or plastic wrap Vaginal sex with a male or female condom Anal sex with a male or female condom You might think you don't need to practice safe sex if both you and your partner have HIV. The guidelines below will help partners with HIV, as well as uninfected partners who want to avoid getting HIV or an STI. If your partner refuses to use a male condom, you can use a female condom, which fits inside the vagina. Always use a new barrier each and every time you have sex. If you are allergic to latex, you can use a polyurethane condom with an oil-based lubricant. During oral sex, cover the entire genital or anal area with a barrier. You can use a \"dental dam\" (latex squares, which are available in medical supply stores or adult shops) or a large piece of plastic wrap. If you and your partner are HIV positive, use latex surgical gloves when exploring each other sexually. Small cuts on the hand could get infected with HIV, or spread HIV. You can also ask your doctor about the HIV drug Truvada. It has been approved for use in those at high risk as a way to prevent HIV infection."], [764, "Saw Palmetto", "Saw palmetto is a type of palm tree that grows in the southeastern United States. The berry of the saw palmetto plant contains a compound that may reduce the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is a noncancerous enlargement of the prostate gland. Symptoms of an enlarged prostate include dribbling after urination and getting up many times during the night to urinate. From the 1870s until 1950, saw palmetto was a common treatment for prostate and other urinary problems. After 1950, saw palmetto was no longer recognized as a drug in the United States. In the United States, saw palmetto is available as a dietary supplement. Experts disagree on whether saw palmetto improves men's symptoms of BPH. Experts also don't clearly understand how saw palmetto may improve symptoms of BPH. People use saw palmetto to treat the symptoms of an enlarged prostate (BPH). Most studies show that taking saw palmetto doesn't help symptoms of BPH any more than taking a placebo.1 A review of studies done on saw palmetto showed that men who took saw palmetto had some improvement in nighttime urination. But when only the best studies were included in the review, men who took saw palmetto had no difference in symptoms, urine flow, or nighttime urination compared with men who took a placebo.2 In another study, men who took even higher doses of saw palmetto had no difference in BPH symptoms, urine flow, or nighttime urination compared with men who took a placebo.3 Few problems have been reported among men taking saw palmetto. Prostate cancer is treatable, but treatment is most successful when you find and treat the cancer as early as possible. If you intend to use saw palmetto to treat symptoms of BPH, look for a product that has a fat-soluble extract of the saw palmetto berry. So drinking a tea or water extract made from saw palmetto berries is not likely to have an effect on the symptoms of BPH. When using dietary supplements, keep in mind the following: Like conventional medicines, dietary supplements may cause side effects, trigger allergic reactions, or interact with prescription and nonprescription medicines or other supplements you might be taking. This means that how well they work or any side effects they cause may differ among brands or even within different lots of the same brand."], [765, "SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)", "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a respiratory illness that first infected people in parts of Asia, North America, and Europe in late 2002 and early 2003. SARS is caused by a type of coronavirus, which can cause mild to moderate upper respiratory illness, such as the common cold. Experts believe SARS may have first developed in animals because the virus has been found in civets-a catlike wild animal that is eaten as a delicacy in China-and other animals.1 In the first outbreak 8,096 people became sick with SARS and 774 died.2 Like most respiratory illnesses, SARS is spread mainly through contact with infected saliva or droplets from coughing. You cannot get SARS from brief, casual exposure to an infected person, such as passing someone on the street. Close contact includes living with or caring for a person who has SARS or breathing in air that an infected person exhaled. But under some conditions, SARS has spread within an apartment building and to health care workers. An infection may develop after: Sharing food or drink with an infected person. Getting the tiny droplets on your hands by touching contaminated surfaces or objects and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. It is possible SARS can be transmitted in other ways, such as by touching objects that are contaminated with feces from an infected person. The disease does not appear to spread from a mother to her baby at birth.1 The main symptoms are a fever, a dry cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing. A person with SARS also may experience a headache, muscle aches, a sore throat, fatigue, and diarrhea. An older person may feel generally unwell (malaise) and lose his or her appetite but not have a fever.1 For some people the symptoms get worse quickly, making a hospital stay necessary. The incubation period-the time from when a person is first exposed to SARS until symptoms appear-is usually 3 to 7 days but may be as long as 10 days. As a precaution, though, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people who have SARS stay home, except for doctor visits, until 10 days after their symptoms have gone away. If you think you may have SARS, be sure to call your doctor before you go in to get checked. Your doctor may suspect SARS if you have a fever and you either have traveled to a SARS-affected area or have in the past 10 days been around a person who has SARS. Your doctor may suspect that you have SARS if tests rule out any other cause for your symptoms, especially if you had contact with someone who has SARS or you traveled to an area experiencing a SARS outbreak. In this case, blood tests may be done to detect substances in your blood (antibodies) that form to fight the SARS virus. You also may have tests to detect the genetic material (RNA) of the SARS virus. One early study showed that the antiviral medicine interferon alfacon-1, taken along with corticosteroids, may help in the treatment of SARS by increasing the amount of oxygen in the blood.3 About one-third (33 out of 100) of the people with SARS become ill and then recover.4 The illness gets worse in two-thirds (67 out of 100) of the people and is likely to lead to hospitalization. That means about 1 out of 10 people infected with SARS dies.5, 6 The risk of dying from SARS depends on a person's age and health. The greatest risk is to people older than 65 and those with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and heart disease. The best way to prevent the spread of SARS is to avoid areas where there is an outbreak and avoid contact with people who may be infected. The CDC does not recommend wearing face masks in public to prevent infection, although this is a common practice in Asian countries such as Japan."], [766, "Sarcoma, soft tissue, adult: Treatment...", "Sarcomas are different from the much more common carcinomas because they happen in a different kind of tissue. Sarcomas grow in connective tissue -- cells that connect or support other kinds of tissue in your body. These tumors are most common in the bones, muscles, tendons, cartilage, nerves, fat, and blood vessels of your arms and legs, but they can also happen in other areas of your body.. Although there are more than 50 types of sarcoma, they can be grouped into two main kinds: soft tissue sarcoma and bone sarcoma, or osteosarcoma. About 12,000 cases of soft tissue sarcoma and 1,000 new cases of bone sarcomas will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2017. We don't yet know what causes sarcoma, but we do know some things that raise the risk of developing one: Other people in your family have had sarcoma You have a bone disorder called Paget's disease You have a genetic disorder such as neurofibromatosis, Gardner syndrome, retinoblastoma, or Li-Fraumeni syndrome You're been exposed to radiation, perhaps during treatment for an earlier cancer Soft tissue sarcomas are hard to spot, because they can grow anywhere in your body. Osteosarcoma can show obvious early symptoms, including: Pain off and on in the affected bone, which may be worse at night Swelling, which often starts weeks after the pain A limp, if the sarcoma is in your leg Children and young adults get osteosarcoma more often than adults. And because healthy, active children and teens often have pain and swelling in their arms and legs, osteosarcoma might be mistaken for growing pains or a sports injury. If your child's pain doesn't get better, gets worse at night, and is in one arm or leg rather than both, talk to a doctor. If your doctor thinks you may have a sarcoma, you'll probably need a full exam and tests, including: A sample of cells from the tumor, called a biopsy Imaging tests, such as a CT scan, an ultrasound, or an MRI, to help see inside your body A bone scan, if you might have osteosarcoma How your sarcoma is treated depends on what type you have, where in your body it is, how developed it is, and whether or not it has spread to other parts of your body, or metastasized. In most cases of osteosarcoma, the doctor can remove just the cancer cells, and you won't need your arm or leg removed, too. Radiation can shrink the tumor before surgery or kill cancer cells that are left after surgery. Targeted therapies are newer treatments that use drugs or manmade versions of antibodies from the immune system to block the growth of cancer cells while leaving normal cells undamaged. Most people diagnosed with a soft tissue sarcoma are cured by surgery alone, if the tumor is low-grade; that means it is not likely to spread to other parts of the body."], [767, "Schizophrenia Schizophrenia: An Overview", "Schizophrenia is a serious brain disorder that distorts the way a person thinks, acts, expresses emotions, perceives reality, and relates to others. People with schizophrenia -- the most chronic and disabling of the major mental illnesses -- often have problems functioning in society, at work, at school, and in relationships. Schizophrenia is a psychosis, a type of mental illness in which a person cannot tell what is real from what is imagined. The behavior of people with schizophrenia may be very strange and even shocking. A sudden change in personality and behavior, which occurs when schizophrenia sufferers lose touch with reality, is called a psychotic episode. At one time, doctors classified schizophrenia based on distinct subtypes: Paranoid: Where someone feels he is being persecuted or spied on. Undifferentiated schizophrenia: Asubtype in which no paranoid, disorganized or catatonic features are prominent Residual Schizophrenia: In which psychotic symptoms are markedly diminished or no longer present Scientists think the above distinctions are no longer as accurate or useful as once thought and therefore instead just focus on describing symptoms and their severity. People with schizophrenia may have a number of symptoms involving changes in functioning, thinking, perception, behavior, and personality, and they may display different kinds of behavior at different times. The most common symptoms of schizophrenia can be grouped into several categories including positive symptoms, cognitive symptoms, and negative symptoms. Rather, it refers to obvious symptoms that are exaggerated forms of thinking or behavior that become irrational. These symptoms, which are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms, include: Delusions: Delusions are strange beliefs that are not based in reality and that the person refuses to give up, even when presented with factual information. For example, the person suffering from delusions may believe that people can hear his or her thoughts, that he or she is God or the devil, or that people are putting thoughts into his or her head or plotting against them. Hallucinations: These involve perceiving sensations that aren't real, such as seeing things that aren't there, hearing voices, smelling strange odors, having a \"funny\" taste in your mouth, and feeling sensations on your skin even though nothing is touching your body. Disorganized symptoms of schizophrenia are a type of positive symptom that reflects the person's inability to think clearly and respond appropriately. Examples of disorganized symptoms include: Talking in sentences that do not make sense or using nonsense words, making it difficult for the person to communicate or engage in conversation Shifting quickly from one thought to the next Moving slowly Being unable to make decisions Writing excessively but without meaning Forgetting or losing things Repeating movements or gestures, such as pacing or walking in circles Having problems making sense of everyday sights, sounds, and feelings Cognitive symptoms include: Poor executive functioning (the ability to understand information and to use it to make decisions) Trouble focusing or paying attention Difficulty with working memory (the ability to use information immediately after learning it) In this case, the word negative does not mean \"bad,\" but reflects the absence of certain normal behaviors in people with schizophrenia. Negative symptoms of schizophrenia include: Lack of emotion or a very limited range of emotions Withdrawal from family, friends, and social activities Reduced energy Reduced speech Lack of motivation Loss of pleasure or interest in life Poor hygiene and grooming habits The exact cause of schizophrenia is not yet known. Researchers have uncovered a number of factors that appear to play a role in the development of schizophrenia, including: Genetics (heredity): Schizophrenia can run in families, which means a greater likelihood to develop schizophrenia may be passed on from parents to their children. Brain chemistry and circuits: People with schizophrenia may have abnormal regulation of certain chemicals (neurotransmitters) in the brain, related to specific pathways or \"circuits\" of nerve cells that affect thinking and behavior. Scientists think that problems with how these circuits operate may result from trouble with certain receptors on nerve cells for key neurotransmitters (like glutamate, GABA, or dopamine), or with other cells in the nervous system (called \"glia\") that provide support to nerve cells within brain circuits. Brain abnormality: Research has found abnormal brain structure and function in people with schizophrenia. However, this type of abnormality doesn't happen in all schizophrenics and can occur in people without the disease. Environmental factors: Evidence suggests that certain environmental factors, such as a viral infection, extensive exposure to toxins like marijuana, or highly stressful situations, may trigger schizophrenia in people who have inherited a tendency to develop the disorder. Schizophrenia more often surfaces when the body is undergoing hormonal and physical changes, such as those that occur during the teen and young adult years. The disorder affects men and women equally, although symptoms generally appear earlier in men (in their teens or 20s) than in women (in their 20s or early 30s). While there are no laboratory tests to specifically diagnose schizophrenia, the doctor may use various tests, and possibly blood tests or brain imaging studies, to rule out another physical illness or intoxication (substance-induced psychosis) as the cause of the symptoms. If the doctor finds no other physical reason for the schizophrenia symptoms, he or she may refer the person to a psychiatrist or psychologist, mental health professionals who are specially trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses. The therapist bases his or her diagnosis on the person's and family's report of symptoms and his or her observation of the person's attitude and behavior. A person is considered to have schizophrenia if he or she has characteristic symptoms that last for at least six months. The goal of schizophrenia treatment is to reduce the symptoms and to decrease the chances of a relapse, or return of symptoms. Treatment for schizophrenia may include: Medications: The primary medications used to treat schizophrenia are called antipsychotics. These drugs do not cure schizophrenia but help relieve the most troubling symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, and thinking problems. Older (commonly referred to as \"first generation\") antipsychotic medications used include: chlorpromazine (Thorazine), fluphenazine (Prolixin), haloperidol (Haldol), loxapine (Loxapine), perphenazine (Trilafon), thioridazine (Mellaril), thiothixene (Navane), and trifluoperazine (Stelazine). Newer (\"atypical\" or second generation) drugs used to treat schizophrenia include: aripiprazole (Abilify), aripiprazole lauroxil (Aristada), asenapine (Saphris), clozapine (Clozaril), iloperidone (Fanapt), lurasidone (Latuda), paliperidone (Invega Sustenna), paliperidone palmitate (Invega Trinza), quetiapine (Seroquel), risperidone (Risperdal), and olanzapine (Zyprexa), and ziprasidone (Geodon). Psychosocial therapy: While medication may help relieve symptoms of schizophrenia, various psychosocial treatments can help with the behavioral, psychological, social, and occupational problems associated with the illness. Psychosocial therapies include: Rehabilitation, which focuses on social skills and job training to help people with schizophrenia function in the community and live as independently as possible.Cognitive remediation involves learning techniques to compensate for problems with information processing, often through drills, coaching and computer-based exercises, to strengthen specific mental skills involving attention, memory and planning/organization.Individual psychotherapy, which can help the person better understand his or her illness, and learn coping and problem-solving skills.Family therapy, which can help families deal more effectively with a loved one who has schizophrenia, enabling them to better help their loved one.Group therapy/support groups, which can provide continuing mutual support.

Cognitive remediation involves learning techniques to compensate for problems with information processing, often through drills, coaching and computer-based exercises, to strengthen specific mental skills involving attention, memory and planning/organization. Individual psychotherapy, which can help the person better understand his or her illness, and learn coping and problem-solving skills. Hospitalization: Many people with schizophrenia may be treated as outpatients. However, people with particularly severe symptoms, or those in danger of hurting themselves or others or who cannot take care of themselves at home may require hospitalization to stabilize their condition. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): This is a procedure in which electrodes are attached to the person's scalp and, while asleep under general anesthesia, a small electric shock is delivered to the brain. Scientists do not fully understand exactly how ECT and the controlled seizures it causes have a therapeutic effect, although some researcher think that ECT-induced seizures may affect the release of neurotransmitters in the brain. ECT is less well established for treating schizophrenia than depression or bipolar disorder, and it is therefore not used very often when mood symptoms are absent. Psychosurgery: In the 1940s and 1950s, a neurosurgical procedure called a prefrontal lobotomy was sometimes used to treat severe agitation associated with psychosis. Because it caused serious and irreversible negative effects that dulled personality and motivation, the procedure is no longer performed as a psychiatric treatment. Other, more modern neurosurgical procedures being studied to treat schizophrenia include deep brain stimulation (DBS) -- an entirely different operation that is not at all related to lobotomy -- in which stimulating electrodes are surgically implanted in brain areas believed to control thinking and perception. In some cases, however, people with mental illness may engage in dangerous or violent behaviors that are generally a result of their psychosis and the resulting fear from feelings of being threatened in some way by their surroundings. Depending on the level of severity and the consistency of treatment received they are able to live with their families or in community settings rather than in long-term psychiatric institutions."], [768, "Sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, childhood: T...", "This is a rare form of cancer that mainly happens in childhood. Doctors don't know any way to prevent Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), but there are treatments. The name rhabdomyosarcoma comes from the type of cells this cancer usually forms in called rhabdomyoblasts. Later, they turn into tissues that make up the skeletal muscles -- the muscles you use to move your body. Because rhabdomyoblasts are mainly found in developing embryos, the cancer is usually diagnosed in children. There are three main types of RMS: Embryonal RMS is the most common. Doctors don't know of any lifestyle habits or things in the environment that raise the risk of having or passing on RMS. If you have a child with RMS, the disease wasn't caused by something you did or didn't do. Symptoms depend on where in the body the tumor is: Tumors in the muscles behind the eye can cause eye bulging, vision problems, and cross-eyes. Tumors in the ear or nasal cavity can cause earaches, headaches, congestion, or nosebleeds. Tumors that form in the urinary tract can make it hard to urinate or cause blood in a child's urine. Tumors in the neck, chest, arms, legs, back, or groin can cause lumps or swelling. But if your child has one of these symptoms that can't be explained -- like a bump that doesn't go away or gets bigger -- you should get it checked by a doctor. If a doctor thinks a child's symptoms may be caused by cancer, she'll order tests that show pictures of inside the body: X-rays: Doctors use electromagnetic waves to make images of your child's tissue. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): Powerful magnets and radio waves make detailed images. CT scan (computerized tomography): Several X-rays taken from different angles are put together to show more information. Ultrasound: Sound waves are used to make images of the body. Bone scan: Radioactive material is put into a vein to show areas where there may be cancer. If these tests show that your child has a tumor, a surgeon will do a biopsy of the area. He'll make a small cut or use a needle to collect a tiny sample of cells. Your child may also have chemotherapy to kill cancer cells that may be missed during surgery. Most of these side effects are temporary, and children tend to handle chemotherapy better than adults. If tests show that part of a tumor is still in the body after surgery and chemotherapy, your child may have radiation to try to shrink or destroy it. Radiation uses powerful X-rays to kill cancer cells. Discuss these risks with your child's doctor before radiation begins. If the tumor is in a hard-to-reach spot or it overlaps with important organs, it's more difficult for doctors to take out all the cancer cells without damaging healthy tissue. If this is the case, your child's treatment may not start with surgery. If surgery seems too difficult or risky, your child may have chemotherapy or radiation first to try to shrink the tumor. If it's caught early and hasn't spread to other parts of your child's body, doctors can usually get rid of the cancer. That's why children treated for RMS need to have regular follow-up appointments with their doctors for several years. These checkups can include physical exams, blood tests, and imaging scans to check for signs that their disease has returned."], [769, "Sarcoidosis", "In people with sarcoidosis, abnormal masses or nodules (called granulomas) consisting of inflamed tissues form in certain organs of the body. These granulomas may alter the normal structure and possibly the function of the affected organ(s). The symptoms of sarcoidosis can vary greatly, depending on which organs are involved. Most patients initially complain of a persistent dry cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Other symptoms may include: Tender reddish bumps or patches on the skin. Development of abnormal or missed heart beats (arrhythmias), inflammation of the covering of the heart (pericarditis), or heart failure. In some people, symptoms may begin suddenly and/or severely and subside in a short period of time. Others may have no outward symptoms at all even though organs are affected. People of Scandinavian, German, Irish, or Puerto Rican origin are also more prone to the disease. There is no single way to diagnose sarcoidosis, since all the symptoms and laboratory results can occur in other diseases. For this reason, your doctor will carefully review your medical history and examine you to determine if you have sarcoidosis. The main tools your doctor will use to diagnose sarcoidosis include: Chest X-rays to look for cloudiness (pulmonary infiltrates) or swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy). HRCT scan (high resolution CT) to provide an even more detailed look at the lungs and lymph nodes than provided by a chest X-ray. Pulmonary function (breathing) tests to measure how well the lungs are working. Bronchoscopy to inspect the bronchial tubes and to extract a biopsy (a small tissue sample) to look for granulomas and to obtain material to rule out infection. Bronchoscopy involves passing a small tube (bronchoscope) down the trachea (windpipe) and into the bronchial tubes (airways) of the lungs. Many people with sarcoidosis have mild symptoms and do not require any treatment. Treatment, when it is needed, is given to reduce symptoms and to maintain the proper working order of the affected organs. Treatments generally fall into two categories -- maintenance of good health practices and drug treatment. Good health practices include: Getting regular check-ups with your health care provider Eating a well-balanced diet with a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables Drinking enough fluids every day Getting six to eight hours of sleep each night Exercising regularly and managing your weight Quitting smoking Drug treatments are used to relieve symptoms and reduce the inflammation of the affected tissues. If steroids are prescribed, you should see your doctor at regular intervals so that he or she can monitor the disease and the side effects of treatment. Other treatment options include methotrexate(Otrexup, Rheumatrex), hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), and other drugs. In some people, the disease may result in the deterioration of the affected organ. Death usually is the result of complications with the lungs, heart, or brain."], [770, "Sarcoid of Boeck", "Sarcoidosis is characterized by the abnormal formation of inflammatory masses or nodules (granulomas) consisting of certain granular white blood cells (modified macrophages or epithelioid cells) in certain organs of the body. The granulomas that are formed are thought to alter the normal structure of and, potentially, the normal functions of, the affected organ(s), causing symptoms associated with the particular body system(s) in question. However, in many cases, the upper respiratory system, lymph nodes, skin, and/or eyes may be involved. In addition, in some cases, other organs may be affected, including the liver, bone marrow, spleen, musculoskeletal system, heart, salivary glands, and/or nervous system (i.e., central or peripheral nervous system). In some cases, the symptoms of sarcoidosis may begin suddenly (acute), sometimes severely, and subside in a relatively short period of time (self limited). Acute sarcoidosis is often characterized by fatigue, fever, generalized muscle aches, difficulty breathing (dyspnea), joint pain, swollen glands, skin eruptions, eye irregularities, and/or other symptoms. In the chronic form of sarcoidosis, symptoms may appear slowly and subtly, and may persist or recur over a long time span.

They may then begin to exhibit a delay in the acquisition of skills that require the coordination of mental and muscular activity (psychomotor retardation). In addition, affected infants begin to lose previously acquired physical and mental abilities (developmental regression). Affected infants may then experience a variety of symptoms including episodes of uncontrolled electrical disturbances in the brain (seizures), impaired ability to coordinate voluntary movements (cerebellar ataxia), abnormally diminished muscle tone (hypotonia), and repeated, brief, shock-like muscle spasms of the arms, legs, or entire body (myoclonic seizures). Affected infants also experience progressive visual impairment due to deterioration of the nerves of the eyes (optic nerves) that transmit impulses from the nerve-rich membranes lining the eyes (retina) to the brain (optic atrophy).

The disease usually occurs in people ages 40 to 60, but anyone can have it. The cause of Meniere's disease is not known. But it may be related to a fluid called endolymph in the inner ear. In people with Meniere's disease, too much of this fluid builds up. This creates pressure in the parts of your inner ear that control balance. It may be that your body produces too much of the fluid. Or maybe the fluid doesn't drain as it should from the inner ear. It's hard to predict who will get Meniere's disease. Had a head injury, especially if it involved your ear. Had a viral infection of the inner ear. Meniere's disease can cause symptoms that come on quickly and last from hours to days. During an attack, you may have: Vertigo, the feeling that you or your surroundings are spinning. Tinnitus, a low roaring, ringing, or hissing in your ear. In some cases, each attack damages the inner ear. Then the attacks may stop, but you may be left with: Poor balance. A few people with Meniere's disease have \"drop attacks.\" It may feel like you are suddenly being pushed to the ground. See a doctor right away if you think you have Meniere's disease. Prompt diagnosis and treatment may reduce both the discomfort of the attacks and your risk of hearing loss. To diagnose the disease, your doctor will do a physical exam that includes checking your ears, eyes, and nervous system. The doctor will also ask questions about your past health and your symptoms, such as: How you feel when you have a vertigo attack. Your doctor may also do tests to confirm a diagnosis of Meniere's. These tests may include: A Dix-Hallpike test to find out if certain head movements trigger vertigo. Hearing tests, including one to find out if the nerve from the inner ear to the brain is working as it should. A test called an electronystagmogram (ENG), which measures your eye movements. This can help the doctor find where the problem is that's causing vertigo. These tests can find out if the symptoms are caused by a brain problem. Meniere's disease can't be cured. But your doctor can prescribe treatment to help control your symptoms and reduce how often you have attacks. Diuretics help rid your body of excess fluid, so they may help prevent the buildup of fluid in your inner ear. Your doctor may also prescribe medicines to use when you have an attack, such as: Medicines that reduce the vertigo. These include antihistamines such as dimenhydrinate (for example, Dramamine), sedatives such as diazepam (for example, Valium), and the scopolamine patch (Transderm Scop). If symptoms are severe and don't respond to medicine, your doctor may suggest another treatment, such as surgery to reduce the fluid or pressure in the inner ear. The goal is to get rid of your symptoms while saving as much of your hearing as possible. In rare cases of severe, lasting Meniere's disease, doctors may suggest a treatment to destroy the balance center in the inner ear (labyrinth), which can prevent vertigo. During this procedure, an antibiotic (usually gentamicin) is injected into the inner ear to destroy the labyrinth. These treatments can cause permanent hearing loss, so they are usually done only as a last resort. Meniere's can be hard to manage and tough to live with. But there are some things you can do that may help reduce the number of attacks you have: Eat low-salt foods. If you eat less salt, you may have less buildup of fluid in the ear.

You can also reduce the risk of transmitting an STI to your sex partner. Delay sexual activity until you are prepared both physically and emotionally to have sex. Sexually active teenagers are at high risk for STIs because they frequently have unprotected sex and have multiple partners. Biological changes during the teen years also may increase their risk for getting an STI. It is important to practice safer sex with all partners, especially if you or they may have high-risk sexual behaviors. It is especially important that pregnant women who are at risk for STIs practice safer sex because an STI can affect their baby (fetus). An STI may threaten the life of your baby or cause serious long-term problems or disabilities for your baby. Preventing a sexually transmitted infection (STI) is easier than treating an infection after it occurs. Talk with your partner about STIs before beginning a sexual relationship. Remember that it is quite possible to be infected with an STI without knowing it. How many sex partners has he or she had?What high-risk behaviors does he or she have?Has he or she ever had an STI?Was it treated and cured?If the STI is not curable, what is the best way to protect yourself? Avoid sexual contact or activity if you have symptoms of an STI or are being treated for an STI.Avoid sexual contact or activity with anyone who has symptoms of an STI or who may have been exposed to an STI. Avoid sexual contact or activity if you have symptoms of an STI or are being treated for an STI. Avoid sexual contact or activity with anyone who has symptoms of an STI or who may have been exposed to an STI. Your risk of an STI increases if you have several sex partners at the same time. Some STIs can also be spread through oral-to-genital or genital-to-anal sexual contact. Abstain from sexual intercourse to prevent any exposure to STIs. Condoms can protect you against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Even if you are protected against pregnancy by birth control pills or another method, use a condom to prevent STIs. Using condoms reduces the risk of becoming infected with most STIs, especially if the condoms are used correctly and consistently. Condoms must be put on before beginning any sexual contact or activity. Use condoms with a new partner until you are certain he or she does not have an STI. Use a water-based lubricant such as K-Y Jelly to help prevent tearing of the skin if there is a lack of lubrication with condom use during sexual intercourse. Small tears in the vagina during vaginal sex or in the rectum during anal sex allow STIs to get into your blood. Even if you are using another birth control method to prevent pregnancy, you may wish to use condoms to reduce your risk of getting an STI. Female condoms are available for women whose partners do not have or will not use a male condom. Condoms do not prevent skin-to-sore contact in the genital area, so it is possible to spread an STI with genital contact. Mouth barriers, such as a dental dam, can be used to reduce the spread of infection through oral sexual activity. Avoid douching if you are a woman, because it can change the normal balance of organisms in the vagina and increases the risk of getting an STI. This may increase the risk of getting HIV from an infected partner."], [779, "Safe Food Handling", "You can also see the topics E. Coli Infection and Toxoplasmosis During Pregnancy. These harmful germs can include bacteria, parasites, and viruses. They are mostly found in raw meat, chicken, fish, and eggs, but they can spread to any type of food. They can also grow on food that is left out on counters or outdoors or is stored too long before you eat it. Most of the time, food poisoning is mild and goes away after a few days. All you can do is wait for your body to get rid of the germ that is causing the illness. But some types of food poisoning may be more serious, and you may need to see a doctor. You may also feel sick to your stomach, vomit, or have stomach cramps. Some food poisoning can cause a high fever and blood in your stool. How you feel when you have food poisoning mostly depends on how healthy you are and what germ is making you sick. If you vomit or have diarrhea a lot, you can get dehydrated. Germs can get into food when: Meat is processed. It is normal to find bacteria in the intestines of healthy animals that we use for food. Sometimes the bacteria get mixed up with the parts of those animals that we eat. The food is watered or washed. If the water used to irrigate or wash fresh fruits and vegetables has germs from animal manure or human sewage in it, those germs can get on the fruits and vegetables. When someone who has germs on his or her hands touches the food, or if the food touches other food that has germs on it, the germs can spread. For example, if you use the same cutting board for chopping vegetables and preparing raw meat, germs from the raw meat can get on the vegetables. Because most food poisoning is mild and goes away after a few days, most people don't go to the doctor. If you think you have food poisoning, call your local health department to report it. This could help keep others from getting sick. You may need to see your doctor if your diarrhea or vomiting is very bad or if you don't start to get better after a few days. If you do go to the doctor, he or she will ask you about your symptoms (diarrhea, feeling sick to your stomach, or throwing up), ask about your health in general, and do a physical exam. Sometimes the doctor will take stool or blood samples and have them tested. In most cases, food poisoning goes away on its own in 2 to 3 days. All you need to do is rest and get plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration from diarrhea. Drink a cup of water or rehydration drink (such as Pedialyte) each time you have a large, loose stool. Soda and fruit juices have too much sugar and shouldn't be used to rehydrate. Antibiotics usually aren't used to treat food poisoning. Medicines that stop diarrhea (antidiarrheals) can be helpful, but they should not be given to infants or young children. You shouldn't take antidiarrheals if you have a high fever or have blood in the diarrhea, because they can make your illness worse. If you think you are severely dehydrated, you may need to go to the hospital. Wash your hands often and always before you touch food. Keep your knives, cutting boards, and counters clean. You can wash them with hot, soapy water, or put items in the dishwasher and use a disinfectant on your counter. Wash fresh fruits and vegetables. Keep germs from raw meat from getting on fruits, vegetables, and other foods. Put cooked meat on a clean platter, not back on the one that held the raw meat.

In a small number of people, some of the notochord cells are left behind in the spine and skull.

If you're working or standing barefoot in soil that's infected with the fungus that causes ringworm, you can get it, too. You'll have to see your doctor to be sure if the infection is ringworm. Your doctor will probably scrape some skin from the itchy, scaly areas and look at them under a microscope. How the infection is treated depends on where it is and how bad it is. In many cases, your doctor may recommend an over-the-counter (OTC) medicine you can get at the drugstore. If the ringworm is on your skin, an OTC antifungal cream, lotion, or powder may work just fine. Some of the most popular ones are clotrimazole (Lotrimin, Mycelex) and miconazole. In most cases, you'll have to use the medicines on your skin for 2 to 4 weeks to make sure you kill the fungus that causes ringworm. If you have ringworm on your scalp or in many different places on your body, OTC treatments probably won't be enough. Keep an eye out for symptoms that get worse or don't clear up after 2 weeks. If they don't, call your doctor. The fungi that cause it are everywhere. Still, here are some things you can do to lower your chances of getting ringworm or stop it from spreading: Keep your skin clean and dry. If you play sports, keep your gear and uniform clean -- and don't share them with other players. If your pets have ringworm, see your vet."], [786, "Salmonellosis", "It's summer, and like many people, maybe you want to celebrate with a picnic. But when you get up the next morning, you feel sick to your stomach and have diarrhea. But most people know it by the name salmonella, which is actually the name of the bacteria that causes the infection. Along with having the runs when you go to the bathroom, you can also have a fever, along with pain and cramping in your stomach. Most people who get salmonella get better on their own, at home, within 4 to 7 days. They include: Poultry (chicken, turkey, or duck) Beef and veal Pork Fertilizer. The most common way to get salmonella is by eating meat or eggs or drinking milk that's contaminated. But you can also get it by eating fruits or vegetables that have been in contact with manure from animals that have it. Animal poop is often used in fertilizer for fruits and vegetables, which is how produce such as lettuce, spinach, or strawberries can also be a source of salmonella in people. While animal poop is still the culprit, it's not because of manure being put directly on the fields, but contaminated water used to help the produce grow. If you cook a lot at home, the way you prepare your food could also be a source of your infection. If you let juices from contaminated chicken or steak come into contact with your lettuce or spinach salad, you could get sick. If you go to the bathroom but don't wash your hands well, you could get an infection. If you change your baby's stinky diaper and forget to wash your hands after, you might contract a salmonella infection, too. Some that may carry the bacteria include: Dogs Cats Birds Reptiles (such as lizards, snakes, and turtles) You or your child could pet a dog or cat and, without knowing it, touch poop hidden in fur. If you then put your fingers in your mouth, you could get an infection. Salmonella infections (also often referred to, generally, as food poisoning) are quite common. Most people get over it without treatment, but some cases are so severe people need to go to the hospital. Infections are more common in the summer than the winter - after all, people host more picnics when it's hot than cold. Most of the symptoms you'll have from a salmonella infection will be stomach-related: Cramps in your stomach Bloody stools Diarrhea Cold and chills Fever Headache Sick to your stomach Throwing up Even though most symptoms usually don't last more than a week, in some cases it can take several months for your bowel movements to get back to normal. A small number of people who get a salmonella infection get pain in their joints. If you get this joint pain, you also could develop pain while peeing or your eyes could get sore, get itchy, or sting. Signs of dehydration include: Peeing only in small amounts Dry tongue and mouth Sunken and dry eyes If the salmonella infection gets into your blood, it can infect your body's tissues, such as: The tissues around your brain and spinal cord The lining of your heart or heart valves Your bones or bone marrow The lining of blood vessels These infections can lead to serious diseases. But if you still are having symptoms more than a week after first getting the infection, you might want to see a doctor. If a young child, older adult, or person with a weakened immune system has an infection, they should see a doctor if they have any of these symptoms for more than a couple of days: Bloody stools Dehydration Ongoing high fever. Diagnosis and Tests Your doctor may want you to have blood tests, or he might want a stool sample. This can help health officials trace the source if there is an outbreak in your area. For healthy adults: If you have diarrhea with your salmonella infection, you should drink a lot of water and other fluids. If your doctor confirms that you have a salmonella infection, he might prescribe antibiotics. You need to be sure you finish the prescription and take it exactly as directed. For children: If your child has a healthy immune system, the doctor may not prescribe any treatment, but rather let the infection run its course. In special cases: Infants, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems may need antibiotics. Even though salmonella can hide in a variety of foods, you can do a lot of things yourself to help ensure the sneaky bacteria doesn't invade your gut: Avoid eating raw or barely cooked eggs."], [787, "Ringed Eruption", "Granuloma annulare is a chronic degenerative skin disorder.

Stop, change, or take a break from any activity that may be causing your pain or soreness. Apply an ice or cold pack right away to prevent or minimize swelling. Apply the ice or cold pack for 10 to 20 minutes, 3 or more times a day. After 48 to 72 hours, if swelling is gone, apply heat to the area that hurts. Compression, or wrapping the injured or sore area with an elastic bandage (such as an Ace wrap), will help decrease swelling. Don't wrap it too tightly, because this can cause more swelling below the affected area. Signs that the bandage is too tight include numbness, tingling, increased pain, coolness, or swelling in the area below the bandage. Elevate the injured or sore area on pillows while applying ice and anytime you are sitting or lying down. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may also help relieve your pain and swelling. They include: Ibuprofen, such as Advil or Motrin. Naproxen, such as Aleve or Naprosyn.

The inflammation causes blood vessels in the skin, intestines, kidneys, and joints to start leaking. Although HSP can affect people at any age, most cases occur in children between the ages of 2 and 11. Adults with HSP are more likely to have more severe disease compared to children. HSP usually ends after four to six weeks -- sometimes with recurrence of symptoms over this period, but with no long-term consequences. Some cases of HSP have been linked to vaccinations for typhoid, cholera, yellow fever, measles, or hepatitis B; foods, drugs, chemicals, and insect bites. Some experts also say that HSP is associated with the colder weather of fall and winter. The classic symptoms of HSP are rash, joint pain and swelling, abdominal pain, and/or related kidney disease, including blood in urine. Before these symptoms begin, patients may have two to three weeks of fever, headache, and muscular aches and pains. The initial appearance may resemble hives, with small red spots or bumps on the lower legs, buttocks, knees, and elbows. Joint inflammation, involving pain and swelling, occurs in approximately three-quarters of cases, particularly affecting the knees and ankles. In more than half of people with HSP, inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract may cause pain or cramping; it may also lead to loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and occasionally blood in the stool. In some cases, patients may have abdominal pain before the rash appears. In rare cases, an abnormal folding of the bowel (intussusception) may cause a bowel blockage, which may require surgery to fix. HSP can cause kidney problems, indicated by such signs as protein or blood in the urine. It's important to monitor the kidney problems closely and make sure they clear up, since about 5% of patients may develop progressive kidney disease. The diagnosis of HSP may be clear when the typical rash, arthritis, and abdominal pain are present. A doctor may order some tests to rule out other diagnoses, confirm the diagnosis, and assess its severity. Occasionally, when the diagnosis is uncertain, particularly if the only symptom is the classic rash, your doctor may perform biopsies of the skin or kidney. Urine and blood tests will likely be done to detect signs of kidney involvement and may need to be repeated during follow-up to monitor any changes in kidney function. The rash and joint pain will usually go away after four to six weeks without causing any permanent damage. Bouts of the rash may recur in approximately one-third of cases, but they are usually milder, do not involve joint and abdominal symptoms, and they clear up on their own."], [793, "Rheumatic Chorea", "Sydenham chorea is a rare neurological disorder characterized by rapid, involuntary, purposeless movements, especially of the face, feet and hands.

PPB occurs almost exclusively in children under the age of approximately 7-8 years and rarely in older children, in teenagers and more rarely in adults. Three subtypes of PPB exist and are called type I, type II, and type III PPB. Type I PPB takes the form of cysts in the lungs (air-filled pockets) and occurs in the youngest children with PPB (from birth to about 2 years of age). Type III PPB is entirely solid tumor. Types II and III PPB tend to occur after age 2 years. If type I PPB comes back, it usually happens within about 4 years of the original diagnosis, and it is usually type II or III when it recurs. Children with type I PPB have a better outlook (\"prognosis\") than children with types II and III PPB; most type I PPB patients are cured (more than 80%). Treatment for type I consists of surgery and possibly chemotherapy; for Types II and III PPB surgery, chemotherapy and possibly radiation therapy is recommended. At present, about 50-60% of types II and III children are cured. PPB occurs in the lungs so PPB can be called a lung cancer, but PPB has no connection whatsoever with lung cancers in adults that are often related to tobacco use. When a cancer spreads to another part of the body it is called a \"metastasis\" of the cancer. PPB family cancer syndrome: In about 25% of children with PPB, there are other childhood cancers or abnormalities in the PPB patient or in their families. This can include lung cysts, kidney cysts, ovarian or testicular tumors in children or young adults, thyroid tumors (sometimes malignant), and various other cancers and non-malignant (non cancerous) diseases. It should be emphasized that many children and adults in these families have no medical problems."], [795, "Rh Sensitization During Pregnancy", "If you are Rh-negative, your red blood cells do not have a marker called Rh factor on them. If your blood mixes with Rh-positive blood, your immune system will react to the Rh factor by making antibodies to destroy it. This immune system response is called Rh sensitization. Rh sensitization can occur during pregnancy if you are Rh-negative and pregnant with a developing baby (fetus) who has Rh-positive blood. But if you get pregnant again with an Rh-positive baby, the antibodies already in your blood could attack the baby's red blood cells. The problems will tend to get worse with each Rh-positive pregnancy you have. Rh sensitization is one reason it's important to see your doctor in the first trimester of pregnancy. It doesn't cause any warning symptoms, and a blood test is the only way to know you have it or are at risk for it. If you are at risk, Rh sensitization can almost always be prevented. If you are already sensitized, treatment can help protect your baby. Rh sensitization during pregnancy can only happen if a woman has Rh-negative blood and only if her baby has Rh-positive blood. If the mother is Rh-negative and the father is Rh-positive, there is a good chance the baby will have Rh-positive blood. If you have Rh-negative blood, your doctor will probably treat you as though the baby's blood is Rh-positive no matter what the father's blood type is, just to be on the safe side. All pregnant women get a blood test at their first prenatal visit during early pregnancy. If you have Rh-negative blood but are not sensitized: The blood test may be repeated between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. If the test still shows that you are not sensitized, you probably will not need another antibody test until delivery. (You might need to have the test again if you have an amniocentesis, if your pregnancy goes beyond 40 weeks, or if you have a problem such as placenta abruptio, which could cause bleeding in the uterus.) If the newborn has Rh-positive blood, you will have an antibody test to see if you were sensitized during late pregnancy or childbirth. You may have: Regular blood tests, to check the level of antibodies in your blood. If you have Rh-negative blood but are not Rh-sensitized, your doctor will give you one or more shots of Rh immune globulin (such as RhoGAM). This prevents Rh sensitization in about 99 women out of 100 who use it.1 You may get a shot of Rh immune globulin: If you have a test such as an amniocentesis. The shots only work for a short time, so you will need to repeat this treatment each time you get pregnant. (To prevent sensitization in future pregnancies, Rh immune globulin is also given when an Rh-negative woman has a miscarriage, abortion, or ectopic pregnancy.) You may also need to see a doctor who specializes in high-risk pregnancies (a perinatologist). If the baby's anemia is mild, you will just have more testing than usual while you are pregnant. If anemia is getting worse, it may be safest to deliver the baby early. For severe anemia, a baby can have a blood transfusion while still in the uterus. You may have an early C-section, and the baby may need to have another blood transfusion right after birth. What medicines are used to prevent Rh sensitization during pregnancy?

If you are looking for information on a herniated disc in the neck, see the topic Cervical Disc Herniation. When these discs are healthy, they act as shock absorbers for the spine and keep the spine flexible. But when a disc is damaged, it may bulge or break open. It may also be called a slipped or ruptured disc. You can have a herniated disc in any part of your spine. But most herniated discs affect the lower back (lumbar spine). A herniated disc may be caused by: Wear and tear of the disc. As you age, your discs dry out and aren't as flexible. This may cause tiny tears or cracks in the hard outer layer of the disc. When this happens, the thick gel inside the disc can be forced out through the tears or cracks in the outer layer of the disc. This causes the disc to bulge or break open. When a herniated disc presses on nerve roots , it can cause pain, numbness, and weakness in the area of the body where the nerve travels. A herniated disc in the lower back can cause pain and numbness in the buttock and down the leg. Sciatica is the most common symptom of a herniated disc in the low back. If a herniated disc isn't pressing on a nerve, you may have a backache or no pain at all. This could be a sign of a rare but serious problem called cauda equina syndrome. Your doctor may diagnose a herniated disc by asking questions about your symptoms and examining you. If your symptoms clearly point to a herniated disc, you may not need tests. Sometimes a doctor will do tests such as an MRI or a CT scan to confirm a herniated disc or rule out other health problems. Symptoms from a herniated disc usually get better in a few weeks or months. Staying in bed for more than 1 or 2 days can weaken your muscles and make the problem worse. Walking and other light activity may help. Try using a heating pad on a low or medium setting for 15 to 20 minutes every 2 or 3 hours. You can also try an ice pack for 10 to 15 minutes every 2 to 3 hours. Do the exercises that your doctor or physical therapist suggests. Ask your doctor about medicine to treat your symptoms. Medicine won't cure a herniated disc, but it may help with pain and swelling. Usually a herniated disc will heal on its own over time. If your symptoms don't get better in a few months, you may want to talk to your doctor about surgery.

If you are pregnant and get infected with the rubella virus, your baby (fetus) could become infected too. This can cause birth defects, including serious defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Rubella also is called German measles or 3-day measles. The rubella virus most often is spread through droplets of fluid from the mouth, nose, or eyes of someone who has the infection. You can get infected by touching something that has the droplets on it and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth before washing your hands. If you have rubella, you are most likely to spread it a few days before the rash starts until 5 to 7 days after the rash first appears. Symptoms of rubella may include: A mild fever. Swollen glands (lymph nodes), especially behind the ear and at the back of the head. A mild rash that starts on the face and spreads to the neck, the chest, and the rest of the body. A blood test can help your doctor find out if a recent infection you've had was caused by the rubella virus. The test also shows if you have been immunized against rubella or are immune to the virus. Stay away from other people, especially pregnant women, as much as you can so that you don't spread the illness. He or she may give you a shot of immunoglobulin (IG) if testing shows that you are not immune. It also lowers the chance of birth defects, although it doesn't always prevent them. The rubella vaccine protects at least 9 out of 10 immunized people from getting this illness.1 In the United States, the vaccine is part of the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) and MMRV (measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella [chickenpox]) vaccines. Outbreaks may occur in people who haven't gotten the vaccine. This is more likely to happen in college, military, health care, and child care settings and among people who have recently moved to the United States from other countries.1 If you are planning to become pregnant and don't know if you're immune to rubella, get a blood test to find out. If you're not immune, you can safely get the rubella vaccine up to 1 month before you become pregnant.

And like a cold, it is very common and very contagious. RSV is usually not something to worry about. But it can lead to pneumonia or other problems in some people, especially babies. Like a cold virus, RSV attacks your nose, eyes, throat, and lungs. It spreads like a cold too, when you cough, sneeze, or share food or drinks. There are many kinds of RSV, so your body never becomes immune to it. You can get it again and again throughout your life, sometimes during the same season. RSV usually causes the same symptoms as a bad cold, such as: A cough. Babies with RSV may also: Have no energy. Act fussy or cranky. Some children have more serious symptoms, like wheezing. Call your doctor if your child is wheezing or having trouble breathing. Doctors usually diagnose RSV by asking about your or your child's symptoms and by knowing whether there is an outbreak of the infection in your area. There are tests for RSV, but they aren't usually needed. Your doctor may want to do testing if you or your child may be likely to have other problems. For most people, home treatment is all that is needed. If your child has RSV: Prop up your child's head to make it easier to breathe and sleep. Suction your baby's nose if he or she can't breathe well enough to eat or sleep. Relieve fever with acetaminophen or ibuprofen, if needed. Never give aspirin to someone younger than 20 years, because it can cause Reye syndrome, a serious but rare problem.

Swings in temperature from hot to cold or cold to hot can also cause a flare-up of rosacea. People with rosacea may have: A flushed, red face with sensitive, dry skin that may burn or sting. In rare cases, rosacea that is not treated may cause permanent effects, such as thickening of the skin on your face or loss of vision. It may cause knobby bumps on the nose, called rhinophyma (say \"ry-no-FY-muh\"). Redness and breakouts can be treated with:Pills, such as low-dose antibiotics like doxycycline.Skin creams that contain medicine, such as azelaic acid, brimonidine, or metronidazole. Skin creams that contain medicine, such as azelaic acid, brimonidine, or metronidazole. Dry, sensitive skin can be protected with products for sensitive skin, such as moisturizers and sunscreen. Dry, red, and irritated eyes can be treated with artificial tears or prescription eyedrops that contain a medicine such as cyclosporine. Thickened or bumpy skin on the nose or face can be treated with cosmetic surgery. One of the most important things is to learn what triggers your flare-ups, and then avoid them. It can help to keep a diary of what you were eating, drinking, and doing on days that the rosacea appeared. When you are outdoors, protect your face by wearing a wide-brimmed hat or visor. Use a sunscreen that is rated SPF 30 or higher every day. If your skin is dry, find a moisturizer with sunscreen. Use skin care products for sensitive skin, and avoid any products that scratch or irritate your skin."], [814, "Romberg Syndrome", "Parry-Romberg syndrome is a rare, acquired disorder characterized by slowly progressive shrinkage (atrophy) of the skin and soft tissues of half of the face (hemifacial atrophy).

People with restless legs syndrome have uncomfortable sensations in their legs (and sometimes arms or other parts of the body) and an irresistible urge to move their legs to relieve the sensations. The condition causes an uncomfortable, \"itchy,\" \"pins and needles,\" or \"creepy crawly\" feeling in the legs. The sensations are usually worse at rest, especially when lying or sitting. The severity of RLS symptoms ranges from mild to intolerable. For some people, symptoms may cause severe nightly sleep disruption that can significantly impair their quality of life. Restless legs syndrome may affect up to 10% of the U.S. population. Once correctly diagnosed, RLS can often be treated successfully. Other factors associated with the development or worsening of restless legs syndrome include: Chronic diseases. Certain chronic diseases and medical conditions, including iron deficiency, Parkinson's disease, kidney failure, diabetes, and peripheral neuropathy often include symptoms of RLS. Some types of medications, including antinausea drugs, antipsychotic drugs, some antidepressants, and cold and allergy medications containing sedating antihistamines, may worsen symptoms. Other factors, including alcohol use and sleep deprivation, may trigger symptoms or make them worse. There is no medical test to diagnose RLS; however, doctors may use blood tests and other exams to rule out other conditions. The diagnosis of RLS is based on a patient's symptoms and answers to questions concerning family history of similar symptoms, medication use, the presence of other symptoms or medical conditions, or problems with daytime sleepiness. In people with mild to moderate restless legs syndrome, lifestyle changes, such as beginning a regular exercise program, establishing regular sleep patterns, and eliminating or decreasing the use of caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco, may be helpful. Other non-drug RLS treatments may include: Leg massages Hot baths or heating pads or ice packs applied to the legs Good sleep habits A vibrating pad called Relaxis Medications may be helpful as RLS treatments, but the same drugs are not helpful for everyone. Drugs used to treat RLS include: Dopaminergic drugs, which act on the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain. Mirapex, Neupro, and Requip are FDA-approved for treatment of moderate to severe RLS.

Although it's a serious disease, finding and treating it early makes it more likely that you'll be cured. No matter when you're diagnosed, you can do certain things to ease your symptoms and feel better during your treatment. It often starts as just one tumor in a kidney, but sometimes it begins as several tumors, or it's found in both kidneys at once. You might also hear it called hypernephroma, renal cell adenocarcinoma, or renal cell cancer. Doctors have different ways to treat renal cell carcinoma, and scientists are testing new ones, too. You'll want to learn as much about your disease as you can and work with your doctor so you can choose the best treatment. Several things can raise your chances of getting the disease, like: Smoking Being very overweight Taking a lot of pain medicine, like aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen, for a long time Exposure to certain dyes, asbestos, cadmium (a metal), herbicides, and solvents Some inherited conditions, especially von Hippel-Lindau disease Early on, renal cell carcinoma doesn't usually cause any symptoms. As the disease gets more serious, you might have warning signs like: A lump on your side, belly, or lower back Blood in your pee Low back pain on one side Losing weight for no clear reason Not feeling hungry Fever Feeling tired Not enough red blood cells (anemia) Night sweats High levels of calcium in your blood High blood pressure Your doctor will want to find out more about your symptoms to figure out what's going on.

You'll have this test if your doctor has already spotted a tumor, but doesn't know if it's cancer. If the results show that you have renal cell carcinoma, your doctor will find out what stage it's in, so you can decide on the best treatment options. The stage of cancer depends on how large your tumor is and whether the cancer has spread to other parts of your body. You may have tests to take a closer look inside your chest and belly, like: Chest X-ray CT scan MRI, which uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of the inside of your body Bone scan What stage is my cancer? You may need to try several before finding one that works. The best plan for you depends on the stage of your cancer, how healthy you are overall, and any side effects you might have. Your options may include: Surgery to remove part or all of the kidney Biologic drugs, which boost your body's own defenses to fight cancer cells. You might take drugs like interferon-alfa or interleukin-2. Targeted therapy -- treatments that attack specific things cancers need to survive, like a tumor's blood vessels or certain proteins. In some cases, your doctor may still prescribe them to ease your symptoms or if other treatments haven't worked. Talk with her about these options and how they might make you feel. Scientists also are looking for new ways to treat renal cell carcinoma in clinical trials. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for you. It's important to treat your disease, but also to make sure you're comfortable. Tell your doctor if you're feeling any pain. You can do things during and after your treatment to feel stronger physically and emotionally. You need calories and nutrients to stay strong for treatment. If it's hard for you to eat, try smaller meals every few hours instead of three big meals. Your treatment may leave you feeling tired, so be sure to balance activity with rest. Keep your doctor in the loop about any changes in how you're feeling. It's important to take care of your emotional health, too. Trained counselors and support groups can offer safe places to talk about how you and your loved ones feel. Also, ask for help from family, friends, and members of your community. Your outlook depends on the stage of your disease. The earlier you find and treat renal cell carcinoma, the better your progress will be.

Once the fever goes away, she might also develop a raised, spotty, reddish rash, mainly on her neck and trunk. Your child might also have diarrhea, cough, and droopy or swollen eyelids. It remains in the child's body but usually remains latent, or turned off. A doctor usually knows your child has roseola because of the telltale symptoms: high fever followed by rash. For high fever, he might recommend acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Roseola is contagious, so your doctor will tell you to keep your child away from others, at least until the fever goes away. Once it's been gone for at least 24 hours, she can play with other kids, even if she still has a rash. Sometimes, a very high fever may cause seizures.

The symptoms of reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome typically begin with burning pain, especially in an arm, finger(s), palm of the hand(s), and/or shoulder(s). The exact cause of RSDS is not fully understood, although it may be associated with injury to the nerves, trauma, surgery, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, infection, or radiation therapy."], [830, "Refractory Epilepsy ", "If your doctor says you have refractory epilepsy, it means that medicine isn't bringing your seizures under control. You might hear the condition called by some other names, such as uncontrolled, intractable, or drug-resistant epilepsy. Epilepsy is the medical name for having seizures again and again, when there doesn't seem to be a clear cause. In an epilepsy seizure, your brain has a sudden burst of electrical activity. When that happens, you might start shaking without being able to control it. You could black out or simply stop moving and lose awareness of your surroundings. Your doctor can try certain things to help keep your seizures under better control. Your doctor may also put a device under your skin that sends electrical signals to one of your nerves, called the vagus nerve. Surgery that removes a part of the brain that causes your seizures may also be an option. With any of these treatments, you may still need to take epilepsy medicine throughout your life. It's natural to feel anxious when the doctor tells you your epilepsy isn't getting better with the medicine you're now taking. It's important to reach out to family and friends to get the emotional support you need. You might also want to join a support group, so you can talk with other people who are going through the same things you are. Your child might develop epilepsy from a serious infection, such as meningitis. In an adult, a brain tumor or a stroke could lead to epilepsy. If you're taking an anti-epilepsy drug and still have seizures, you may have refractory epilepsy. Your seizures could take different forms and last from a few seconds to a few minutes. You may have convulsions, which means you can't stop your body from shaking. When you have a seizure, you may also: Black out Lose ability to control your bowels or bladder Stare into space Fall down suddenly Get stiff muscles Bite your tongue Your doctor may use several ways to diagnose refractory epilepsy. Your doctor may also give you a test called an electroencephalogram. You might also need to get an MRI of your brain. If you need surgery to treat refractory epilepsy, these tests can help doctors find out where your seizures are starting. Your doctor will most likely want you to report your symptoms regularly. What tests are needed to diagnose refractory epilepsy? Your doctor may take a second look at the drugs you're taking. He may suggest another medicine, either alone or combined with other drugs, to see if it helps you have fewer seizures. If you still have seizures after trying two or three anti-epilepsy drugs, your doctor might recommend brain surgery. It's natural to worry about brain surgery and to wonder if it will affect the way you think or if you'll seem like a different person afterward. Talk with your doctor about what to expect if you choose the surgery or if you don't, so you can weigh the risks and benefits. The surgeon usually removes a portion of brain tissue by operating on an area of your head that's behind your hairline, so you won't have noticeable scars. After it's done, you'll probably need to stay in an intensive care unit of the hospital for a few days. After that, you'll move to a regular hospital room, where you may need to stay for up to 2 weeks. You should take it easy for a while after you get back home, but you'll probably be able to return to a normal routine in 1 to 3 months. Even with the surgery, you might need to take seizure medication for a few years. You may need to stay on the drugs for the rest of your life. Talk to your doctor about any side effects you might have from the surgery. You have to start it in a specific way and follow it strictly, so you need a doctor's supervision. Your doctor will watch closely to see whether or when you can lower any of your medication levels. Because the diet is so specific, you may need to take vitamin or mineral supplements. Doctors aren't sure why the ketogenic diet works, but some studies show that children with epilepsy who stay on the diet have a better chance of reducing their seizures or their medications. You don't have to restrict calories, protein, or fluids. Also, you don't weigh or measure foods. People with seizures that are hard to treat have also tried a low-glycemic index diet. Your doctor might recommend vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) to treat refractory epilepsy. The device sends a current to the nerve, which may cut down on the number of seizures you get or make them less intense. You may want to ask your doctor if you could take part in a clinical trial. Talking to a counselor is a great way to find solutions to manage your stress. Even though you have refractory epilepsy, it's still possible that there's a way to get your seizures under control. Your doctor may find a different drug combination that helps. And if a brain surgeon can remove the part of the brain that's causing seizures, the seizures may stop, or at least happen less often and become less intense. As you are finding out what works best, you'll need to a strong network of family and friends who can offer emotional support, especially if your seizures prove hard to control. Having a trusted person to listen can be a great comfort when you're going through something tough.

Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you can take a generic equivalent for the brand-name medicine that you take now. Generic equivalents are made according to the same strict U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards as brand-name drugs. So generics have the same quality, strength, purity, and stability as their more expensive brand names. If there is not an equivalent, ask your doctor if there is a similar medicine in the same class that may be less expensive or that has a generic equivalent. Finding a good deal is important, but be sure that your pharmacist (or pharmacists) knows your medical history, including all the medicines you take-both prescription and over-the-counter (nonprescription) drugs as well as dietary supplements and herbs-even if you didn't get them at that particular pharmacy.

Look for websites that display the NABP VIPPS (Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites) seal, which means they meet state and federal requirements. If you decide to buy your medicine on the Internet, be a smart shopper and learn how to buy drugs safely online. Pill splitting is another strategy that can help you save money without losing drug effectiveness or safety. Some tablets are available at double the dose and at the same or almost the same cost as lower doses. By splitting the larger dose, you can essentially get two doses for the price of one. But many medicines should not be split, including timed-release pills and capsules. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if any of your prescription medicines are sold at higher dosages and if it's possible to split them. Ask your doctor to write a prescription for several months' supply of medicines that you take consistently. Keep in mind that your insurance company may limit the amount of medicine you can get at one time. Sometimes the price for a 3-month supply of medicine is less costly than if you were to pay an insurance copay each month for three months. If you are trying a medicine for the first time, don't get more than a 30-day supply. That way, if you have concerns about side effects, you can talk to your doctor about trying another medicine. For more ideas about how to pay for medicines, how to remember to take them, and when to call your doctor, see Quick Tips: Taking Medicines Wisely. Take time to find out about how your medical insurance or managed health care plan covers medicine costs. With some insurance plans, you may have to pay more for medicines that are not on the plan's list of preferred medicines (also known as a formulary). Your insurance company also may not pay for certain medicines such as weight-loss and hair-growth drugs. Ask the customer service representative whether your medicines are covered, whether you need to buy at certain pharmacies, and about your copayment. If you have a choice between plans, check what your copayment for prescription drugs will be, the maximum amount the plan will pay in a year, and other details. When you buy medicines, find out which payment option will be the least expensive. Some things to consider include whether there is a generic version of a preferred medicine and whether an over-the-counter equivalent costs less than your copayment. Bring a copy of your health care plan's list of preferred prescription drugs to your next doctor appointment. For example, nonprescription naproxen (Aleve) is a fraction of the cost of the prescription equivalent Naprosyn. (Generic versions of over-the-counter medicines can save you even more money.) Often nonprescription equivalents of prescription medicines come in lower strengths, so get instructions from your doctor or pharmacist on how to take them. Many brand-name prescription medicines, either over the Internet, by mail order, or in person, cost less from Canadian pharmacies than from their U.S. counterparts. The FDA warns that the safety of drugs bought from other countries cannot be ensured. But many doctors say that Canada also demands safety and efficacy for medicines. To get your doctor to help, tell him or her that your prescription medicine bill is a financial burden. Ask for drugs that are less expensive but that work just as well. Often, a condition can be treated with one of several different medicines, and your doctor may be able to prescribe one that costs less. You might ask your doctor if he or she has medicine samples, vouchers, or other resources for you, especially when you are trying out a new medicine to see whether it will work.

This means that you can get measles if you are near someone who has the virus even if that person doesn't cough or sneeze directly on you. The virus is most often spread when people first get sick, before they know they have it. The first symptoms of measles are like a bad cold-a high fever, a runny nose, sneezing, a sore throat, and a hacking cough. You also may feel very tired and have diarrhea and red, sore eyes. When adults get measles, they usually feel worse than children who get it. It usually takes about 7 to 18 days to get symptoms after you have been around someone who has measles. If you think you have measles, call ahead and explain your symptoms before you go to a doctor's office. After you've had an exam, your doctor may order a blood test and/or viral culture if he or she suspects that you have measles. Also, get plenty of rest and drink lots of fluids. Stay away from other people as much as you can so that you don't spread the disease. Anyone who has measles should stay out of school, day care, work, and public places until at least 4 days after the rash first appeared. Your doctor may suggest vitamin A supplements if your child has measles. If you have been exposed to measles and you have not had the vaccine, you may be able to prevent the infection by getting immunoglobulin (IG) or the measles vaccine as soon as possible. Babies who are younger than 12 months, pregnant women, and people who have impaired immune systems that can't fight infection may need to get IG if they are exposed to measles. Getting your child vaccinated is important, because measles can sometimes cause serious problems. But studies have found no link between vaccines and autism.1 Measles is one of the most contagious diseases. For instance, a person from another country may have measles and not know it yet. If that person travels outside his or her own country, he or she could spread measles to people who are not immune.

The rectum or the colon may be connected to the vagina or the bladder by a tunnel (fistula)."], [838, "Rectal Prolapse", "Rectal prolapse occurs when part or all of the wall of the rectum slides out of place, sometimes sticking out of the anus. Partial prolapse (also called mucosal prolapse). The lining (mucous membrane) of the rectum slides out of place and usually sticks out of the anus. The entire wall of the rectum slides out of place and usually sticks out of the anus. At first, this may occur only during bowel movements. And in some cases, the prolapsed tissue may remain outside your body all the time. One part of the wall of the large intestine (colon) or rectum may slide into or over another part, like the folding parts of a toy telescope. In adults, it is usually related to another intestinal problem, such as a growth of tissue in the wall of the intestines (such as a polyp or tumor). In severe cases of rectal prolapse, a section of the large intestine drops from its normal position as the tissues that hold it in place stretch. Typically there is a sharp bend where the rectum begins. With rectal prolapse, this bend and other curves in the rectum may straighten, making it difficult to keep stool from leaking out (fecal incontinence). Many things increase the chance of developing rectal prolapse. The first symptoms of rectal prolapse may be: Leakage of stool from the anus (fecal incontinence). Leakage of mucus or blood from the anus (wet anus). Other symptoms of rectal prolapse include: A feeling of having full bowels and an urgent need to have a bowel movement. Bright red tissue that sticks out of the anus. See a doctor if you or your child has symptoms of rectal prolapse. For example, the leaking stool could get worse, or the rectum could be damaged. He or she will also do a physical exam, which includes checking the rectum for loose tissue and to find out how strongly the anal sphincter contracts. For example, you may need a sigmoidoscopy, a colonoscopy, or a barium enema to look for tumors, sores (ulcers), or abnormally narrow areas in the large intestine. Or a child may need a sweat test to check for cystic fibrosis if prolapse has occurred more than once or the cause is not clear. If you can, push the prolapse into place as soon as it occurs. You can also have your child use a potty-training toilet so that he or she does not strain while having a bowel movement. For example, if the prolapse doesn't go away on its own, an injection of medicine into the rectum may help. If the prolapse was caused by another condition, the child may need treatment for that condition. Home treatment for adults may help treat the prolapse and may be tried before other types of treatments. If your doctor says it's okay, you can push the prolapse into place. Drink plenty of water, and eat fruits, vegetables, and other foods that contain fiber. Changes in diet often are enough to improve or reverse a prolapse of the lining of the rectum (partial prolapse). Do Kegel exercises to help strengthen the muscles of the pelvic area. People who have a complete prolapse or who have a partial prolapse that doesn't improve with a change in diet will need surgery. Surgery involves attaching the rectum to the muscles of the pelvic floor or the lower end of the spine (sacrum). Or surgery might involve removing a section of the large intestine that is no longer supported by the surrounding tissue. Both procedures may be done in the same surgery."], [839, "Rectal cancer: Treatment - Health Profes...", "Kidney cancer -- also called renal cancer -- is a disease in which kidney cells become malignant (cancerous) and grow out of control, forming a tumor. Almost all kidney cancers first appear in the lining of tiny tubes (tubules) in the kidney. The good news is that most of kidney cancers are found before they spread (metastasize) to distant organs. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. Their main job is to clean your blood, removing waste products and making urine. Doctors don't know the causes of kidney cancer. But certain factors appear to increase the risk of getting kidney cancer. If you smoke cigarettes, your risk for kidney cancer is twice that of nonsmokers. Having advanced kidney disease or being on long-term dialysis, a treatment for people with kidneys that have stopped working Having certain genetic conditions, such as von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease or inherited papillary renal cell carcinoma Having a family history of kidney cancer. Being exposed to certain chemicals, such as asbestos, cadmium, benzene, organic solvents, or certain herbicides Having high blood pressure. Doctors don't know whether high blood pressure or medication used to treat it is the source of the increased risk. For an unknown reason, there is an increased risk of kidney cancer in patients with lymphoma. Having these risk factors does not mean you will get kidney cancer. In many cases, people may have no early symptoms of kidney cancer. As the tumor grows larger, symptoms may appear. You may have one or more of these kidney cancer symptoms: Blood in your urine A lump in your side or abdomen A loss of appetite A pain in your side that doesn't go away Weight loss that occurs for no known reason Fever that lasts for weeks and isn't caused by a cold or other infection Extreme fatigue Anemia Swelling in your ankles or legs Kidney cancer that spreads to other parts of your body may cause other symptoms, such as: Shortness of breath Coughing up blood Bone pain Maybe you've had kidney cancer symptoms such as pain in your side, weight loss, or extreme fatigue. Or maybe your doctor has found a lump in your side during a routine exam or a sign of kidney cancer during a test for another disease. Regardless, to confirm a diagnosis of kidney cancer, you will need a thorough physical exam, health history, and tests. Your doctor will feel your abdomen and side for lumps and check for fever and high blood pressure, among other things. You will also answer questions about your health habits, any past illnesses, and types of treatment. To make a diagnosis of kidney cancer, your doctor will also order one or more tests like these: Urine tests check for blood in your urine or other signs of problems. Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) involves X-raying your kidneys after the doctor injects a dye that travels to your urinary tract, highlighting any tumors. Ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of your kidneys. A CT scan uses X-rays and a computer to create a series of detailed pictures of your kidneys. CT scans have virtually replaced pyelogram and ultrasound as a tool for diagnosing kidney cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of soft tissues in your body. It is not given often, but may help diagnose small tumors. Unlike with many other cancers, your doctor may be pretty certain about a diagnosis of kidney cancer without a biopsy. A doctor may use a needle biopsy to remove a sample of tissue, which is then examined under a microscope for cancer cells. The biopsy may also tell the grade of the cancer -- how aggressive the cancer is likely to be. Often the surgeon will simply remove the entire tumor and then have a sample of tissue examined. Once your doctor makes a diagnosis of kidney cancer, you may need other tests to tell if the cancer has spread within your kidney, to the other kidney, or to other parts of your body. These tests will help your doctor determine the stage of kidney cancer. Your prognosis depends on your general health, as well as the grade and stage of your kidney cancer. Stage I A tumor 7 centimeters or smaller that is only in the kidney Stage II A tumor larger than 7 centimeters that is only in the kidney Stage III A tumor that is in the kidney and in at least one nearby lymph node A tumor that is in the kidney's main blood vessel and may also be in nearby lymph node A tumor that is in the fatty tissue around the kidney and may also involve nearby lymph nodes A tumor that extends into major veins or perinephric tissues, but not into the ipsilateral adrenal gland and not beyond Gerota's fascia Stage IV Cancer has spread beyond the fatty layer of tissue around the kidney, and it may also be in nearby lymph nodes Cancer may have spread to other organs, such as the bowel, pancreas, or lungs Cancer has spread beyond Gerota's fascia (including contiguous extension into the ipsilateral adrenal gland) Once you have a diagnosis and know your stage of kidney cancer, you and your doctor can plan treatment. Before beginning treatment, many people find it helpful to get a second opinion about the diagnosis of kidney cancer and the treatment plan. Kidney cancer is one of the more common cancers to undergo spontaneous remission. Even if surgery removes the entire tumor, though, your doctor may suggest an extra treatment to kill any remaining cancer cells that can't be seen. Surgery for kidney cancer These are the main types of surgery for kidney cancer. Radical nephrectomy removes the kidney, adrenal gland, and surrounding tissue. It is the most common surgery for kidney cancer and can now be done through a small incision with a laparoscope. Partial nephrectomy removes the cancer in the kidney along with some tissue around it. This procedure is used for patients with smaller tumors (less than 4 cm) or in those patients in which a radical nephrectomy might hurt the other kidney. You can survive with just a part of one kidney as long as it is still working. If the surgeon removes both kidneys or if both kidneys are not working, you will need a machine to clean your blood (dialysis) or a new kidney (kidney transplant). A transplant is possible if your cancer was found only in your kidney and a donated kidney is available. If surgery can't remove your kidney cancer, your doctor may suggest another option to help destroy the tumor. Arterial embolization involves inserting material into an artery that leads to the kidney. This procedure may be done to help shrink the tumor before surgery. Biologic therapy for kidney cancer This therapy uses your immune system to fight cancer by boosting, directing, or restoring your body's natural defenses. Targeted therapy for kidney cancer This therapy uses drugs or other substances to find and target cancer cells with less toxicity to normal cells. These keep blood vessels from feeding a tumor, causing it to shrink or stop growing. Each of these drugs has a unique place in the management of advanced kidney cancer. Radiation therapy for kidney cancer Often used to help with symptoms of kidney cancer or in patients who cannot have surgery, this treatment uses high-energy X-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or halt their growth. Less effective for kidney cancer than for other types of cancer, chemotherapy is mostly used for a certain type of kidney cancer in which there spindle cells (sarcomatoid variant). Because doctors don't know the causes of kidney cancer, it is not clear how to prevent the disease. However, certain factors are linked to kidney cancer, so you can take certain steps to lower your risk -- quit smoking, maintain a healthy weight, manage your blood pressure, and avoid being exposed to harmful chemicals."], [840, "Rectal Cancer Treatment by Stage", "Your doctor may talk about your \"stage\" of rectal cancer. These stages are a lot like those for colon cancer, but because the tumor is much lower in the large intestine, treatment options may vary. Surgery to remove the cancer is almost always the first treatment. In this very early stage, the tumor is only on the inner lining of the rectum. Your doctor may consider whether you can get radiation treatment, given either externally (beamed in from the outside) or internally (radioactive beads that go inside the rectum). Your doctor may add chemotherapy to give the radiation treatment a boost. At this stage, the tumor has gone all the way through the bowel wall and may have invaded nearby organs, like the bladder, uterus, or prostate gland. Treatment includes: Surgery to remove the tumor Radiation with chemotherapy before or after surgery Chemotherapy, which may also be an option after surgery In this stage, the cancer has spread (or \"metastasized\") to distant parts of the body, often to the liver and lung. The main treatment is chemotherapy, but your doctor may also recommend surgery to remove the tumor. It's not generally considered to be a cure, though it may help someone with stage IV rectal cancer live longer. If there are only one or two liver tumors, a surgeon may be able to remove them. Other options include freezing the tumors (cryosurgery) or destroying them with microwaves or heat (radiofrequency ablation). Other nonsurgical treatments include giving chemotherapy directly into the liver using radioactive isotopes (radioembolization) or cutting off the blood supply to the tumor in the liver (embolization). Often, doctors give chemotherapy directly into the liver along with embolization. This means the cancer has come back after treatment, either in the same area or in a distant part of the body. Treatment includes: Surgery to remove it if it's in the same area as the original cancer. If surgery can't remove all of the recurrences, many experts recommend chemotherapy with or without radiation. Sometimes, this shrinks the tumor enough for surgeons to remove it later."], [841, "Rectal Cancer", "This topic will tell you about the early testing, diagnosis, and treatment of colorectal cancer. If you want to learn about colorectal cancer that has come back or has spread, see the topic Colorectal Cancer, Metastatic or Recurrent. If you want to learn about anal cancer, see the topic Anal Cancer. Colorectal cancer means that cells that aren't normal are growing in your colon or rectum . This cancer is also called colon cancer or rectal cancer, depending on where the cancer is. The exact cause of colorectal cancer is not known. Most cases begin as small growths, or polyps, inside the colon or rectum. Colon polyps are very common. If they are found early, usually through routine screening tests, they can be removed before they turn into cancer. See your doctor if you have any of these symptoms: Pain in your belly Blood in your stool or very dark stools A change in your bowel habits, such as more frequent stools or a feeling that your bowels are not emptying completely If your doctor thinks that you may have this cancer, you will need a test, called a colonoscopy (say \"koh-luh-NAW-skuh-pee\"), that lets the doctor see the inside of your entire colon and rectum. During this test, your doctor will remove polyps or take tissue samples from any areas that don't look normal. The tissue will be looked at under a microscope to see if it contains cancer. Sometimes another test, such as a sigmoidoscopy (say \"sig-moy-DAW-skuh-pee\"), is used to diagnose colorectal cancer. Screening tests can find or prevent many cases of colon and rectal cancer. They look for a certain disease or condition before any symptoms appear. Experts recommend routine colon cancer testing for everyone age 50 and older who has a normal risk for colon cancer. Your doctor may recommend getting tested more often or at a younger age if you have a higher risk. Talk to your doctor about when you should be tested. The most common screening tests are: Stool tests that check for signs of cancer, such as blood in the stool. A doctor uses a lighted scope to see the lower portion of the intestine. Doctors can also remove polyps during this test. A doctor puts a long, flexible tube into your rectum and colon. With this test, the doctor can see the entire large intestine.

Depending on how bad your sprain is, it can take weeks or months to heal. Working your muscles can help protect your ligaments. You can start working on your ankle once your range of motion is back and you can put weight on it. And don't just work your injured ankle. Try these stretches: Calf stretch: Stand about 2 feet from a wall, facing the wall. Keep your back leg straight and both heels down. Gently bend your front knee until you feel the stretch in the back of your other leg. Reverse the order of your feet and repeat to stretch both legs. Heel stretch: Sit down on the floor with your knee bent slightly. Gently pull back until you feel the stretch in your calf and heel. Do these exercises six times a day for each leg, especially after exercise or another activity. Strong leg muscles keep your ankles more stable. Grab a chair and take a seat to work the front and inner sides of your shins. Front \"push-out:\" With the chair beside a wall, hold your foot flat on the floor and against the wall. Push the foot against the wall and hold for 3 seconds. Front \"push-up:\" Put your injured foot flat on the floor. Place the heel of the other foot on top of the hurt one. Inner \"push-in:\" With your feet flat on the floor, push them against each other. If you don't have good balance, your odds of hurting your ankles go up. Make it more of a challenge by doing something while standing on one foot -- like brushing your hair or talking on the phone. Take your time when you walk on cracked sidewalks or uneven surfaces. Pick boots that support your foot and ankle for hiking or working on uneven land. And consider shoe inserts to keep your arch supported and ankle lined up the way it should be.

Attachment develops when a child is repeatedly soothed, comforted, and cared for, and when the caregiver consistently meets the child's needs. It is through attachment with a loving and protective caregiver that a young child learns to love and trust others, to become aware of others' feelings and needs, to regulate his or her emotions, and to develop healthy relationships and a positive self-image. The absence of emotional warmth during the first few years of life can negatively affect a child's entire future. RAD can affect every aspect of a child's life and development. Detached Unresponsive or resistant to comforting Excessively inhibited (holding back emotions) Withdrawn or a mixture of approach and avoidance Indiscriminate sociability Inappropriately familiar or selective in the choice of attachment figures RAD occurs when attachment between a young child and his or her primary caregiver does not occur or is interrupted due to grossly negligent care. This can occur for many reasons, including: Persistent disregard of the child's emotional needs for comfort, stimulation, and affection Persistent disregard of the child's basic physical needs Repeated changes of primary caregivers that prevent formation of stable attachments (for example, frequent changes in foster care) It is difficult to know exactly how many children have RAD, since many families affected by the disorder never seek help. As with adults, mental disorders in children are diagnosed based on signs and symptoms that suggest a particular condition. If the doctor cannot find a physical cause for the symptoms, he or she will likely refer the child to a child and adolescent psychiatrist or psychologist, mental health professionals who are specially trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses in children and teens. The doctor bases his or her diagnosis on reports of the child's symptoms, and his or her observation of the child's attitude and behavior. The second goal is to help the child develop a healthy relationship with an appropriate caregiver. Counseling may be used to address the issues that are affecting the caregiver's relationship with and behavior toward the child. Teaching parenting skills also can help improve the relationship with the child and help develop attachment. This technique allows the child and the caregiver to express their thoughts, fears, and needs in the safe context of play. If not treated, RAD can have a negative impact on a child's physical, emotional, behavioral, social, and moral development. Children with RAD generally are at higher risk for: Depression Aggressive and/or disruptive behavior Learning difficulties and behavior problems in school Inability to form meaningful relationships Low self-esteem With treatment, it is possible for children with RAD to learn to trust others, and to lead healthy and productive lives."], [846, "RDD", "Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rare disorder characterized by overproduction (proliferation) and accumulation of a specific type of white blood cell (histiocyte) in the lymph nodes of the body (lymphadenopathy), most often those of the neck (cervical lymphadenopathy).

For severe razor bumps, you may need a special skin cream, such as hydrocortisone, antibiotic, or tretinoin cream. Waxing and plucking may cause razor bumps. Hair removal products called depilatories do not cause razor bumps. But they can irritate the skin and should be used only once or twice a week.

Your body doesn't send enough blood to your hands and feet, so they feel very cold and numb. In most cases, this lasts for a short time when your body overreacts to cold temperatures. For most people, Raynaud's is more of a nuisance than a disability. Raynaud's is usually a symptom of another disease, such as lupus, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, or atherosclerosis. The most common trigger is exposure to cold. In the cold, it's normal for the body to narrow the small blood vessels to the skin and to open the blood vessels to the inside parts of the body to keep the body warm. But with Raynaud's, the body restricts blood flow to the skin more than it needs to. Other triggers can include emotional stress and things that affect the flow of blood, such as smoking, caffeine, and some medicines. During an attack of Raynaud's, the body limits blood flow to the hands and feet. This makes them feel cold and numb and then turn white or blue. As blood flow returns and the fingers or toes warm up, they may turn red and begin to throb and hurt. In rare cases, Raynaud's affects the nose or ears. To diagnose Raynaud's, your doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms and do a physical exam. If you can take a photo of the affected area during an attack, the photo may also be helpful to your doctor. If you have Raynaud's that is caused by another disease, your doctor can treat that disease. There is no cure for Raynaud's that occurs on its own (primary Raynaud's). But you may be able to control it by avoiding the things that trigger it. Avoid caffeine and certain medicines, including cold medicines with pseudoephedrine and beta-blockers. This may increase blood flow to your hands and feet and relieve symptoms. Some alternative treatments, such as herbal supplements and biofeedback training, have shown promise in treating Raynaud's. To keep your hands and feet warm: Wear mittens or gloves when it's cold outside. (Mittens are warmer than gloves, because they keep your fingers together.) When you drink from a cold can or bottle, use an insulated cover. Swing your arms rapidly in a circle at the sides of your body (\"windmilling\"). If your hands or feet get cold, run warm (not hot) water over them. This can increase blood flow to them. To keep your whole body warm: Wear layers of warm clothing. The inner layer should be made of a fabric such as polypropylene that pulls moisture away from your body. You lose more body heat from your head than from any other part of your body.

In adults and older children, rashes are often caused by contact with a substance that irritates the skin (contact dermatitis ). A more severe reaction may cause swelling, redness, and larger blisters. After you have had a reaction to the substance, a rash can occur in response to even very small amounts of the substance. Allergy to natural rubber latex affects people who are exposed to rubber products on a regular basis, especially health care workers, rubber industry workers, and people who have had multiple surgeries. Latex allergies can cause a severe reaction. Rashes may occur with viral infections, such as herpes zoster; fungal infections, such as a yeast infection (Candida albicans); bacterial infections, such as impetigo; and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

(To see a map of the U.S. radon zones, see the website www.epa.gov/radon/zonemap.html.) But the construction features and exact location of your house may be just as likely to affect your risk. Unless your home or office is tested for high radon levels, you may not realize that you are being exposed to dangerous levels of radon until you or someone in your family is diagnosed with lung cancer. Surgeon General and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommend that all homes be tested for radon levels. You can hire a qualified tester to do the test, or you can use a do-it-yourself test kit. The short-term test kit stays in your home or office for 2 to 90 days. So you may want to follow up the first short-term test with a second test. The long-term test kit stays in your home or office for more than 90 days. The EPA recommends placing the test kit in your home on the lowest level that you regularly use. If you have questions about radon in your house, you can get help from the EPA by calling 1-800-55-RADON (1-800-557-2366). If tests find a high level of radon, you'll need to reduce it. Other control methods include sealing cracks in the foundation or walls and using air cleaners.2 Venting radon out of the building. Once the radon is prevented from entering the building, venting can be done to reduce the level of radon. These may include using fans, blowers, and suction devices to remove radon in the air in crawl spaces, basements, and other areas. Use an EPA-qualified contractor with proper training in radon reduction to help with this work. After radon reduction or prevention procedures are done, the home or building should be retested. It is usually safe to live in the home or building while the radon is being vented, but you may want to confirm this with your local EPA office.

You may have few or only mild side effects from your treatment; someone else may have a lot of problems or very severe ones. When you get radiation therapy, you'll work with a doctor who specializes in this type of medicine. It's important to talk with her about how the treatment might make you feel and what you can do to feel better. If you keep your health team informed, they can help you get through treatment. There are two kinds of radiation side effects: early and late. They may start during or right after treatment and last for several weeks after it ends, but then they get better. Late side effects, such as lung or heart problems, may take years to show up and are often permanent when they do. The fatigue you feel from cancer and radiation therapy is different from other times you may have felt tired. It's an exhaustion that doesn't get better with rest and can keep you from doing the things you normally do, like going to work or spending time with family and friends. It can even change how well you're able to follow your cancer treatment plan. There are also things you can do to feel better: Take care of your health. Get plenty of rest, be as active as you can, and eat the right foods. Work with a counselor or take a class at your cancer treatment center to learn ways to conserve energy, reduce stress, and keep yourself from focusing on the fatigue. If fatigue is interfering with your job, talk with your boss or HR department and ask about taking some time off from work or making adjustments in your schedule. Keep in mind that the fatigue from radiation therapy will probably go away within a few weeks after your treatment ends. The way external radiation therapy affects your skin is similar to what happens when you spend time in the sun. Your skin may also become dry, flaky, or itchy. Be gentle with your skin: Don't wear tight clothing over the area that's being treated. Avoid putting anything hot or cold on the area unless the doctor tells you to. Ask your doctor before you use any type of ointment, oil, lotion, or powder on your skin. Ask about using corn starch to help relieve itching. Ask the doctor about using sunscreen if you must be outdoors. If you're having radiation therapy for breast cancer, try not to wear a bra. Don't use any tape, gauze, or bandages on your skin unless the doctor tells you to. Your skin should start to feel better a few weeks after therapy ends. If you lose hair on top of your head, be sure to wear a hat or a scarf to protect your scalp from the sun when you go outside. If you decide to buy a wig, ask the doctor to write a prescription for one and check to see if it's covered by your insurance or is a tax-deductible expense. Eating Problems Radiation therapy to the head, neck, or parts of the digestive system can make you lose your appetite. It will help you eat when you're hungry rather than waiting for mealtimes and maybe losing your appetite. Mouth Problems Before you start radiation to your head or neck, see your dentist for a thorough exam. Radiation can cause problems in your mouth that include: Mouth sores (little cuts or ulcers) Lack of saliva Thick saliva Trouble swallowing Jaw stiffness Tell your cancer team about any of these problems so they can help you feel better. To help manage these side effects: Avoid spicy and acidic foods. Hearing Problems Radiation therapy to the head can sometimes cause hearing problems. Let your doctor know if you have trouble hearing. Nausea Radiation to the head, neck, and any part of the digestive tract can cause nausea and vomiting. Also, you might be able to learn relaxation techniques and biofeedback to help control and reduce feelings of nausea. Diarrhea Radiation therapy to your belly can cause diarrhea, which typically starts a few weeks after therapy begins. Fertility and Sexual Issues Radiation therapy to your pelvis can affect your sex drive and whether you'll be able to have a child. If you want to start a family or have more children, it's important to talk to your doctor about how the treatment will affect your fertility before treatment begins. For men, radiation to the testes can affect sperm count and how well they work. Treatment to the pelvis can make sex painful for some women and can also cause scarring that makes the vagina less able to stretch. In men, radiation can affect the nerves and blood vessels that control erections. Your doctor can help you understand what might happen and how you can handle it. It's natural to have less interest in sex when you're having treatment for cancer. Talk openly with your partner about how you can stay close. These problems happen when radiation damages your body. For example, scar tissue can affect the way your lungs or your heart works. Bladder, bowel, fertility, and sexual problems can start after radiation to your belly or pelvis. Doctors have known for a long time that radiation can cause cancer. And research has shown that, although rare, some people can get the disease again after radiation therapy has cured them before. Talk with your doctor about the potential risk and how it compares to the benefits you'll get from radiation therapy."], [857, "Radiation Disease", "Summary Radiation sickness describes the harmful effects--acute, delayed, or chronic--produced by exposure to ionizing radiation. As a rule, large doses of radiation are of concern because of their immediate effects on the body (somatic), while low doses are of concern because of the potential for possible late somatic and long-term genetic effects. Although there is currently no treatment to repair cells that have already been damaged by radiation, the FDA has recently approved drugs that are very effective at removing radioactive elements from the body. Because the damage is irreversible, patients exposed to radiation that are experiencing symptoms should seek medical help immediately so that drugs can be administered. Radiation sickness can result in patients with low exposure levels, such as cancer treatments, and leave them with symptoms similar to a case of the flu. However, in cases of extreme exposure caused from atomic weapons or a power plant meltdown, such as Chernobyl, the effects can be fatal. The units of measurement commonly used in determining radiation exposure or dose are the roentgen, the rad, and the rem. The radiation absorbed dose (rad) is the amount of energy absorbed in any substance from exposure, and applies to all types of radiation. The rem is used to correct for the observation that some types of radiation, such as neutrons, may produce more biological effect for an equivalent amount of absorbed energy; thus the rem is equal to the rad multiplied by a constant called the \"quality factor\". The rad and the rem are currently being replaced in the scientific nomenclature by two units that are compatible with the International System of Units, namely the gray (Gy), equal to 100 rads and the Sievert (Sv), equal to 100 rem."], [858, "Radial Head Subluxation", "Radial head subluxation means that the radius, one of two long bones in the lower arm (forearm) , has pulled away from its normal position. When this happens, the radial bone can't move back into its normal place. It happens when a young child is pulled or lifted by the hand or wrist while his or her arm is held straight. For example, the bone can pull out of position, or sublux, when you try to lift a child up onto a sidewalk by the hand, pull a resistant child's hand to get him or her to move faster, or hold onto a child's hands and swing him or her around while playing. After age 3, children's joints and ligaments gradually grow stronger, making radial head subluxation less likely to occur. Although physical abuse is sometimes the cause of this injury, most often a parent, caregiver, or sibling is simply playing or is trying to help or hurry a child along. Symptoms of radial head subluxation include: Refusal to move the arm. Your child may keep the arm dangling down the side of his or her body. Your doctor usually suspects the injury from your report of how it happened, your child's symptoms, and results of the physical exam. The doctor will feel different areas of the arm and try to move it into certain positions. Allow your child to keep the arm in the most comfortable position until you get medical help. You can also put an ice pack on your child's elbow. A doctor will move your child's arm to free the trapped ligament and put the end of the radius back into its normal position. At the same time, he or she gently bends your child's arm at the elbow up toward the shoulder. Usually, your child starts feeling better right away, although sometimes the pain lingers for a bit. It may take from 30 minutes to a few hours for him or her to move the arm normally. The doctor may place a sling or splint on your child's arm to wear until all pain is gone. If your child can move the arm normally without pain soon after treatment, a sling or a splint is not needed. Although your child heals quickly, he or she has a greater chance of having another radial head subluxation, especially in the first few weeks after being injured. This includes when you lift your child up onto a higher surface (such as a sidewalk or equipment at a playground). Use care when walking with your child as you hold his or her hand or lower arm (forearm). If a child pulls back or resists, stop. Be sure to follow your doctor's directions on how to care for your child after a radial head subluxation."], [859, "Rabies", "It affects the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) of mammals, including humans. Animals that are infected with rabies-rabid animals-can spread the disease through their saliva or through brain tissue. It is rare for people in the United States or Canada to get rabies. People in the U.S. and Canada are most likely to get rabies from bats.1 People in many other countries are most likely to get rabies from dog bites.2, 3 Bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, and coyotes are the animals most likely to have rabies in the U.S. and Canada. Sometimes the rabies virus can spread to pets, such as dogs, cats, and ferrets. But household pets rarely get rabies, because most of them get rabies vaccines. For example, bat bites or scratches may be so small that you don't notice them. People also can get rabies by handling animals with rabies or inhaling the virus, but these cases are rare. Signs of rabies in animals may include drooling, foaming at the mouth, or paralysis. A pet with rabies also may behave differently than usual, such as acting shy when the pet usually is friendly. A wild animal with rabies may have no fear of humans. Rabies in humans begins with symptoms such as fever, cough, or sore throat. The treatment for someone who has been exposed to rabies is a series of shots known as postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). Getting PEP before symptoms appear usually prevents infection, and you are likely to recover. In the U.S. and Canada, PEP has two parts, usually given at the same time: A shot of human antibodies against rabies, called human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) The rabies vaccination series Some vaccines that aren't approved for use in the U.S. or Canada are used in developing countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) approves of these vaccines.4 But they may cause worse reactions than newer vaccines. If you are exposed to rabies outside of the U.S. or Canada and have any choice, request HDCV (human diploid cell vaccine), RVA (rabies vaccine, adsorbed), or PCEC (purified chick embryo cell culture). If these aren't available, it is better to accept one of the other vaccines than to get no vaccine at all. First, wash the animal bite, scratch, or open sore with soap and water. If you've been bitten by or exposed to an animal at low risk for having rabies, such as a pet, the animal will be captured and watched for signs of rabies. If you've been bitten by or exposed to an animal at high risk for having rabies, you will start getting shots right away. If possible, the animal will be watched for signs of rabies or will be killed for testing. If it turns out that the animal doesn't have rabies, you can stop the shots. If an animal shows signs of rabies but can't be captured for testing, it often is assumed to be rabid. To avoid contact with the rabies virus: Have pet dogs, cats, and ferrets vaccinated against rabies. (If you aren't the first owner of your pet, ask for a certificate of rabies vaccination. If no document exists, confirm with the pet's veterinarian that the pet got the vaccine.) Avoid contact with stray dogs, especially in rural areas of countries where rabies is a risk. It may also be recommended if you plan to travel in areas where rabies is a risk, such as parts of Asia, Africa, and Central and South America."], [860, "R9", "Chromosome 9 Ring is a rare disorder in which there is loss (deletion) of chromosomal material from both ends of the 9th chromosome and joining of the ends to form a ring.

In individuals with Chromosome 15 Ring, the variability of associated symptoms and findings may depend upon the amount and location of genetic material lost from the 15th chromosome, the stability of the ring chromosome during subsequent cellular divisions, or other factors. Evidence suggests that the clinical features seen in Chromosome 15 Ring appear to result from deletions of genetic material from the long arm (q) of chromosome 15 (known as \"monosomy 15q\"), with the ring chromosome typically replacing a normal 15th chromosome. In addition, in some cases, only a certain percentage of an individual's cells may contain Chromosome 15 Ring, while other cells may have a normal chromosomal makeup (a finding known as \"chromosomal mosaicism\"), potentially affecting the variability of associated symptoms and findings. In most cases, Chromosome 15 Ring appears to be caused by spontaneous (de novo) errors very early in embryonic development. In such cases, the parents of the affected child usually have normal chromosomes and a relatively low risk of having another child with the chromosomal abnormality. However, there have been rare cases in which a parent of an affected individual also has Chromosome 15 Ring. In addition, a few cases have been reported in which Chromosome 15 Ring has been the result of a \"balanced translocation\" in one of the parents. Chromosomal analysis and genetic counseling are typically recommended for parents of an affected child to help confirm or exclude the presence of Chromosome 15 Ring, potential mosaicism, or a balanced translocation in one of the parents. Many individuals with Chromosome 15 Ring have some features similar to those associated with Russell-Silver syndrome (RSS), which is a genetic disorder characterized by growth deficiency and short stature, distinctive facial abnormalities, and other features. In some of these cases, genetic analysis has indicated that the prenatal and postnatal growth retardation associated with Chromosome 15 Ring (and potentially suggestive of RSS) may result from deletion of a gene known as the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF1R) gene, which has been mapped to the long arm of chromosome 15 (15q25-q26)."], [865, "Rapp Hodgkin Syndrome", "Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome is the former name of a rare disease that can affect your hair, nails, skin, sweat glands, and teeth. It's caused by a problem with your genes, and it's part of a larger group of conditions that doctors call \"ectodermal dysplasia.\" Doctors now call Rapp-Hodgkin by a different name: AEC syndrome, which stands for ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate. For many years, doctors thought Rapp-Hodgkin was different from another disease called Hay-Wells syndrome. People with Hay-Wells seemed to have a symptom where their eyelids were partly or totally joined together, and people with Rapp-Hodgkin didn't. It turned out that not everyone with Hay-Wells had the eyelid symptom. And with more advanced genetic testing, they found that Hay-Wells and Rapp-Hodgkin were actually the same disease. Although you can't prevent or cure it, doctors can treat it. Each of your cells has two copies of every gene. One comes from your mother and one from your father. AEC is caused by a glitch in one of your genes, the TP63 gene. If either copy of your TP63 gene has the glitch, you'll have AEC. Sometimes, you get AEC from your parents. A parent with the glitch has a 50% chance of passing on the gene to a child. These can differ quite a bit from person to person. This is when the upper lip doesn't fully form and has an opening in it. Fewer sweat glands or none at all. There may also be problems with the tear ducts, which can lead to dry eyes and pinkeye. This is loss of skin in some areas. These can include missing teeth, wide gaps between teeth, cone-shaped teeth, and thin enamel (the hard outer covering of the teeth). The opening of the tube that carries pee outside the body may be on the underside of the penis. Very little hair -- on both head and face -- and dry or brittle hair. Usually, your doctor can tell you have AEC based on your symptoms, health history, and a physical exam. You may also get a genetic test to check on the TP63 gene, but not all labs can do this test. Doctors can treat many of the symptoms of AEC. You'll work with a team that may include surgeons, skin doctors, dentists, eye doctors, and others. You and your family may also want to seek counseling to work through the emotional challenges of having a rare disease. These are anchors that go into the jaw bone to hold replacement teeth.

In some individuals, LCH may be associated with involvement of the pituitary gland leading to diabetes insipidus, growth failure, hypothyroidism, or insufficitne production of sex hormones. Langerhans cell histiocytosis was selected by the Histiocyte Society to replace the older, less specific term histiocytosis X. Histiocytosis X encompassed three entities known as eosinophilic granuloma, Hand-Schuller-Christian disease, and Letterer-Siwe disease that were characterized by the accumulation of histiocytes.

It's a lot like gassing up your car, but in this case, sugar provides the energy. Usually, a hormone called insulin controls the process. It tells the sugar when to move out of your blood and into your cells. Babies who have it tend to be smaller than usual and struggle to grow and gain weight. Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome is part a group of conditions that doctors call severe insulin resistance syndromes. These include Donohue syndrome and type A insulin resistance syndrome. Rabson-Mendenhal is a condition you get from your parents, and it happens because of a glitch in a gene called the INSR gene. When you have Rabson-Mendenhall, it means you have the glitch in both copies of the INSR gene. So when a child gets Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, it's because each parent had one copy that was normal and one that had the glitch. Then, they both happened to pass the copy with the glitch onto the child, and 3 out of 4 times that doesn't happen. Signs and symptoms may start to show in the first year of life and are more severe in some people than in others. These can include rough skin, wide space between the eyes, deep grooves in the tongue, and larger-than-normal ears, lips, and jaw. It may feel like velvet, especially in areas where it folds, like the underarms and neck. They can be larger than normal, crowded, or come in too early. Other common signs and symptoms include: Larger organs than normal, including the kidney, heart, penis, and clitoris Much more hair than is typical Slow growth before and after birth Swelling in the belly Very little fat under the skin Weak muscles And it can lead to conditions such as: Cysts on the ovaries Diabetes, which can cause a life-threatening condition called ketoacidosis Kidney problems One of the challenges in telling whether someone has Rabson-Mendenhall is making sure it's not a similar condition, such as Donohue syndrome. Your child's doctor will do a physical exam and ask about his symptoms and health history. He'll probably want to get blood tests to check on your child's blood sugar and insulin levels. Treating Rabson-Mendenhall usually requires a team of doctors, surgeons, dentists, and others. Your family may also want to seek counseling to work through the emotions of having a rare disease. Since there's no cure, treatment often focuses on specific symptoms, such as surgery to remove cysts or fix dental problems.

If you are looking for information about type 1 diabetes, see the topic Type 1 Diabetes: Children Living With the Disease. Type 2 diabetes is a lifelong disease that develops when the pancreas cannot make enough insulin or when the body's tissues cannot use insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body's cells use sugar (glucose) for energy. It also helps the body store extra energy in muscle, fat, and liver cells. Without insulin, the sugar cannot get into the cells to do its work. High blood sugar also makes a person more likely to get serious illnesses or infections. In the past, doctors believed that type 2 diabetes was an adult disease and that type 1 diabetes was a children's disease. Now, more and more children are getting type 2 diabetes. But your child can live a long, healthy life by learning to manage the disease. Experts believe the main risks for children getting type 2 diabetes are being overweight, not being physically active, and having a family history of the disease. A simple blood test is usually all that is needed to diagnose diabetes. Your child's doctor may do other blood tests if it is not clear whether your child has type 1 or type 2 diabetes. A doctor may test your child for diabetes if he or she is overweight, gets little physical activity, or has other risk factors for the disease. A risk factor is anything that increases your chances of having a disease. Some children are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes when they have a blood or urine test for some other reason. The key to treating diabetes is to keep your child's blood sugar levels within a target range. This will help you and your child learn how different foods and activities affect his or her blood sugar. Teach your child to make healthy food choices. Help your child to eat about the same amount of carbohydrate at each meal. This helps keep your child's blood sugar steady.

The longer a person has diabetes, the more likely he or she is to have problems, such as diseases of the eyes, heart, blood vessels, nerves, and kidneys. But if your child can control his or her blood sugar levels every day, it may help to delay the start of or prevent some of these problems later on. Even when you are careful and do all the right things, your child can have problems with high or low blood sugar. Helping your child stay at a healthy weight and get regular exercise can help prevent type 2 diabetes. What increases a child's risk for type 2 diabetes?"], [875, "Type 2 Diabetes", "Diabetes is a life-long disease that affects the way your body handles glucose, a kind of sugar, in your blood. Another 86 million have prediabetes: Their blood glucose is not normal, but not high enough to be diabetes yet. People with type 2 diabetes make insulin, but their cells don't use it as well as they should. But eventually it can't keep up, and the sugar builds up in your blood instead. Usually a combination of things cause type 2 diabetes, including: Genes. Being overweight or obese can cause insulin resistance, especially if you carry your extra pounds around the middle. Now type 2 diabetes affects kids and teens as well as adults, mainly because of childhood obesity. People with insulin resistance often have a group of conditions including high blood glucose, extra fat around the waist, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol and triglycerides. When your blood sugar is low, your liver makes and sends out glucose. After you eat, your blood sugar goes up, and usually the liver will slow down and store its glucose for later. When these problems affect how your cells make and use insulin or glucose, a chain reaction can lead to diabetes. If the cells that make the insulin send out the wrong amount of insulin at the wrong time, your blood sugar gets thrown off. High blood glucose can damage these cells, too. While certain things make getting diabetes more likely, they won't give you the disease. Age: 45 or older Family: A parent, sister, or brother with diabetes Ethnicity: African-American, Alaska Native, Native American, Asian-American, Hispanic or Latino, or Pacific Islander-American Some things are related to your health and medical history. Prediabetes Heart and blood vessel disease High blood pressure, even if it's treated and under control Low HDL (\"good\") cholesterol High triglycerides Being overweight or obese Having a baby that weighed more than 9 pounds Having gestational diabetes while you were pregnant Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) Acanthosis nigricans, a skin condition with dark rashes around your neck or armpits Depression Other risk factors have to do with your daily habits and lifestyle. Getting little or no exercise Smoking Stress Sleeping too little or too much Because you can't change what happened in the past, focus on what you can do now and going forward. Take medications and follow your doctor's suggestions to be healthy. Dropping just 7% to 10% of your weight can cut your risk of type 2 diabetes in half. Thirty minutes of brisk walking a day will cut your risk by almost a third. Work with your doctor to avoid gaining weight, so you don't create one problem by solving another. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes can be so mild you don't notice them. In fact, about 8 million people who have it don't know it. Being very thirsty Peeing a lot Blurry vision Being irritable Tingling or numbness in your hands or feet Feeling worn out Wounds that don't heal Yeast infections that keep coming back Your doctor can test your blood for signs of diabetes. But if your blood glucose is very high or you have a lot of symptoms, one test may be all you need. A1C: It's like an average of your blood glucose over the past 2 or 3 months. You won't be able to eat or drink anything except water for 8 hours before the test. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): This checks your blood glucose before and 2 hours after you drink a sweet drink to see how your body handles the sugar. Over time, high blood sugar can damage and cause problems with your: Heart and blood vessels Kidneys Eyes Nerves, which can lead to trouble with digestion, the feeling in your feet, and your sexual response Wound healing Pregnancy The best way to avoid these complications is to manage your diabetes well. Take your diabetes medications or insulin on time. Eat right, and don't skip meals."], [876, "Type 1 Diabetes: Living With Complicatio...", "If it is not controlled, diabetes can cause a host of complications that can affect nearly every organ in the body. Diabetes complications include: Heart disease Stroke Kidney disease Nerve damage Eye damage Digestion problems Erectile dysfunction Skin problems Infection Dental problems Heart disease is one of the most common diabetes complications. In office visits, your doctor may perform various tests to check for heart disease and help you prevent any serious heart-related problems. Signs and symptoms of stroke include sudden weakness on one side of the face or body; numbness in the face, arm, or leg; difficulty speaking; trouble seeing with both eyes; or dizziness. Read more about the warning signs of stroke and also be aware of ways to prevent this serious problem from happening to you. If you have diabetes, urine testing should be performed yearly to look for diabetic nephropathy -- kidney disease. Your health care provider will also check your blood pressure regularly, because control of high blood pressure is essential in slowing kidney disease. Read about other symptoms of kidney disease in this health topic, such as persistent leg or feet swelling. Over time, diabetes can cause nerve damage that produces symptoms of numbness, burning, or pain. To protect your vision, all people with diabetes should see an ophthalmologist (an eye doctor) at least yearly. As part of the eye exam the doctor will dilate your eyes so that he or she can see the back of the eye (retina) and determine if the diabetes is causing damage. In people with type 1 diabetes, these annual exams should start within three to five years of diabetes once the patient is age 10 or older. People with type 2 diabetes should have their first eye exam once they are diagnosed. Women with diabetes who become pregnant should have a comprehensive eye exam during the first trimester and close follow-up with an eye doctor during their pregnancy. Ask for information on early warning signs so you can seek treatment when it is most effective. For some men, adopting a healthier lifestyle, such as quitting smoking, exercising regularly, and reducing stress, may be all that is needed to resolve erectile dysfunction. As many as a third of people with diabetes will have a skin condition related to their disease at some time in their lives. Fortunately, most skin conditions can be prevented and successfully treated if caught early. If your skin is not cared for properly with type 2 diabetes, a minor skin condition can turn into a serious problem with potentially severe consequences. Type 2 diabetes slows down your body's ability to fight infection. Common sites of infection are your bladder, kidneys, vagina, gums, feet, and skin. Early treatment of infections can prevent more serious complications. People with diabetes face a higher than normal risk of serious dental and oral health problems. The more uncontrolled the blood sugar, the more likely dental and oral health problems will arise. This is because uncontrolled diabetes impairs white blood cells, which are the body's main defense against infections that can occur in the mouth. See your dentist for regular cleanings and checkups to prevent serious dental problems."], [877, "Type 1 Diabetes: Children Living With th...", "For information about type 1 diabetes in adults and about preventing complications from type 1 diabetes, see the topic Type 1 Diabetes. Your body needs insulin to let sugar (glucose) move from the blood into the body's cells, where it can be used for energy or stored for later use. Without insulin, the sugar cannot get into the cells to do its work. This can cause high blood sugar levels. Your child can live a long, healthy life by learning to manage his or her diabetes. Let your child do as much of the care as possible. At the same time, give your child the support and guidance he or she needs. The key to managing diabetes is to keep blood sugar levels in a target range. To do this, your child needs to take insulin, eat about the same amount of carbohydrate at each meal, and exercise. Part of your child's daily routine also includes checking his or her blood sugar levels at certain times, as advised by your doctor. The longer a person has diabetes, the more likely he or she is to have problems, such as diseases of the eyes, heart, blood vessels, nerves, and kidneys. For some reason, children seem protected from these problems during childhood. But if your child can control his or her blood sugar levels every day, it may help prevent problems later on. Even when you are careful and do all the right things, your child can have problems with low or high blood sugar. Teach your child to look for signs of low and high blood sugar and to know what to do if this happens. If your child has low blood sugar, he or she may sweat a lot and feel weak, shaky, or hungry. Low blood sugar happens quickly. A person can get low blood sugar within minutes after exercise or after taking insulin without eating enough. If your child has high blood sugar, he or she may be very thirsty or hungry, have to urinate more often than usual, or have blurry vision. High blood sugar usually develops slowly over hours or days. Young children can't tell if they have low blood sugar as well as adults can. Also, after your child has had diabetes for a long time, he or she may not notice low blood sugar symptoms anymore. This raises the chance that your child could have low blood sugar emergencies. If you are worried about your child's blood sugar, do a home blood sugar test. Both low and high blood sugar can cause problems and need to be treated. Your doctor will suggest how often your child's blood sugar should be checked. See your child's doctor at least every 3 to 6 months to check how well the treatment is working. During these visits, the doctor will do some tests to see if your child's blood sugar is under control. Based on these results, the doctor may change your child's treatment plan. When your child is 10 years old or starts puberty, he or she will start having exams and tests to look for any problems from diabetes. Your child's insulin dose and possibly the types of insulin may change over time. The way your child takes insulin (with shots or an insulin pump) also may change. What and how much food your child needs will also change over the years. But it will always be important to eat about the same amount of carbohydrate at each meal. Carbohydrate is the nutrient that most affects blood sugar."], [878, "Type 1 Diabetes", "Type 1 diabetes happens when your immune system destroys cells in your pancreas called beta cells. It's similar to type 1, except the immune system doesn't destroy your beta cells. They're wiped out by something else, like a disease or an injury to your pancreas. Insulin is a hormone that helps move sugar, or glucose, into your body's tissues. Damage to beta cells from type 1 diabetes throws the process off. Instead it builds up in your blood and your cells starve. This causes high blood sugar, which can lead to: Dehydration. A large amount of water goes out with that urine, causing your body to dry out. That's why many people with high blood sugar lose weight. But your body can't use it without insulin, so it builds up in your blood, along with the acidic ketones. Over time, high glucose levels in your blood can harm the nerves and small blood vessels in your eyes, kidneys, and heart. They can also make you more likely to get hardening of the arteries, or atherosclerosis, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. Only about 5% of people with diabetes have type 1. Doctors don't know all the things that lead to type 1 diabetes. They also know type 1 diabetes can result when something in the environment, like a virus, tells your immune system to go after your pancreas. Most people with type 1 diabetes have signs of this attack, called autoantibodies. They're present in almost everyone who has the condition when their blood sugar is high. Type 1 diabetes can happen along with other autoimmune diseases, like Grave's disease or vitiligo. They include: Heavy thirst Increased hunger (especially after eating) Dry mouth Nausea and vomiting Pain in your belly Frequent urination Unexplained weight loss (even though you're eating and feel hungry) Fatigue (weak, tired feeling) Blurred vision Heavy, labored breathing (your doctor will call this Kussmaul respiration) Frequent infections of the skin, urinary tract, or vagina Signs of an emergency with type 1 diabetes include: Shaking and confusion Rapid breathing Fruity smell to your breath Pain in your belly Loss of consciousness (rare) If your doctor thinks you have type 1 diabetes, he'll check your blood sugar levels. He may test your urine for glucose or chemicals your body makes when you don't have enough insulin. Right now there's no way to prevent type 1 diabetes. Many people with type 1 diabetes live long, healthy lives. The key to good health is to keep your blood sugar levels within the range your doctor gives you. You'll need to check them often and adjust insulin, food, and activities to make that happen. All people with type 1 diabetes must use insulin injections to control their blood sugar. When your doctor talks about insulin, he'll mention three main things: \"Onset\" is the length of time before it reaches your bloodstream and begins lowering blood sugar. \"Peak time\" is the time when insulin is doing the most work in terms of lowering blood sugar. It peaks around 1 hour after you take it and continues to work for 2 to 4 hours. Your doctor may start you out with two injections a day of two different types of insulin. You draw it out with a syringe that has a needle on the end, and give yourself the shot. Your doctor will help you to pick the type and the delivery method that's best for you. Exercise is an important part of treating type 1. You have to balance your insulin dose and the food you eat with any activity, even simple tasks around the house or yard. Check your blood sugar before, during, and after an activity to find out how it affects you. You can lower your insulin or have a snack with carbs to prevent it from dropping too low. If your test is high, test for ketones -- acids that can result from high sugar levels. You'll also need to understand how food affects your blood sugar. Once you know the roles that carbs, fats, and protein play, you can build a healthy eating plan that helps keep your levels where they should be. If you don't keep your type 1 diabetes well controlled, you could set yourself up for serious or life-threatening problems: Retinopathy. This eye problem happens in about 80% of adults who have had type 1 diabetes for more than 15 years. To prevent it -- and keep your eyesight -- keep good control of blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides. About 20% to 30% of people with type 1 diabetes get a condition called nephropathy. It's most likely to show up 15 to 25 years after the onset of diabetes. Damaged nerves and hardened arteries lead to a loss of sensation in and a lack of blood supply to your feet. This raises your chances of injury and makes it harder for open sores and wounds to heal. Nerve damage can also cause digestive problems like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea."], [879, "Twin Twin Transfusion Syndrome", "Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a rare disorder that sometimes occurs when women are pregnant with identical (monozygotic) twins. However, in twin-twin transfusion syndrome, the blood begins to flow unevenly, with one fetal twin receiving too much blood (recipient) and one receiving too little (donor). The recipient twin may experience heart failure due to continual strain on its heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular system). The donor twin, on the other hand, may experience life-threatening anemia, insufficient nutrition and oxygen due to its inadequate supply of blood. The effects of twin-twin transfusion syndrome can vary in severity from case to case, depending upon when during pregnancy the syndrome occurs, when it is diagnosed, and any treatment that may be given."], [880, "Turner-Kieser Syndrome", "Although the symptoms and physical characteristics associated with NPS may vary, characteristic abnormalities tend to include improper development (dysplasia) of the fingernails and toenails; absence (aplasia) and/or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the knee caps (patellae); underdevelopment of certain bones and/or webbing of skin at the bend of the elbow(s); and/or abnormal projections of bone from the upper (superior) portion of both sides of the hipbone (bilateral iliac horns). The condition results due to progressive blockage of the outflow of fluid (aqueous humor) from the front chamber of the eyes (open-angle glaucoma). Without appropriate treatment, the gradual increase in fluid pressure may cause increased narrowing of visual fields and eventual blindness. For example, in some affected individuals, the inner margin (pupillary margin) of the colored portion of the eyes (irides) may appear abnormally dark (hyperpigmentation) and \"cloverleaf shaped\" (Lester iris).

They aren't cancer, but they can cause problems where they're growing. There are treatments available that can shrink the tumors and make you more comfortable. You might get TSC in certain parts of your body, and TSC might affect someone else differently. The tumors can look like thick or light patches on your skin, and if they're in your lungs, they can cause breathing problems. Treatments can help you manage your symptoms and live an independent life. You get TSC because of a problem in your genes. For most people, it's caused by changes that happened when your cells were first coming together or when you were just an embryo. Your symptoms depend on how many tumors you have, how big they are, and where they are. When you have TSC, all of that can change throughout your life. Tumors in a kidney can stop it from working like it should. They can also cause bleeding inside your body or high blood pressure. Tumors in your heart usually happen when you're young, and they shrink over time. But they can block blood flow or cause problems with your heart rhythm. Lung tumors can make you short of breath, even after mild exercise. They can also cause a cough or make your lung collapse. Tumors in your brain could cause: Seizures, which can be mild at first Behavior changes, such as temper tantrums, anxiety, or sleep problems Nausea or headaches Problems such as autism and developmental delays Tumors in your eyes can make you see double or give you blurry vision. In other places in your body, you may have patches of different color skin and dark or light growths that might look like warts. In your mouth, tuberous sclerosis can weaken the enamel on your teeth or make your gums overgrow. With so many different symptoms, diagnosing this condition can be tricky. Your doctor will talk with you before doing any testing, asking questions such as: What did you notice that brought you here today? Does anyone else in your family have seizures or epilepsy? Your doctor may check your eyes and skin, as well as ask you to get imaging tests. This series of X-rays creates detailed pictures of your body to check for tumors and other changes related to the disease. This makes a more detailed image than CT. An MRI scan can show how blood and spinal fluid are flowing, and can help pinpoint locations of tumors and other changes. That helps them see changes faster and clearer. It shows tumors and other changes in the heart. If TSC is affecting your kidneys, doctors may be able to block or reduce blood flow to kidney tumors, or give you drugs to help shrink them. At some point, you may also need dialysis or a kidney transplant. If you have tumors in your brain, sometimes drugs can shrink them, or surgeons can remove them. The drug Afinitor (everolimus) is approved by the FDA to treat specific types of brain and kidney tumors caused by TSC, too. When a child with seizures gets treated, it helps their brain develop, and he can learn better. Some people with lung problems from TSC take the drug sirolimus, which works on your immune system, or the hormone progesterone. Laser treatment (dermabrasion) can help \"refinish,\" or smooth your skin before tumors become large. Having a disease like TSC can be tough, so find ways to reduce your stress and keep doing the things you love. Pay close attention to changes in your body, and tell your doctor about them. Keep up with your treatment, and make regular visits to your doctor, letting them know about anything that concerns you. Hearing from other people and families who face similar challenges can help you understand what's going on and make you feel connected. If you feel overwhelmed or depressed, ask your doctor if he can recommend a therapist or counselor who can help you. Although there isn't a cure for TSC, your doctors can help you avoid problems.

It can also spread to other parts of the body, like the brain and spine. You have to take meds for at least 6 to 9 months. When someone who's sick coughs, sneezes, talks, laughs, or sings, tiny droplets that contain the germs are released. TB is contagious, but it's not easy to catch. You can't get the disease from shaking hands with someone who has it, or by sharing their food or drink. There are two forms of the disease: Latent TB: You have the germs in your body, but your immune system stops them from spreading. But the infection is still alive in your body and can one day become active. If you are at high risk for re-activation -- for instance, you have HIV, your primary infection was in the last 2 years, your chest X-ray is abnormal, or you are immunocompromised --- your doctor will treat you with antibiotics to lower the risk for developing active TB. Active TB disease: This means the germs multiply and can make you sick. Ninety percent of adult cases of active TB are from the reactivation of a latent TB infection. But there are usually signs if you have active TB disease. They include: A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks Chest pain Coughing up blood Feeling tired all the time Night sweats Chills Fever Loss of appetite Weight loss If you experience any of these symptoms, see your doctor to get tested. You're more likely to get TB if you come into contact with others who have it. Here are some situations that could increase your risk: A friend, co-worker, or family member has active TB disease. You live or have traveled to an area where TB is common, like Russia, Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. You're part of a group where TB is more likely to spread, or you work or live with someone who is. A healthy immune system fights the TB bacteria. But if you have any of the following, you might not be able to fend off active TB disease: HIV or AIDS Diabetes Severe kidney disease Head and neck cancers Cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy Low body weight and malnutrition Medications for organ transplants Certain drugs to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and psoriasis Babies and young children also are at greater risk, because their immune systems aren't fully formed."], [887, "Tubal Pregnancy", "In a normal pregnancy, a fertilized egg travels through a fallopian tube to the uterus. But in an ectopic pregnancy , the fertilized egg attaches (or implants) someplace other than the uterus, most often in the fallopian tube. In rare cases, the egg implants in an ovary, the cervix, or the belly. There is no way to save an ectopic pregnancy. If the egg keeps growing in the fallopian tube, it can damage or burst the tube and cause heavy bleeding that could be deadly. If you have an ectopic pregnancy, you will need quick treatment to end it before it causes dangerous problems. An ectopic pregnancy is often caused by damage to the fallopian tubes. A fertilized egg may have trouble passing through a damaged tube, causing the egg to implant and grow in the tube. Things that make you more likely to have fallopian tube damage and an ectopic pregnancy include: Smoking. The more you smoke, the higher your risk of an ectopic pregnancy. This is often the result of an infection such as chlamydia or gonorrhea. Endometriosis, which can cause scar tissue in or around the fallopian tubes. In the first few weeks, an ectopic pregnancy usually causes the same symptoms as a normal pregnancy, such as a missed menstrual period, fatigue, nausea, and sore breasts. The key signs of an ectopic pregnancy are: Pelvic or belly pain. If you think you are pregnant and you have these symptoms, see your doctor right away. To find out if you have an ectopic pregnancy, your doctor will likely do: A pelvic exam to check the size of your uterus and feel for growths or tenderness in your belly. During early pregnancy, the level of this hormone doubles every 2 days. Low levels suggest a problem, such as ectopic pregnancy. With ultrasound, a doctor can usually see a pregnancy in the uterus 6 weeks after your last menstrual period. In most cases, a doctor will treat an ectopic pregnancy right away to prevent harm to the woman. Medicine can be used if the pregnancy is found early, before the tube is damaged. In most cases, one or more shots of a medicine called methotrexate will end the pregnancy. Taking the shot lets you avoid surgery, but it can cause side effects. For a pregnancy that has gone beyond the first few weeks, surgery is safer and more likely to work than medicine. Losing a pregnancy is always hard, no matter how early it happened. If you have symptoms of depression that last for more than a couple of weeks, be sure to tell your doctor so you can get the help you need. It is common to worry about your fertility after an ectopic pregnancy. Having an ectopic pregnancy does not mean that you can't have a normal pregnancy in the future. If you get pregnant again, be sure your doctor knows that you had an ectopic pregnancy before. Regular testing in the first weeks of pregnancy can find a problem early or let you know that the pregnancy is normal. How does a doctor diagnose an ectopic pregnancy?

Evidence suggests that, in many cases, associated symptoms and findings may be relatively similar among affected infants despite differing lengths of the trisomic (duplicated) segment of 9p.

Children who have Down syndrome tend to have certain features, such as a flat face and a short neck. But with care and support, children who have Down syndrome can grow up to have healthy, happy, productive lives. Down syndrome is caused by a problem with a baby's chromosomes. Normally, a person has 46 chromosomes. But most people with Down syndrome have 47 chromosomes. In rare cases, other chromosome problems cause Down syndrome. Experts don't know the exact cause, but some things increase the chance that you'll have a baby with Down syndrome. Your risk of having a baby with Down syndrome is higher if: You are older when you get pregnant. Many doctors believe that the risk increases for women age 35 and older. You have a brother or sister who has Down syndrome. You had another baby with Down syndrome. If you've had a baby with Down syndrome and are planning another pregnancy, you may want to talk to your doctor about genetic counseling. Most children with Down syndrome have: Distinctive facial features, such as a flat face, small ears, slanting eyes, and a small mouth. Many children with Down syndrome are also born with heart, intestine, ear, or breathing problems. Your doctor may suggest that you have tests during pregnancy to find out if your baby has Down syndrome. You may decide to have: Screening tests, such as an ultrasound or a blood test during your first or second trimester. These can help show if the developing baby (fetus) is at risk for Down syndrome. These can show if a baby has Down syndrome. You may want to have these tests if you have abnormal results from a screening test or if you are worried about Down syndrome. A doctor may have a good idea that a baby has Down syndrome based on the way the baby looks and the results of a physical exam. It may take 2 to 3 weeks to get the test results. Starting soon after birth, a baby with Down syndrome will be tested for health problems, such as eye, ear, or thyroid problems. For example, most children with Down syndrome need speech therapy and physical therapy. Teens and adults with Down syndrome may need occupational therapy to learn job skills and learn how to live on their own. Counseling may help with social skills and emotional issues. To help your child: Learn all you can about Down syndrome. Find out what type of financial help you can get by contacting your state's Department of Developmental Disabilities. For example, many states provide free early-intervention programs for children with Down syndrome up to age 3 to help them get off to a good start. Federal law requires public schools to provide services to all children with disabilities who are ages 3 to 21. Raising a child with Down syndrome has both challenges and rewards. Talking to other parents who are raising children with Down syndrome can be a big help. Ask your doctor or hospital about parent support groups, or contact a group like the National Down Syndrome Congress. What increases my risk for having a baby with Down syndrome? Which tests during pregnancy check for Down syndrome? What health problems are related to Down syndrome?"], [894, "Trisomy 18 Syndrome", "Trisomy 18 syndrome is a rare chromosomal disorder in which all or a critical region of chromosome 18 appears three times (trisomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. Depending on the specific location of the duplicated (trisomic) portion of chromosome 18--as well as the percentage of cells containing the abnormality--symptoms and findings may be extremely variable from case to case. Individuals with trisomy 18 syndrome may also have distinctive malformations of the head and facial (craniofacial) area, such as a prominent back portion of the head; low-set, malformed ears; an abnormally small jaw (micrognathia); a small mouth with an unusually narrow roof (palate); and an upturned nose. Malformations of the hands and feet are also often present, including overlapped, flexed fingers; webbing of the second and third toes; and a deformity in which the heels are turned inward and the soles are flexed (clubfeet [talipes equinovarus]). Infants with trisomy 18 syndrome may also have a small pelvis with limited movements of the hips, a short breastbone (sternum), kidney malformations, and structural heart (cardiac) defects at birth (congenital)."], [895, "Trisomy 14 Mosaic", "Chromosome 14, Trisomy Mosaic is a rare chromosomal disorder in which chromosome 14 appears three times (trisomy) rather than twice in some cells of the body. The disorder may be characterized by growth delays before birth (intrauterine growth retardation); failure to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive) during infancy; delays in the acquisition of skills requiring the coordination of mental and physical abilities (psychomotor delays); and mental retardation. Affected infants also have distinctive abnormalities of the head and facial (craniofacial) region, such as a prominent forehead; deeply set, widely spaced eyes; a broad nasal bridge; and low-set, malformed ears. Additional craniofacial abnormalities may include an unusually small lower jaw (micrognathia); a large mouth and thick lips; and incomplete closure or abnormally high arching of the roof of the mouth (palate)."], [896, "Trisomy 13 Syndrome", "In individuals with Trisomy 13 Syndrome, the range and severity of associated symptoms and findings may depend on the specific location of the duplicated (trisomic) portion of chromosome 1, as well as the percentage of cells containing the abnormality. However, in many affected infants and children, such abnormalities may include developmental delays, profound mental retardation, unusually small eyes (microphthalmia), an abnormal groove in the upper lip (cleft lip), incomplete closure of the roof of the mouth (cleft palate), undescended testes (cryptorchidism) in affected males, and extra (supernumerary) fingers and toes (polydactyly). Additional malformations of the head and facial (craniofacial) area may also be present, such as a relatively small head (microcephaly) with a sloping forehead; a broad, flat nose; widely set eyes (ocular hypertelorism); vertical skin folds covering the eyes; inner corners (epicanthal folds); scalp defects; and malformed, low-set ears. For example, characteristic heart defects may include an abnormal opening in the partition dividing the upper or lower chambers of the heart (atrial or ventricular septal defects) or persistence of the fetal opening between the two major arteries (aorta, pulmonary artery) emerging from the heart (patent ductus arteriosus). Many infants with Trisomy 13 Syndrome fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive) and have severe feeding difficulties, diminished muscle tone (hypotonia), and episodes in which there is temporary cessation of spontaneous berathing (apnea)."], [897, "Trisomy 11q, Partial", "Chromosome 11, Partial Trisomy 11q is a rare chromosomal disorder in which the end (distal) portion of the long arm (q) of the 11th chromosome appears three times (trisomy) rather than twice in cells of the body.

These are some of the ways people can get it: Insect bites, especially from a deer fly or tick Coming into contact with the skin, hair, or meat of an animal that's infected Consuming contaminated water or food, such as undercooked meat Breathing in bacteria that comes up from the soil during an activity like construction or gardening It's also possible to become infected if you're exposed to the bacteria in a laboratory setting, or potentially, in an act of bioterrorism. Tularemia can happen anywhere in the world, but it's most common in rural areas where animals are more likely to be infected with the bacteria. The way you become infected with the disease influences the type of symptoms you'll have and how severe they may be. But just because you're exposed to the bacteria doesn't mean you'll become sick with the disease. If you do become sick after being exposed to Francisella tularensis, you're likely to start having symptoms within 3 to 5 days, but it can take up to 2 weeks. Symptoms can include: An ulcer on the skin that's usually caused by a bite from an infected animal or insect Lymph glands that are painful and swollen Fever Chills Headache Fatigue Oculoglandular tularemia affects the eyes. Symptoms can include: Pain, swelling, or discharge in the eye Redness in the eye Light sensitivity An ulcer that forms inside the eyelid Tender lymph glands around the ear, neck, and jaw Oropharyngeal tularemia affects the mouth, throat, and digestive system. It's the form of the disease that's most often caused by eating undercooked meat from a wild animal or drinking water that's contaminated. Symptoms can include: Throat pain Vomiting Diarrhea Swollen tonsils or lymph nodes in the neck Ulcers in the mouth Fever Pneumonic tularemia can cause symptoms that are often associated with pneumonia, including: Trouble breathing Pain in the chest A dry cough Typhoidal tularemia is a rare, but very serious form of the disease. People get it most from tick bites or contact with a contaminated animal. The following can also increase your risk for developing tularemia: Jobs such as laboratory worker, farmer, veterinarian, hunter, landscaper, wildlife manager, and meat handler Living in or visiting the south-central United States Hunting or gardening. Wild animals may be infected with tularemia, and stirring up soil may cause bacteria to be released. If you have complications like pneumonia or meningitis, you'll also need treatment for these conditions. Usually people who have had tularemia become immune to it, but some people get it more than once. You can protect yourself by: Not using bare hands to skin or dress wild animals Avoiding sick or dead animals Wearing clothing that covers exposed skin (tight at the wrists and ankles) Using insect repellents Removing ticks promptly Drinking clean water Fully cooking wild meats"], [899, "Trisomy", "Childhood leukemia, the most common type of cancer in children and teens, is a cancer of the white blood cells. Abnormal white blood cells form in the bone marrow. As tough as it is for a child to have cancer, it's good to know that most children and teens with childhood leukemia can be successfully treated. Doctors don't know exactly what causes most cases of childhood leukemia. Keep in mind, though, that having one of these things does not necessarily mean a child will get leukemia. The risk for childhood leukemia increases if your child has: An inherited disorder such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Down syndrome, or Klinefelter syndrome An inherited immune system problem such as ataxia telangiectasia A brother or sister with leukemia, especially an identical twin A history of being exposed to high levels of radiation, chemotherapy, or chemicals such as benzene (a solvent) A history of immune system suppression, such as for an organ transplant Although the risk is small, doctors say children who have things that make leukemia more likely should get regular checkups to spot any problems early. Almost all cases of childhood leukemia are acute, which means they develop rapidly. Types of childhood leukemia include: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), also called acute lymphocytic leukemia. AML is the next most common type of childhood leukemia. This is a good thing, because it means the disease may be found earlier than it otherwise would. Many signs and symptoms of childhood leukemia happen when leukemia cells crowd out normal cells. Common symptoms include: Fatigue or pale skin Infections and fever Easy bleeding or bruising Extreme fatigue or weakness Shortness of breath Coughing Other symptoms may include: Bone or joint pain Swelling in the abdomen, face, arms, underarms, sides of neck, or groin Swelling above the collarbone Loss of appetite or weight loss Headaches, seizures, balance problems, or abnormal vision Vomiting Rashes Gum problems To diagnose childhood leukemia, the doctor will take a thorough medical history and do a physical exam. Initial tests may include: Blood tests to measure the number of blood cells and see how they appear Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, usually taken from the pelvic bone, to confirm a diagnosis of leukemia Lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, to check for spread of leukemia cells in the fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord A pathologist examines cells from the blood tests under a microscope. This specialist also checks bone marrow samples for the number of blood-forming cells and fat cells. Other tests may be done to help determine which type of leukemia your child may have. Have an honest talk with your child's doctor and other members of the cancer care team about the best options for your child. Treatment depends mainly upon the type of leukemia as well as other things. The survival rates for most types of childhood leukemia have gone up over time. Childhood cancers tend to respond to treatment better than adult cancers do, and children's bodies often tolerate treatment better. For example, changes in blood cells can lead to infections or severe bleeding and may affect the amount of oxygen reaching the body's tissues. Treatment may involve antibiotics, blood transfusions, or other measures to fight infection. Your child will get anticancer drugs by mouth, or into a vein or the spinal fluid. To keep leukemia from returning, there may be maintenance therapy in cycles over a period of 2 or 3 years. Effective for certain types of childhood leukemia, targeted therapy often has less severe side effects. It can also help prevent or treat the spread of leukemia to other parts of the body. If standard treatment is likely to be less effective, a stem cell transplant may be the best option. It involves a transplant of blood-forming stem cells after whole body radiation combined with high-dose chemotherapy happens first to destroy the child's bone marrow. The FDA has approved a type of gene therapy for children and young adults up to age 25 whose B-cell ALL doesn't get better with other treatments. Scientists are working on a version of this treatment for people over 25 and for other kinds of cancer. Doctors take the cells out of your blood and change them by adding new genes."], [900, "Trismus Pseudocamptodactyly Syndrome", "Trismus-Pseudocamptodactyly Syndrome is a very rare inherited disorder characterized by the inability to completely open the mouth (trismus), causing difficulty with chewing (mastication) and/or the presence of abnormally short muscle-tendon units in the fingers, causing the fingers to curve or bend (camptodactyly) when the hand is bent back at the wrist (dorsiflexion). Because the fingers are not permanently bent or curved, this particular finding is termed \"pseudocamptodactyly\" (pseudo meaning false). In addition, the muscle-tendon units of the forearms and/or the legs may also be abnormally short, resulting in limited movements and various deformities of the feet."], [901, "Triploid Syndrome", "Individuals with triploid syndrome have three of every chromosome for a total of sixty-nine rather than the normal forty-six chromosomes.

For information on what to expect during pregnancy, labor, and childbirth, see the topic Pregnancy. A multiple pregnancy means that a woman has two or more babies in her uterus. These babies can come from the same egg or from different eggs. Babies that come from the same egg are called identical. This happens when one egg is fertilized by one sperm. The fertilized egg then splits into two or more embryos. It isn't related to your age, race, or family history. Probably will have the same body type and the same color skin, hair, and eyes. This happens when two or more eggs are fertilized by different sperm. This means that if anyone in your family has had fraternal twins, you're more likely to have them too. May look different from each other or may look the same, as some brothers and sisters do. See a picture of identical and fraternal babies in the uterus . If you take fertility drugs or have in vitro fertilization to help you get pregnant, you're more likely to have a multiple pregnancy. Fertility drugs help your body make several eggs at a time. This increases the chance that more than one of your eggs will be fertilized. When in vitro fertilization is used to help a woman get pregnant, the doctor may put several fertilized eggs in the uterus to increase the chances of having at least one baby. You're also more likely to have more than one baby at a time if: You're age 35 or older. But the chance of having serious problems increases with each baby you carry at the same time. If you're pregnant with more than one baby, you may be more likely to: Develop a problem that causes your blood pressure to get too high (preeclampsia). Develop a type of diabetes that can occur while you're pregnant (gestational diabetes). When babies are born too early, their organs haven't had a chance to fully form. This means that you may lose one or more of your babies. Have a baby born with a birth defect that occurs when something is wrong with the genes or chromosomes. Certain genetic disorders may be more likely to occur in multiple pregnancies. Keep in mind that these problems may or may not happen to you. Every day, women who are pregnant with more than one baby have healthy pregnancies and have healthy babies. While you may feel like you're carrying more than one baby, only your doctor can say for sure. This test can give your doctor a clear picture of how many babies are in your uterus and how well they're doing. If the test shows that you're carrying more than one baby, you'll need to have more ultrasounds during your pregnancy. Your doctor will use these tests to check for any signs of problems that your babies may have as they grow. If you're pregnant with more than one baby, you'll need to see your doctor more often than you would if you were having just one baby. This is because you and your babies have a greater chance of developing serious health problems. Your doctor will do a physical exam at each visit. Your doctor may also do a fetal ultrasound, check your blood pressure, and test your blood and urine for any signs of problems. The thought of having more than one baby may be scary, but it doesn't have to be. The best thing you can do is take care of yourself. While you're pregnant, be sure to: Go to every doctor's appointment. Take in plenty of calories from foods rich in folic acid, iron, and calcium. If you're not able to eat enough because of severe morning sickness, call your doctor. Avoid using any medicines, vitamins, or herbs unless your doctor says it's okay. Talk to your doctor about what activities are okay for you to do while you're pregnant. Get a lot of rest. After your babies are born, you may feel overwhelmed and tired.

They may pull out their hair when they're stressed as a way to try to soothe themselves. Besides repeated hair pulling, other symptoms may include: Feeling tense before pulling hair or when trying to resist the urge to pull hair Feeling relieved, satisfied, or pleased after acting on the impulse to pull hair Distress or problems in work or social life due to hair pulling Bare patches where the hair has been pulled out Behaviors such as inspecting the hair root, twirling the hair, pulling the hair between the teeth, chewing on hair, or eating hair Many people who have trichotillomania try to deny they have a problem and may attempt to hide their hair loss by wearing hats, scarves, and false eyelashes and eyebrows. It may be related to abnormalities in brain pathways that link areas involved in emotional regulation, movement, habit formation, and impulse control. Trichotillomania is diagnosed based on the presence of its signs and symptoms. A doctor might refer someone who has symptoms of trichotillomania to a psychiatrist or psychologist, who can interview the person and see if they might have an impulse control disorder. With this approach, people with trichotillomania first learn to identify when and where they have the urge to pull hair. They also learn to relax and do something else, that doesn't hurt them, as a way to help ease tension when they feel the urge to pull their hair. It might be as simple as making a fist with the hand that they would use to pull out the hair. Atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine or aripiprazole also may sometimes be used, either alone or in combination with an SSRI. The hair loss and skin damage can lead to problems with self-esteem and body image. In extreme cases, some people might avoid social situations in order to hide the hair loss.

Trich raises the chances that you could get or spread other STDS including HIV. Typically, trich is passed between the penis and vagina, and it doesn't matter if a man ejaculates or not -- it can be spread just through contact. Women who have sex with women can also get trich because it can spread through vaginal contact, as well. Women typically get the infection in their vulva, vagina, cervix, or urethra. Men usually get it just inside their penis in the urethra, but they may also get it in their prostate. You don't typically get it in other parts of your body, such as your hands, mouth, or anus. That also means you can get it from someone who doesn't have any symptoms. The only way you can totally prevent trich is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex. But you can take some steps to lower your chances of getting it: Always use latex condoms, and use them the right way. This helps, but won't totally protect you because trich can infect areas that a condom doesn't cover. Also, because you can get trich just through contact, make sure to put the condom on early, before it touches the vagina. When you douche, you remove some of those helpful bacteria, which can raise your chances of getting an STD. If you don't get it treated, trich can cause some other issues. Trich can also increase your risk of getting or spreading other STDs including HIV. And if you already have HIV, trich may make you more likely to pass it to someone else. Because of this risk, doctors suggest that women with HIV get tested for trich at least once a year. Your baby may also have a low birth weight, which can raise the chances that your baby will have health or developmental problems.

Tremor may be seen as involuntary shaking or trembling of the affected area. In some cases, affected individuals may also develop a variety of non-motor symptoms including cognitive impairment or personality changes. The cause of ET is most likely multifactorial, which means that several factors, such as genetic and environmental ones, all play a role in the development of the disorder. Introduction Traditionally, ET was viewed as a relatively benign disorder characterized by one symptom, tremor. In addition, researchers have determined that additional non-motor symptoms can be associated with the disorder. Some researchers now believe that essential tremor may actually represent a group of similar, yet distinct, disorders sharing the common trait of kinetic tremor."], [915, "Tremor", "Tremor is an involuntary shaking movement that is repeated over and over. Although it may affect any part of the body, tremor most often affects the hands and head. Sometimes the feet or torso may also shake. Tremors can also be caused by conditions or medicines that affect the nervous system, including Parkinson's disease, liver failure, alcoholism, mercury or arsenic poisoning, lithium, and certain antidepressants. Side effects from other medicines can also cause tremors. There are some differences between essential tremor and tremor caused by Parkinson's disease. If a cause is discovered, the disease will be treated rather than the tremor."], [916, "Traveler's Diarrhea", "Traveler's diarrhea is a stomach and intestinal infection that occurs as a result of unsanitary handling of food. Areas where there is the highest risk of contracting traveler's diarrhea include the developing countries of Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia. The risk of infection varies depending on the type of eating establishment visited -- from fairly low risk in private homes to high risk in food from street vendors. The typical symptoms of traveler's diarrhea include: Abrupt onset of diarrhea Fever Nausea and vomiting Bloating Urgent need to have a bowel movement Malaise (weakness or discomfort) Explosive and painful gas Cramps Loss of appetite Traveler's diarrhea usually lasts from 3 to 7 days and is rarely life threatening. As with all diseases, it is best to consult a doctor rather than attempting to self-medicate for traveler's diarrhea. Pepto-Bismol (2 ounces four times daily or two tablets four times daily) decreases the diarrhea and shortens the duration of the illness. This medication also appears to be effective in preventing traveler's diarrhea, but it should not be taken for more than three weeks at a time. Side effects of Pepto-Bismol can include temporary blackening of tongue and stools, occasional nausea, constipation, and rarely, ringing in the ears. Do not take Pepto-Bismol if you have an aspirin allergy, renal insufficiency, gout, or if you are taking anticoagulants, probenecid (Benemid, Probalan), or methotrexate (Rheumatrex). Treatment also requires the replacement of fluids and salts lost from diarrhea. This is best achieved by use of an oral rehydration solution such as the World Health Organization oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution. ORS is prepared by adding one packet to boiled or treated water. Antibiotics such as doxycycline, Bactrim, Septra, and Cipro or norfloxacin may shorten the length of illness. The CDC does not recommend the use of antibiotics to prevent traveler's diarrhea, because they can sometimes cause additional problems. It is important for an infected person to consult a doctor about treating diarrhea in children and infants, because some of the drugs mentioned above are not recommended for children. Again, the best treatment for dehydration is the ORS solution. Older children receiving semisolid or solid foods should continue to receive usual foods if they have diarrhea. Immediate medical attention is required if an infant with diarrhea develops signs of moderate to severe dehydration (including dry mouth, eyes, and skin; confusion; sunken eyes; and fever, bloody diarrhea, persistent vomiting, or fever higher than 102 F). Seek medical help for traveler's diarrhea if: Diarrhea is severe, bloody, or does not resolve within a few days Diarrhea is accompanied by fever and chills You are unable to keep fluids down to prevent dehydration In areas with poor sanitation, only the following beverages may be safe to drink: boiled water, hot beverages (such as coffee or tea) made with boiled water, canned or bottled carbonated beverages, beer, and wine. It is safer to drink from an unopened can or bottle than from a container that is not known to be clean and dry. Therefore, the area of a can or bottle that will touch the mouth should be wiped clean and dried. Boiling is the most reliable method to make water safe to drink. If the water is cloudy, strain it through a clean cloth and double the number of disinfectant tablets added. If the water is very cold, either warm it or allow increased time for the disinfectant to work. Adding a pinch of salt or pouring water from one container to another will improve the taste. As a last resort, if no source of safe drinking water is available, tap water that is uncomfortably hot to the touch may be safer than cold tap water. However, many disease-causing organisms can survive the usual temperature reached by the hot water in overseas hotels and boiling or proper disinfection is still advised. Foods you should avoid include: Salads Uncooked vegetables and fruit. Some fish is not guaranteed to be safe, even when cooked, because of the presence of toxins in its flesh. Seafood from the islands of the West Indies and the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans should be avoided, as it is more likely to contain toxins."], [917, "Travel Health", "The best way to stay healthy on your trip is to plan before you go.

Influenza or complications of pneumonia (pneumococcal vaccine). Polio, if you are traveling to areas where polio is common. Childhood infections, if they are not up-to-date for you and your children. These include shots for polio, diphtheria, measles, mumps, whooping cough, and rubella. Rabies, if you may be handling or near animals in parts of the world where rabies is common. If you plan to visit an area where malaria is common, start taking medicine ahead of time to prevent malaria infection. For example, find out if the water is safe to drink or if you need to worry about malaria. Basic safety can prevent some problems: Developing countries may not have safe tap water. Wear long pants and long-sleeved shirts, especially from dusk to dawn. If you drive, be sure to learn the custom and rules. If you use hired drivers (such as in a taxi), don't be afraid to ask your driver to slow down or to drive more carefully. If you become seriously ill while traveling, your country's embassy or consulate can help you find medical care. If you become ill with a fever or flu-like illness while traveling in malaria-risk areas, get medical help right away. But see a doctor if diarrhea lasts longer than 7 days, or if you have a high fever, blood or mucus in your diarrhea, or signs of dehydration. If you were healthy during your trip and you feel well when you return home, you probably don't need to see a doctor.

Some people will have obvious symptoms of a concussion, such as passing out or forgetting what happened right before the injury. It's important to know that after a concussion the brain is more sensitive to damage. In rare cases, concussions cause more serious problems. Repeated concussions or a severe concussion may lead to long-lasting problems with movement, learning, or speaking. Because of the small chance of serious problems, it is important to contact a doctor if you or someone you know has symptoms of a concussion. But if your head or your body is hit hard, your brain can crash into your skull and be injured. There are many ways to get a concussion. Concussions can also happen while participating in any sport or activity such as football, boxing, hockey, soccer, skiing, or snowboarding. You don't have to pass out (lose consciousness) to have a concussion. Symptoms of a concussion range from mild to severe and can last for hours, days, weeks, or even months. If you notice any symptoms of a concussion, contact your doctor. Symptoms of a concussion fit into four main categories: Thinking and remembering Not thinking clearly Feeling slowed down Not being able to concentrate Not being able to remember new information Not thinking clearly Feeling slowed down Not being able to concentrate Not being able to remember new information Physical Nausea and vomiting Headache Fuzzy or blurry vision Dizziness Sensitivity to light or noise Balance problems Feeling tired or having no energy Nausea and vomiting Headache Fuzzy or blurry vision Dizziness Sensitivity to light or noise Balance problems Feeling tired or having no energy Emotional and mood Easily upset or angered Sad Nervous or anxious More emotional Easily upset or angered Sad Nervous or anxious More emotional Sleep Sleeping more than usual Sleeping less than usual Having a hard time falling asleep Sleeping more than usual Sleeping less than usual Having a hard time falling asleep Young children can have the same symptoms of a concussion as older children and adults. But sometimes it can be hard to tell if a small child has a concussion. Young children may also have symptoms like: Crying more than usual. Changes in the way they nurse, eat, or sleep. Being upset easily or having more temper tantrums. Lack of interest in their usual activities or favorite toys. Loss of new skills, such as toilet training. Loss of balance and trouble walking. Concussions in older adults can also be dangerous. This is because concussions in older adults are often missed. If you are caring for an older adult who has had a fall, check him or her for symptoms of a concussion. Signs of a serious problem include a headache that gets worse or increasing confusion or both. If you are caring for an older adult who takes blood thinners-warfarin (Coumadin) is an example-and who has had a fall, take him or her to a doctor right away, even if you don't see any symptoms of a concussion. Sometimes after a concussion you may feel as if you are not functioning as well as you did before the injury. New symptoms may develop, or you may continue to be bothered by symptoms from the injury, such as: Changes in your ability to think, concentrate, or remember. Changes in your sleep patterns, such as not being able to sleep or sleeping all the time. Changes in your personality such as becoming angry or anxious for no clear reason. If you have symptoms of postconcussive syndrome, call your doctor. Any person who may have had a concussion needs to see a doctor. If a doctor thinks that you have a concussion, he or she will ask questions about the injury. Then the doctor will check your strength, balance, coordination, reflexes, and sensation. Neuropsychological tests have become more widely used after a concussion. These tests are only one of many ways that your doctor can find out how well you are thinking and remembering after a concussion. These tests can also show if you have any changes in emotions or mood after a concussion. Sometimes a doctor will order imaging tests such as a CT scan or an MRI to make sure your brain is not bruised or bleeding. After being seen by a doctor, some people have to stay in the hospital to be watched. Call or seek emergency care right away if you are watching a person after a concussion and the person has: A headache that gets worse or does not go away. Repeated vomiting or nausea. Warning signs in children are the same as those listed above for adults. Take your child to the emergency department if he or she has any of the warnings signs listed above or: Will not stop crying. It is also important to call your doctor if you are not improving as expected or if you think that you are getting worse instead of better. Here are some tips to help you get better: Get plenty of sleep at night, and take it easy during the day. Use ice or a cold pack on any swelling for 10 to 20 minutes at a time. Put a thin cloth between the ice and your skin. Your doctor may give you a prescription for pain medicine or recommend you use a pain medicine that you can buy without a prescription, such as acetaminophen (for example, Tylenol). A person who might have a concussion needs to immediately stop any kind of activity or sport. Being active again too soon increases the person's risk of having a more serious brain injury. Reduce your chances of getting a concussion: Wear a seat belt every time you drive or ride in a car or other motor vehicle. Never drive when you are under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Wear a helmet for any activity that can cause a fall or impact to the head or neck. Reduce your child's chances of getting a concussion: Use child car seats and booster seats correctly. Teach your child how to be safe around streets and cars."], [919, "Trapezoidocephaly-Multiple Synostosis Syndrome", "Antley-Bixler Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is primarily characterized by distinctive malformations of the head and facial (craniofacial) area and additional skeletal abnormalities. Many affected infants and children also may have a prominent forehead, underdeveloped midfacial regions (midfacial hypoplasia), protruding eyes (proptosis), and other craniofacial abnormalities. Additional skeletal malformations are usually present, such as fusion of certain adjacent bones of the arms (e.g., radiohumeral or radioulnar synostosis), long, thin fingers and toes (arachnodactyly), and bowing of the thigh bones. In addition, certain joints may become permanently flexed or extended in fixed postures (joint contractures), resulting in restricted movements."], [920, "Transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy", "TTR-FAP is a disease that affects your nervous system. It causes too much of a protein called amyloid to build up in your body's organs and tissues. It's a progressive disease, which means it gets worse over time. The only treatment that can stop the progress of TTR-FAP and help you live longer is a liver transplant. But there are other treatments, including medicine and changes in your diet, that can help ease many of the symptoms. It's important to reach out to family and friends to talk about any worries you have and get the emotional support you need. When you have TTR-FAP, you may develop a variety of symptoms when too much amyloid protein starts to collect in the nerves that branch out from your brain and spinal cord. For instance, you may be less likely to feel pain or heat, or have trouble walking. This protein also gathers in the nerves that control important actions in your body, like blood pressure, heart rate, and digestion. You may have trouble going to the bathroom or having sex, or you may sweat too much. As the name suggests, transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy runs in families. Because TTR-FAP can affect a number of organs and systems in your body, it can have a lot of different symptoms. The most serious problems are heart enlargement and irregular heartbeats, the cause of death in many people with TTR-FAP. You might have numbness, tingling, and swelling in your hands and feet. Or you could have problems like diarrhea, constipation, feeling full as soon as you start eating, and trouble peeing. Some eye problems you could get include: Cloudiness Dry eyes Increased pressure in the eye (glaucoma) If you know that TTR-FAP runs in your family, your doctor will probably suggest you get a DNA test to see if you have the gene that causes it. Your doctor will ask you about your health history to get clues, including: Have you or anyone in your family had heart failure or thickening of the heart muscle? Your doctor may want to do tests related to symptoms you have, too, especially for your nerves and heart. These simple lab tests will sometimes show if there's too much protein in your body. This is the main test to diagnose TTR-FAP. Your doctor will take a little bit of tissue from your body, often a small piece of fat from your belly or side. The doctor numbs the skin on your stomach and uses a needle to pull out some fat cells. The goal of some treatment is to ease the symptoms that are caused when too much amyloid gathers in your organs. For instance, if you're having problems with your heart or kidneys, you may have a buildup of fluid in your body. Your doctor may prescribe a pill that helps you get rid of unneeded water. There are also medications you can take if you have digestive problems such as diarrhea or a feeling of fullness. Researchers are working to develop new drugs that get at the source of your symptoms by preventing amyloid deposits from forming. One drug, tafamidis, is approved in Europe to treat TTR-FAP but not in the U.S. Another drug, diflunisal, is an anti-inflammatory that has been used to treat arthritis and has been shown in some studies to help keep the amyloid deposits from forming. Most of the amyloid proteins that cause TTR-FAP are made in the liver, so your doctor may suggest you get a liver transplant. If your doctor recommends a liver transplant, it's best to have it done in the early stages of the disease, before protein deposits have done too much damage to your nerves or heart. If you already have complications from TTR-FAP, such as heart, digestive, or eye problems, these problems often progress even after you get a liver transplant. Your new liver will come from someone who recently died and has the same blood type and a similar body size as yours. You may need to stay in the hospital for up to 3 weeks after your surgery. It could take you 6 months to a year before you can return to your regular lifestyle. After your transplant, you'll need to take drugs that prevent your body from rejecting the new liver. If you're considering a transplant, you'll need a lot of emotional support. Ask your doctor about support groups that have people facing the same concerns as you. If you have digestive problems, you may want to change your diet. For heart or kidney problems, you may want to: Cut back on salt, to help keep swelling in check. Try a warm-water foot massager before bed to help with tingling and burning in your feet. Although the disease continues to progress, some TTR-FAP symptoms can be controlled and treated. A liver transplant can stop your symptoms from getting worse, and it's the only treatment that can add years to your life. Studies show that 75% of people with TTR-FAP who get it live 5 years or more after the surgery. Transplants are less successful if you've already had too much damage to your nerves and your heart from the disease. If that's the case, your disease may get worse even with a new liver. It's important to turn to family and friends for support to help you keep up the best possible quality of life."], [921, "Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)", "Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a therapy that uses low-voltage electrical current for pain relief. The electrodes are often placed on the area of pain or at a pressure point, creating a circuit of electrical impulses that travels along nerve fibers. Another theory is that the electrical stimulation of the nerves may help the body to produce natural painkillers called endorphins, which may block the perception of pain. You can set the TENS machine for different wavelength frequencies, such as a steady flow of electrical current or a burst of electrical current, and for intensity of electrical current. People use TENS to relieve pain for several different types of illnesses and conditions. They use it most often to treat muscle, joint, or bone problems that occur with illnesses such as osteoarthritis or fibromyalgia, or for conditions such as low back pain, neck pain, tendinitis, or bursitis. People have also used TENS to treat sudden (acute) pain, such as labor pain, and long-lasting (chronic) pain, such as cancer pain. Although TENS may help relieve pain for some people, its effectiveness has not been proved. Have your physical therapist or doctor show you the proper way to use the machine, and follow these instructions carefully."], [922, "Tracheoesophageal Fistula", "Esophageal atresia (EA) is a rare birth defect in which the esophagus (the tube that connects the throat with the stomach) does not develop normally. In infants with EA, the esophagus is usually separated into two parts, an upper and lower segment. EA often occurs in association with a tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), which is an abnormal passage or connection (fistula) between the esophagus and the trachea (windpipe). The trachea is the tube that runs from the voice box in the throat to the lungs (bronchi), and carries air to and from the lungs. EA/TEF can occur as isolated findings (nonsyndromic), associated with other birth defects (non-isolated), or as part of a larger syndrome."], [923, "Toxoplasmosis", "The infection can cause cysts to form in your body, usually in your brain and muscles, including your heart. But if your immune system is healthy, it isn't likely to cause you any trouble. It's more likely to cause problems in people whose immune systems aren't at full strength because of a health problem like HIV, or some types of cancer or cancer treatments. It also can be harmful to babies as they develop in the womb -- a pregnant woman can pass it to her baby. You might come into contact with the parasite if you: Clean out a cat's litter box Drink water that has the parasite in it Eat raw or under-cooked meat Use utensils that have touched raw meat You also could be exposed to it if you're an organ donor or have had a blood transfusion. They include: Headaches Body aches Fever Feeling more tired than usual If your immune system isn't working like it should because of another health problem, you also may have more serious symptoms, such as: Confusion Lack of coordination Seizures Trouble breathing Blurred vision If you have signs of toxoplasmosis, see your doctor. You also might want to talk with him about it if you want to get pregnant or you have a health problem that affects your immune system. If you have the infection, your body will make things called antibodies to try to fight it off. To find out if you have toxoplasmosis, your doctor can do a blood test to see if you have those antibodies in your system. So even if your test doesn't show any signs of them, your doctor may want to do another test a few weeks later to be sure. If the blood test shows you do have the antibodies, you're likely in for another test. If so, more tests can be done on your blood to find out when the infection started. If you find out you have toxoplasmosis while you're pregnant, your doctor will want to see if it has passed to your baby. She may recommend one of these: Ultrasound: This uses sound waves to make images of the baby. Amniocentesis: Your doctor will use a long, thin needle to take a small bit of fluid from the area around the baby (the amniotic sac). Toxoplasmosis doesn't cause problems for most people, so you probably won't need treatment for it if your immune system is healthy. If you have HIV or AIDS, your doctor may recommend the antibiotic sulfadiazine, along with a medication usually used to treat malaria. For a pregnant woman whose baby hasn't been affected, the doctor might prescribe an antibiotic called spiramycin. If your baby is also infected or is likely to be, the doctor may recommend sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine, but only after the 16th week of pregnancy. You can do a few things to keep from coming into contact with the parasite: Wear gloves and wash your hands thoroughly after working outdoors or in a garden. Make sure food is cooked well, fruit and vegetables are thoroughly washed, and any water you drink has been treated. If you have a cat, here are few tips to make sure you and your family are safe around your feline friend: Keep your cat indoors so it doesn't pick up the parasite. Wear gloves when you clean the litter box, and wash your hands with soap and warm water."], [924, "Toxocaral Larva Migrans", "Toxocariasis is an infectious disease caused by the parasite Toxocara, a worm of dogs and cats. For unknown reasons, humans become infected when exposed to the eggs passed only by dogs. Infection occurs when there is purposeful or incidental ingestion of soil from hand to mouth through such activities as biting finger nails or inserting recently contaminated objects such as toys into the mouth. Once ingested, the eggs hatch into larvae and burrow into body tissue of all types. The symptoms experienced depend on the number of eggs ingested and the person's immune status, yet a single egg has the potential of causing blindness."], [925, "Toxic Shock Syndrome", "It's caused by the release of poisonous substances from an overgrowth of bacteria called Staphylococcus aureus, or staph, which is found in many women's bodies. The body responds with a sharp drop in blood pressure that deprives organs of oxygen and can lead to death. This disease made headlines in the late 1970s and early 1980s after the deaths of several young women who were using a brand of super-absorbent tampon that was later removed from the market. And it can happen to men and women who have been exposed to staph bacteria while recovering from surgery, a burn, an open wound, or the use of a prosthetic device. More than a third of all cases of toxic shock involve women under 19, and up to 30% of women who have had the disease will get it again. If you have ever had toxic shock, you must look out for the symptoms so you can get immediate medical care. If you are using a tampon, menstrual sponge, diaphragm, or cervical cap when you become ill, remove it immediately, even before calling your doctor. This bacteria is one of several staph bacteria that cause skin infections in burn patients and hospital patients who have had surgery. But two conditions are necessary: First, the bacteria need an environment in which they can grow rapidly and release poisons. Polyester foam provides a better environment for the growth of bacteria than either cotton or rayon fibers. In cases from menstrual sponges, diaphragms, and cervical caps, either the device had been in the vagina for a long time -- more than 30 hours -- or, in the case of the sponge, pieces of the sponge remained in the vagina. Sliding a tampon into place in the vagina may make microscopic tears in the walls of the vagina, rupturing tiny blood vessels. A super-absorbent tampon -- especially if it's left in place too long, or if it is used when the menstrual flow is light -- can dry out the vagina, making such tearing even more likely. Researchers investigating the causes of toxic shock syndrome have ruled out feminine deodorant sprays and douches, underwear, and other clothing. The condition is also unrelated to the woman's menstrual history, drug or alcohol use, cigarette smoking, swimming or bathing, or sexual activity."], [926, "Toxic Paralytic Anemia", "Summary Acquired aplastic anemia is a rare disorder caused by profound, almost complete bone marrow failure. The bone marrow produces specialized cells (hematopoietic stem cells) that grow and eventually develop into red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes), and platelets. In acquired aplastic anemia, an almost complete absence of hematopoietic stem cells eventually results in low levels of red and white blood cells and platelets (pancytopenia). Specific symptoms associated with acquired aplastic anemia may vary, but include fatigue, chronic infections, dizziness, weakness, headaches, and episodes of bleeding, usually in the skin and mucous membranes. Although some cases of acquired aplastic anemia occurs secondary to other disorders, researchers now believe that most cases result from a disorder of the patient's immune system, which mistakenly targets the bone marrow (autoimmunity). Furthermore, some aplastic anemia that is genetically inherited may, first manifest in adulthood, without a family history of blood disease."], [927, "Townes Brocks Syndrome", "Townes-Brocks syndrome (TBS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by absence of the anal opening (imperforate anus), abnormal ears associated with hearing impairment and thumb malformations. Townes-Brocks syndrome is associated with a mutation in the SALL1 gene."], [928, "Tourette's syndrome", "Tourette's syndrome is a problem with the nervous system that causes people to make sudden movements or sounds, called tics, that they can't control. For example, someone with Tourette's might blink or clear their throat over and over again. Treatments can control tics, but some people don't need any unless their symptoms really bother them. About 100,000 Americans have full-blown Tourette's syndrome, but more people have a milder form of the disease. Tourette's has been linked to different parts of the brain, including an area called the basal ganglia, which helps control body movements. Researchers think the trouble in this brain network may play a role in Tourette's. Doctors don't know exactly what causes these problems in the brain, but genes probably play a role. People who have family members with Tourette's are more likely to get it themselves. The more severe ones can be embarrassing and can affect your social life or work. A simple tic affects one or just a few parts of the body, like blinking the eyes or making a face. Before a motor tic, you may get a sensation that can feel like a tingle or tension. You might be able to hold your tics back for a little while, but you probably can't stop them from happening. Doctors aren't sure why, but about half of people with Tourette's also have symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). You may have trouble paying attention, sitting still, and finishing tasks. Tourette's can also cause problems with: Anxiety Learning disabilities such as dyslexia Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) -- thoughts and behaviors you can't control, like washing your hands over and over again If you or your child has symptoms of Tourette's, your doctor may want you to see a neurologist, a specialist who treats diseases of the nervous system. There aren't any tests for the condition, but he'll ask you questions, like: What did you notice that brought you here today? Do you often move your body in a way you can't control? Your doctor may do imaging tests of your brain to rule out other conditions that have symptoms like those of Tourette's. It uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of organs and structures inside your body. It's a powerful X-ray that makes detailed images of your insides. If your child has Tourette's, you may also want to ask how long his tics might last or what you can do to help him deal with his symptoms at home and at school. Many times, tics are mild and don't need to be treated. If they become a problem, your doctor may prescribe medicine to help them. It can take a while to find the right dose that helps control tics but avoids side effects, so be patient as you and your doctor work through it. Medications can include: Haloperidol (Haldol), fluphenazine (Prolixin), and pimozide (Orap), which work on a brain chemical called dopamine to control tics. Clonidine (Catapres) and guanfacine (Tenex, Intuniv)), high blood pressure drugs that can also treat tics. Fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft), and other antidepressants, which can relieve anxiety, sadness, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Along with medicine, you may want to consider talk therapy. A psychologist or counselor can help you learn how to deal with the social issues your tics and other symptoms may cause. A specific kind, called habit-reversal training, teaches you how to recognize that a tic is coming and then move in a way that stops it. Often the hardest part of living with Tourette's is dealing with the embarrassment or frustration of having tics you can't control. While you're getting help from your doctor, you can do a few other things to feel better: Get support. Your family, friends, health care team, or a support group can help you meet the challenges of Tourette's. Read a book, listen to music, meditate, or do yoga. Low-key activities you enjoy can combat the stress that can lead to tics. Learn everything you can about your condition so you'll know what to do when you have symptoms. If your child has Tourette's, talk to his school about it. You can give staff the facts about the condition and see what kind of support they can give him, like extra tutoring or smaller classes. Fitting in socially also can be hard for a child with the disease. A few will have them for the rest of their lives, but their symptoms may get better as they get older.

Cervical dystonia typically begins in middle age, and rarely begins in adolescence and young adulthood.

Rotator cuff disorders occur when tissues in the shoulder get irritated or damaged. Rotator cuff disorders include: Inflammation of the tendons (tendinitis) or of a bursa (bursitis). In the shoulder, a bursa is a small, fluid-filled sac that serves as a cushion between the tendons and the bones. Calcium buildup in the tendons, which causes a painful condition called calcific tendinitis. Partial or complete tears of the rotator cuff tendons . The shoulder is a joint with three main bones: the upper arm bone (humerus), the collarbone (clavicle), and the shoulder blade (scapula). The rotator cuff keeps the upper arm bone in the shoulder socket and lets you raise and twist your arm. This socket is shallow, which lets you move your arm in a wide range of motion. But it also means that the muscles and tendons of the rotator cuff have to work hard to hold the bones in place. Most rotator cuff disorders are caused by a combination of: Normal wear and tear. Using your shoulder for many years slowly damages the rotator cuff. As you age, everyday activities can lead to changes in the rotator cuff, such as thinning and fraying of the tendons and reduced blood supply. Activities in which you use your arms above your head a lot-such as tennis, swimming, or house painting-can lead to rotator cuff problems. Even normal motions made often over a long period can stress or injure the rotator cuff. It takes great force to tear a healthy rotator cuff tendon. But even a simple movement like lifting a suitcase can cause a rotator cuff tear in an older adult or someone whose shoulder is already damaged. Symptoms of a rotator cuff disorder include pain and weakness in the shoulder. Most often, the pain is on the side and front of the upper arm and shoulder. You may have pain during the night and trouble sleeping. To diagnose a rotator cuff disorder, doctors ask about any shoulder injuries or past shoulder pain. They also do a physical exam to see how well the shoulder works and to find painful areas or activities. Moving your arm in certain ways can help a doctor learn about the condition of the rotator cuff. If the diagnosis is still unclear, the doctor may order an imaging test, such as an MRI or an ultrasound. Without treatment, your shoulder may get weaker and you may not be able to lift up your arm. For most rotator cuff disorders, doctors recommend these steps first: Rest the shoulder. Don't keep the shoulder still with a sling or brace. This can lead to stiffness or even a frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis). Use ice or heat on the shoulder, whichever feels better. Physical therapy can reduce pain and help make your shoulder stronger and more flexible. In physical therapy, you learn exercises to stretch and strengthen your shoulder. If other treatments don't help, your doctor may give you shots of steroid medicine in the shoulder. The shots probably don't cure rotator cuff disorders. But they can help relieve pain and inflammation so you are able to do exercises to strengthen the shoulder. The shots may also help your doctor find out if your shoulder pain is from your rotator cuff. If a steroid shot near the rotator cuff relieves your pain, even if the pain comes back later, it means the rotator cuff-not some other shoulder problem-is causing the pain. Most rotator cuff disorders aren't treated with surgery. But doctors may do surgery if a rotator cuff tendon is torn or if several months of other treatments have not helped. Surgery may be a good choice if you are young and your rotator cuff has been in good shape. Even after surgery, you may need months of physical therapy to have a full recovery.

Can rotator cuff disorders lead to other problems?"], [935, "Transverse Myelitis", "Transverse myelitis is an inflammation of the spinal cord that happens when the coverings that protect nerve cells in a certain area of your spinal cord are damaged. This makes it hard for those nerves to send signals to other parts of your body. About 1,400 people a year get transverse myelitis, and about 33,000 people have some sort of disability as a result of it. It's often the first sign of the chronic nerve disorder multiple sclerosis, or MS. The nerve fibers in cells that take messages between your brain and your body are protected by a fatty tissue called myelin. When this happens to the nerves on both sides of part of your spinal cord, it's known as transverse myelitis. For about 60% of people with transverse myelitis, doctors aren't sure of the cause. In other cases, transverse myelitis may be linked to other conditions. For instance, there appears to be a connection between transverse myelitis and autoimmune conditions, such as: Multiple sclerosis Neuromyelitis optica Systemic lupus erythematosus Sjogren's syndrome Sarcoidosis Other problems that may lead to transverse myelitis are: Viral, bacterial, or fungal infections Parasites Certain vascular disorders The early symptoms of transverse myelitis usually include: Pain in your lower back Sharp pain that moves down your legs and arms or around your chest and belly Weakness or paralysis in your legs or arms Sensitivity to touch to the point where slight fingertip pressure causes pain Numbness or a pins-and-needles feeling in your toes, feet, or legs Problems controlling your bladder or bowels Muscle spasms Fever Loss of appetite Once they start, the symptoms can get worse within hours. At that point, about half the people who get transverse myelitis lose control of their legs. Most have some numbness, tingling, or a burning sensation in their back, belly, arms, or legs. If you have symptoms, your doctor will run some tests to figure out if you have transverse myelitis or some other condition. These will show whether there's something like a tumor or a slipped disk in your backbone, or whether the channel that holds the spinal cord has gotten narrow and is affecting the nerves. Spinal tap: Your doctor puts a needle in between two vertebrae (bones in your back) to take a sample of the fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord. Bloodwork: Your doctor will take a sample of your blood to look for signs of other illnesses that cause similar symptoms, like lupus, HIV, or another form of myelitis. And he'll try to find out if transverse myelitis is a sign of a related illness, like MS. So your doctor will try to manage the disease and ease your symptoms: She may recommend that you stay in bed while you fight the illness. You might get other drugs to relieve muscle spasms or help control your bladder or bowels. If an immune system disorder is causing your condition, you might be given drugs that slow down your body's natural defense system. This might get rid of something in it that's causing your immune system to attack your own body and keep it from damaging other organs. If your symptoms affect your breathing, you might need to be put on a respirator (a machine that helps you breathe) to make sure your body gets enough oxygen. About a third of people with transverse myelitis get better and don't have much permanent damage. They also may have muscle spasms, a less sensitive sense of touch, or trouble controlling their bladder.

These may include fever; difficulties feeding; small areas of bleeding under the skin, causing the appearance of small reddish or purplish spots; enlargement of the liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly); yellowish discoloration of the skin, whites of the eyes, and mucous membranes (jaundice); hearing impairment; abnormalities of the eyes; and/or other symptoms and findings."], [937, "Tooth Decay", "Tooth decay is the destruction of tooth structure and can affect both the enamel (the outer coating of the tooth) and the dentin layer of the tooth. Tooth decay occurs when foods containing carbohydrates (sugars and starches), such as breads, cereals, milk, soda, fruits, cakes, or candy are left on the teeth. Bacteria that live in the mouth digest these foods, turning them into acids. The bacteria, acid, food debris, and saliva combine to form plaque, which clings to the teeth. The acids in plaque dissolve the enamel surface of the teeth, creating holes in the teeth called cavities. To prevent tooth decay: Brush your teeth at least twice a day with a fluoride-containing toothpaste. Preferably, brush after each meal and especially before going to bed. Clean between your teeth daily with dental floss or interdental cleaners, such as the Oral-B Interdental Brush, Reach Stim-U-Dent, or Sulcabrush. Avoid carbohydrates such as candy, pretzels and chips, which can remain on the tooth surface. If sticky foods are eaten, brush your teeth soon afterwards.

Tonsillitis most commonly affects children between the ages of 3 and 7, when tonsils may play their most active infection-fighting role. As the child grows and the tonsils shrink, infections become less common. Ear infections and adenoid problems (swellings at the back of the nasal cavity above the tonsils) may occur at the same time. The likely viruses include those that cause the common cold, influenza (flu) viruses, and the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), which also causes mononucleosis, or \"mono.\" Tonsillitis is caused by strep throat in kids only about 30% of the time, and less so in adults. Sometimes transmission occurs by oral contact, especially in the case of EBV (which is why mono is often called \"the kissing disease\").

Speech problems, because the tip of the tongue cannot rise high enough to make some sounds clearly, such as t, d, z, s, th, n, and l. Personal or social problems related to the restricted tongue movement, such as problems cleaning food off the teeth with the tongue. In an older child or adult, the doctor may check the shape and movements of the tongue. If your baby is younger than 1 year of age and has problems with feeding, the doctor may do a medical procedure (frenotomy) to clip the lingual frenulum . While you wait and see, you can also: Talk to a lactation consultant if you are having breastfeeding problems. If tongue-tie causes speech problems or personal or social problems as your child grows, the doctor may do a frenuloplasty. In this surgery, the doctor clips the lingual frenulum and closes the wound with stitches. The doctor may also teach your child how to do tongue exercises to improve tongue movement.

The exact cause of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is not known, but the disorder is thought to be associated with inflammation of specific areas behind the eye (cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure)."], [946, "Toilet Training", "The methods that work best use positive reinforcement and begin intensive training only when a child is physically and emotionally ready. Introduce the basic concepts of toilet use gradually and repetitively to your child. As your child gains the necessary skills, he or she will show a sincere interest in using the toilet. Before you decide to start toilet training, make sure the household environment is stable and that all family members are prepared to help in the process. Trying to start potty training soon after having another child, while remodeling your home, while having a succession of household guests, right before going on vacation, or during a time of relationship problems will likely not be as successful as during a calm period when the family can focus on helping your young child reach this important developmental milestone. Talk with your child about having a bowel movement and about urinating. It is fine to use these words, but use the proper terms as well so that your child learns what they mean. Explain how the toilet works and how your child will be able to use it when he or she is ready. Talk about how he or she will no longer need to wear diapers, will get to wear underpants that are more comfortable, and can go just like a big boy or girl. You can also use books and DVDs to help prepare your child. Take your child with you to select a potty that is sturdy and comfortable. Some ways to do this are by: Letting your child move a portable potty into his or her room or other play area to get used to having it around. Helping make the potty special by personalizing it, such as painting it or writing your child's name on it. Letting your child sit on it and read a book or sit on it with his or her diaper on while having a stool or urinating. Soon you will use it just like grownups use the toilet.\" Your child may want to join you when you use the toilet. Do not try to begin toilet training before your child is physically and emotionally ready. Trying to toilet train your child before this time creates frustration for both of you. Do not scold, punish, or embarrass your child for failing to use the toilet. Do not verbally or physically force your child to sit on a potty. Allow your child to sit on the potty only for 5 minutes at a time unless he or she is beginning to pass stool or urine. When this happens, follow your child's lead and start the process. General suggestions that can make this process go more smoothly are to: Dress your child in clothing that is easy for him or her to remove. Help your child feel comfortable and safe on the toilet. A step stool also supports the feet and allows your child to push his or her feet against the stool during a bowel movement. Instruct girls to wipe from front to back, which helps avoid infection caused by getting stool near the urethra or the vagina. Many children need help to wipe effectively, especially after a bowel movement, until about age 4 or 5. You may want to keep diaper wipes near the toilet to help remove residue without chafing your child's skin. If your child has this fear, it is fine for you to flush the toilet after he or she leaves the room. Eventually, your child will be able to flush the toilet without a problem. Teach your child how to wash his or her hands after using the toilet. You can say, \"You are sitting on your potty just like mommy (or daddy, or big sister)\" or \"You are trying really hard to poop (or pee) in your potty.\" Also, remind your child to use the toilet when he or she wakes up in the morning. If you and your child are not making progress with toilet training, it's okay. Put the potty chair away until your child shows that he or she wants to try again. The most important things to remember for toilet training are to wait until your child and family are ready and to make it a positive experience."], [947, "Toe Fracture", "You may break one of your toes by stubbing it, dropping something on it, or bending it. A hairline crack (stress fracture) may occur after a sudden increase in activity, such as increased running or walking. Symptoms of a broken toe may include: A snap or pop at the time of the injury. Possible deformity (not just swelling), such as a toe pointing in the wrong direction or that is twisted out of normal position. Home care after breaking a toe includes applying ice, elevating the foot, and rest. Medical treatment for a broken toe depends on which toe is broken, where in the toe the break is, and the severity of the break. If your injured toe hurts more after buddy taping it, remove the tape. In rare cases, other treatment may be needed, including: Protecting the toe from additional injury. This may include using splints to stabilize the toe, a short leg cast, or a brace. Medical treatment is needed more often for a broken big toe than for the other toes.

Remember that no one can watch a child's every move or make a home 100% safe all the time. Try to find a balance among supervising your child, taking safety precautions, and allowing your child to explore. Learn all you can about child growth and development. Doing so can help you learn how to respond to and make a positive impact on how your child behaves. You can: Supervise your child both inside and outside the house. For example, always use a car seat, and watch your child closely when he or she interacts with pets. Practice healthy habits. Take safety measures around the home. And always place your baby to sleep on his or her back. Car seats, cribs, strollers, playpens, and high chairs are all often used by infants and toddlers up to age 2. If any of this equipment is worn or broken, or if you use it incorrectly, it can be dangerous.

In addition to neurological symptoms, affected individuals may experience eye abnormalities, disorders affecting the heart muscles (cardiomyopathy), and abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Vitamin E deficiency often occurs secondary to disorders that impair the absorption of vitamin E from fat including liver disorders, disorders of fat metabolism, and disorders of bile secretion. These disorders include cholestasis (a syndrome of various causes characterized by impaired bile secretion); cystic fibrosis (primarily a lung disorder that may also affect bile secretion); primary biliary cirrhosis (a liver disorder that results in cholestasis); and abetalipoproteinemia (a digestive disorder characterized by fat malabsorption).

Taking calcium, potassium, and magnesium supplements doesn't have the same effect as eating foods that are high in those nutrients. Don't make big changes in your diet all at once. Make small changes, and don't give up. As soon as those changes become habit, add a few more changes. You'll have more success if you make a plan that includes long-term and short-term goals as well as ideas for getting past barriers--things that might get in the way of changing your eating habits. Support from family and friends can go a long way toward helping you find success in changing your habits. Don't be afraid to let family and friends know what you're trying to do. A glass of fat-free milk has only 80 calories and no fat. Have a \"skinny\" latte (made with fat-free milk) as a way to add milk to your diet. If you don't drink coffee, try a skinny steamed milk or chai drink. Serve baked potatoes with a variety of vegetables, such as broccoli. And use other toppings, such as low-fat shredded cheese, chili, salsa, and refried beans. You could end up with 4 or 5 servings of vegetables at one meal. Eat a variety of cut-up vegetables with a low-fat dip such as hummus. Make a stir-fry with lots of different vegetables. Buy a vegetarian cookbook, and try one recipe each month or each week. Combine a ready-made pizza crust with low-fat mozzarella cheese and lots of vegetable toppings. For breakfast, have whole-grain cereal, fruit, and low-fat or fat-free milk. Make a dip for fruit from low-fat or nonfat vanilla yogurt and cinnamon. Look at menus ahead of time to find dishes you can eat and still stay on your eating plan. Find new restaurants that offer vegetarian and low-fat dishes. Remember your reason for wanting to change, think about the progress you've made, and give yourself a pep talk and a pat on the back. When you hit a barrier--and most people do--get support. Talk to your family members and friends to see if someone wants to eat healthy foods with you or cheer you on. It's motivating to know that someone is sharing the same goals. Friends and family members can eat healthy meals with you. They can encourage you by saying how they admire you for making hard changes. When you reach one of your goals, give yourself a present.

The many small spots may blend into large patchy areas, usually on the oily parts of the upper body like the chest and back. The spots can be either lighter or darker than the skin around them. Normally, regular washing and showering removes dead skin and fungi (more than one fungus). As these fungi grow in number, their natural balance on the skin is affected, the normal color of the skin changes, and spots appear. People with oily skin, especially teens and young adults, are more likely to get tinea versicolor. Other things that increase your chance of getting tinea versicolor include: Having an impaired immune system, which can occur during pregnancy or from some illnesses. Symptoms of tinea versicolor include small, flat, round or oval spots that may, over time, form patches. The spots occur on oily areas of skin on the upper chest, back, or upper arms or, less often, on the upper thighs, neck, or face. If your skin tends to get darker with sun exposure, the spots may be easier to see in the summer because they don't tan with the rest of your skin. For people whose skin is lighter during the winter, the spots may be harder to see at that time of year. The spots are flat and may be white, pink, red, tan, or brown, depending on your skin color. Your doctor often can tell if you have tinea versicolor by looking at the spots. He or she may look at a sample (scraping) of the infected skin under a microscope. The test used most often for this is the KOH test. This can show whether the problem is caused by a fungus. Products that you put on your skin (topical treatments) are the most common treatment for tinea versicolor. Depending on how strong the medicine is, you may or may not need a prescription for these products. For example, shampoos used to treat tinea versicolor usually contain selenium sulfide. They are available in 2.5% strength with a prescription and in 1% strength without a prescription (for example, Selsun Blue, Head and Shoulders). If the infection is severe, returns often, or does not get better with skin care, your doctor may prescribe antifungal pills. Pills tend to be easier for people to use than the products that you put on your skin. But it can take months for the spots to disappear and for your skin color to return to normal. Also, the infection tends to come back after treatment. If you have frequent problems with tinea versicolor, there are a couple of things you can do so that it is less likely to come back. Use antifungal skin creams, shampoos, or solutions at least once a month. Some doctors believe that fungi that remain in clothing may cause the infection to return. But for persistent tinea versicolor, you may need to dry-clean your clothes or wash them in the hottest possible water."], [952, "Tina", "Pinta is a rare infectious tropical disease affecting the skin that is caused by the bacterium Treponema carateum, which is transmitted by direct, nonsexual contact.

It is caused by infection with the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii (R. rickettsii), which is usually transmitted by a tick bite. When introduced into the body, the bacterium spreads by the bloodstream or lymphatic vessels and multiplies within and damages certain cells lining the inside of small blood (vascular) vessels (i.e., endothelial cells) as well as vascular smooth muscle cells. Such damage leads to inflammatory changes of affected blood vessels (vasculitis), leakage of fluid from the blood vessels, an abnormal accumulation of fluid in body tissues (edema), and additional abnormalities, resulting in the symptoms and findings associated with the disease. The rash often initially appears on the skin of the wrists and ankles and spreads to involve the palms of the hands, the soles of the feet, the forearms, the trunk, the buttocks, and the neck and facial areas. The rash typically initially consists of small, flat pinkish spots (macules) that eventually become raised (papules) and darker. R. rickettsii infection may affect blood vessels, tissues, and organs throughout the body, including the lungs, brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), heart, liver, and kidneys.

Removing the tick completely may help you avoid diseases such as Lyme disease that the tick may pass on during feeding, or a skin infection where the tick bit you. Use insect repellents, such as products with DEET. This may help reduce ticks and the rodents that the ticks depend on. Remove plants that attract deer, and use barriers to keep deer-and the deer ticks they may carry-out of your yard. Comb your hair with a fine-toothed comb, or have someone check your scalp. To remove ticks from clothing, put your clothes in a hot dryer or hang them out in the sun on a hot day for at least 15 minutes. Also check for ticks on any gear you had with you in the woods. Check your children daily for ticks, especially during the summer months. Your pets can carry infected ticks indoors where they might fall off your pet and attach to you. Use fine-tipped tweezers to remove a tick. If you don't have tweezers, put on gloves or cover your hands with tissue paper, then use your fingers. Grab the tick as close to its mouth (the part that is stuck in your skin) as you can. You could push infected fluid from the tick into your body if you squeeze it. This may break off the tick's body and leave the head in your skin. Put the tick in a dry jar or ziplock bag and save it in the freezer for later identification if needed. After the tick has been removed, wash the area of the tick bite with a lot of warm, clean water. NOTE: If you can't remove a tick, call your doctor. You may cover the wound with a thin layer of petroleum jelly, such as Vaseline, and a nonstick bandage. If you do not see any obvious parts of the tick's head where it bit you, assume you have removed the entire tick, but watch for symptoms of a skin infection. If you have a rash, headache, joint pain, fever, or flu-like symptoms, this could mean you have an illness related to a tick bite. Do not try to: Smother a tick that is stuck to your skin with petroleum jelly, nail polish, gasoline, or rubbing alcohol. Smothering or burning a tick could make it release fluid-which could be infected-into your body and increase your chance of infection.

Most ticks don't carry diseases, and most tick bites don't cause serious health problems. Removing the tick's body helps you avoid diseases the tick may pass on during feeding. Removing the tick's head helps prevent an infection in the skin where it bit you. See Home Treatment for the best way to remove a tick. Usually, removing the tick, washing the site of the bite, and watching for signs of illness are all that is needed. When you have a tick bite, it is important to determine whether you need a tetanus shot to prevent tetanus (lockjaw). Some people may have an allergic reaction to a tick bite.

TN type 1 (TN1) is characterized by attacks of intense, stabbing pain affecting the mouth, cheek, nose, and/or other areas on one side of the face. TN type 2 (TN2) is characterized by less intense pain, but a constant dull aching or burning pain. If untreated, TN can have a profound effect on a person's quality of life. In most cases, TN1 develops due to a blood vessel pressing against the trigeminal nerve, but sometimes no underlying cause can be identified (idiopathic). TN2 can be idiopathic, due to compression of the trigeminal nerve, or can occur due to a known underlying cause such as a tumor or multiple sclerosis. It is not known why one person gets symptoms of TN1 versus TN2; it may be due to the number of vessels (e.g. However the term \"atypical\" trigeminal neuralgia has been inconsistently used for individuals who do not have TN1 and remains a vague, undefined term. Consequently, many researchers and patients have advocated eliminating the term \"atypical TN\", which remains a \"wastebasket\" diagnosis that serves no useful purpose and is often a disservice to patients.

A low birth weight and signs of brain injury or an enlarged section of the brain. The tics may not be obvious. They can be bursts of movement or sounds that last for seconds or minutes. It's common for a person who has Tourette's to feel an urge in some part of the body that builds and builds. A doctor can diagnose Tourette's based on your child's medical history and symptoms. The doctor may want to know if tics are causing school or social problems for your child. But in some cases an electroencephalogram (EEG), a CT scan, or blood tests may be done to check for other health problems. Your doctor may also check for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or other learning or behavior problems. It may help to identify when tics occur and what is going on in your child's life during those times. If tics are seriously affecting your child's quality of life at home or school, then counseling, behavioral therapy to reduce tics (habit reversal), and medicines may help. If your child has other medical problems, these may need to be treated first to see how they affect your child's symptoms. Despite what you might have seen in movies or on TV, most people with Tourette's disorder don't have uncontrollable outbursts of cursing or sexual behavior. As your child ages, the pattern of tics can change. Tics may come and go over weeks and months. They may also change from one kind to another. Tics may get worse and then get better. Your child may get a new tic, or an old one may come back. Your child may try to suppress tics, which may make them last longer or be worse than at other times.

After a short time, blood flows again and the symptoms go away. With a stroke, the blood flow stays blocked, and the brain has permanent damage. Some people call a TIA a mini-stroke, because the symptoms are those of a stroke but don't last long. A TIA is a warning: it means you are likely to have a stroke in the future. If you think you are having a TIA, call or other emergency services right away. If you think you have had a TIA but your symptoms have gone away, you still need to call your doctor right away. Symptoms of a TIA are the same as symptoms of a stroke. They may include: Sudden numbness, tingling, weakness, or loss of movement in your face, arm, or leg, especially on only one side of your body. A blood clot is the most common cause of a TIA. Blood clots can be the result of hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), heart attack, or abnormal heart rhythms. The clot can block blood flow to part of the brain. After the clot dissolves, blood flow returns, and the symptoms go away. Sometimes a TIA is caused by a sharp drop in blood pressure that reduces blood flow to the brain. Your doctor will do tests to look at your heart and blood vessels. You may need: Tests that show pictures of your brain and blood vessels, such as a CT scan, an MRI, a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA), or an angiogram. A test that uses sound to check your blood flow (Doppler ultrasound). An echocardiogram (echo) to check your heart's shape and its blood flow. An electrocardiogram (EKG, ECG) to measure your heart rhythm. Blood tests, including a complete blood count and a fasting blood test to check for problems that could be causing your symptoms. Your doctor will start you on medicines to help prevent a stroke. You may need to take several medicines. If tests show that the blood vessels (carotid arteries) in your neck are too narrow, you may need a procedure to open them up. This can help prevent blood clots that block blood flow to your brain. After you have had a TIA, you are at risk for having another TIA or a stroke. But you can make some important lifestyle changes that can reduce your risk of stroke and improve your overall health. Manage high blood pressure or high cholesterol by working with your doctor. Keep your blood sugar levels within a target range. If your doctor recommends that you take aspirin or a blood thinner, take it. Take your medicine exactly as prescribed. Call your doctor if you think you are having a problem with your medicine. Being overweight makes it more likely that you will develop high blood pressure, heart problems, and diabetes. Do activities that raise your heart rate.

These are symptoms of hyperthyroidism, where the thyroid gland makes too much thyroid hormone. Most people don't find thyroid nodules on their own, because the nodules aren't easy to feel and don't usually cause symptoms. Your doctor may have found a nodule on your thyroid when you were having a CT scan or ultrasound for another reason. Your doctor will do a physical exam and will ask you if you have symptoms or any changes in how you've been feeling. You may have tests to see how well your thyroid is working and to make sure the nodule is not cancer. Possible tests include: A blood test to check the level of thyroid hormone in your body. A thyroid scan, which uses radioactive material and a camera to get information about your thyroid gland and nodules. Fine-needle aspiration, which removes a small amount of material from the nodule. Thyroid ultrasound, to see the number and size of nodules or to locate the nodule for fine-needle aspiration. If your nodule is not cancer (benign) and is not causing problems, your doctor will watch your nodule closely for any changes. But if the nodule is large or causing problems with swallowing or breathing, you'll need surgery to remove the nodule. If your thyroid nodule is causing hyperthyroidism, your doctor may recommend a dose of radioactive iodine, which usually comes in a liquid that you swallow. In some cases, surgery may be done to remove an overactive thyroid nodule. If your nodule is cancer (malignant), you'll need surgery to remove the nodule. You may also need treatment with radioactive iodine to destroy any leftover cancer cells. After surgery, you may need to take thyroid medicine for the rest of your life."], [962, "Thyroid Disorders", "Although the effects can be unpleasant or uncomfortable, most thyroid problems can be managed well if properly diagnosed and treated. All types of hyperthyroidism are due to an overproduction of thyroid hormones, but the condition can occur in several ways: Graves' disease: The production of too much thyroid hormone. Toxic adenomas: Nodules develop in the thyroid gland and begin to secrete thyroid hormones, upsetting the body's chemical balance; some goiters may contain several of these nodules. Subacute thyroiditis: Inflammation of the thyroid that causes the gland to \"leak\" excess hormones, resulting in temporary hyperthyroidism that generally lasts a few weeks but may persist for months. Pituitary gland malfunctions or cancerous growths in the thyroid gland: Although rare, hyperthyroidism can also develop from these causes. Since your body's energy production requires certain amounts of thyroid hormones, a drop in hormone production leads to lower energy levels. Causes of hypothyroidism include: Hashimoto's thyroiditis : In this autoimmune disorder, the body attacks thyroid tissue. Removal of the thyroid gland: The thyroid may have been surgically removed or chemically destroyed. Exposure to excessive amounts of iodide: Cold and sinus medicines, the heart medicine amiodarone, or certain contrast dyes given before some X-rays may expose you to too much iodine.You may be at greater risk for developing hypothyroidism if you have had thyroid problems in the past. A lack of thyroid hormones in the system at an early age can lead to the development of cretinism (mental retardation) and dwarfism (stunted growth). In infants, as in adults, hypothyroidism can be due to these causes: A pituitary disorder A defective thyroid Lack of the gland entirely A hypothyroid infant is unusually inactive and quiet, has a poor appetite, and sleeps for excessively long periods of time. You might have one or more thyroid nodules for several years before they are determined to be cancerous. People who have received radiation treatment to the head and neck earlier in life, possibly as a remedy for acne, tend to have a higher-than-normal risk of developing thyroid cancer."], [963, "Thyroid Cancer", "Thyroid cancer is a disease that you get when abnormal cells begin to grow in your thyroid gland . The thyroid gland is shaped like a butterfly and is located in the front of your neck. Thyroid cancer is an uncommon type of cancer. Most people who have it do very well, because the cancer is usually found early and the treatments work well. After it is treated, thyroid cancer may come back, sometimes many years after treatment. Experts don't know what causes thyroid cancer. But like other cancers, changes in the DNA of your cells seem to play a role. People who have been exposed to a lot of radiation have a greater chance of getting thyroid cancer. A dental X-ray now and then will not increase your chance of getting thyroid cancer. But past radiation treatment of your head, neck, or chest (especially during childhood) can put you at risk of getting thyroid cancer. Thyroid cancer can cause several symptoms: You may get a lump or swelling in your neck. If you have a lump in your neck that could be thyroid cancer, your doctor may do a biopsy of your thyroid gland to check for cancer cells. A biopsy is a simple procedure in which a small piece of the thyroid tissue is removed, usually with a needle, and then checked. In this case, you may need surgery to remove all or part of your thyroid gland before you find out if you have thyroid cancer. Thyroid cancer is treated with surgery and often with radioactive iodine. It rarely needs radiation therapy or chemotherapy. What treatment you need depends on your age, the type of thyroid cancer you have, and the stage of your disease. Stage refers to how severe the disease is and how far, if at all, the cancer has spread. Talking to others who have had thyroid cancer may help. Ask your doctor about cancer support groups in your area. Most thyroid cancer cannot be prevented. One rare type of thyroid cancer, called medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), runs in families. A genetic test can tell you if you have a greater chance of getting MTC. If this test shows that you have an increased risk, you can have your thyroid gland removed to reduce your risk for thyroid cancer later in life. Can I prevent thyroid cancer? How will my doctor diagnose thyroid cancer? What happens if thyroid cancer comes back?"], [964, "Thymic Aplasia, Nezelof's", "When your body makes too much of it, the excess hormone can throw off your body's other systems. Most cases of Cushing's syndrome can be cured, though it may take some time for your symptoms to ease up. The condition, also known as hypercortisolism, is more common in women than men. You can get Cushing's syndrome when there's too much cortisol in your body for too long. Cortisol comes from your adrenal glands, which sit on top of your kidneys. The most common cause is related to medications called glucocorticoids, also commonly known as steroids or prednisone. These prescription steroids are used for conditions such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or after an organ transplant. A tumor in your pituitary gland, found at the base of the brain, or a tumor in the adrenal glands, can also prompt your body to make too much cortisol, which can lead to Cushing's. In some rare cases, though, people develop it because a problem in their genes makes them more likely to get tumors on their glands. Your case might be different than someone else's, but when the disease is full-blown, common symptoms are: Rounded, rosy face Weight gain, especially upper body A fat pad in the upper back or base of the neck (you may hear this called a \"buffalo hump\") Thin arms and legs Acne Being very tired Weak muscles, especially when using your shoulders and hip muscles High blood pressure High blood sugar levels Depression and anxiety Osteoporosis Kidney stones Sleep problems Extra hair growth on your body and face Irregular periods Low sex drive and problems having an erection Your skin could become thin, heal slowly, and bruise easily. You might get purple or pink stretch marks all over your body, especially your belly, thighs, arms, and chest. Your bones may get weak. Everyday movements like bending, lifting, or even getting out of a chair can cause backaches or breaks in your ribs or spine. Children with Cushing's syndrome are usually very heavy, what doctors call obese, and tend to grow slowly. When you go to your doctor, she'll do a physical exam and ask you questions. Your doctor will probably also recommend some of these tests to help screen for Cushing's syndrome if she suspects you have it: 24-hour urinary free cortisol test. This common test collects your urine for 24 hours to measure how much cortisol is in it. You'll take a low-dose steroid pill at 11:00 p.m. and then take a blood test in the morning to see how much cortisol your body still makes. If you have Cushing's syndrome, your doctor may refer you to a specialist who will do other blood tests or imaging scans to find out what's causing it. The first thing your doctor will figure out is why you have too much cortisol. For instance, if you have too much cortisol because you're taking steroid medicines, your doctor will check to see if you can stop taking the drugs, or take a lower dose. If a tumor is causing your Cushing's syndrome, you'll likely have other tests to determine the location of the tumor first before deciding on your treatment. If not, your doctor may be able to shrink the tumor with radiation or medicine. Eating well is an important part of living with Cushing's. A nutritionist can help you make sure you're getting enough of the right nutrients. It's OK to say no and set limits, so you keep your energy up. Your doctor may be able to give you a referral. Your symptoms and how long they'll last depend on: The amount of extra cortisol you have The cause of your high cortisol How long you've had the condition Your overall health Most of the time Cushing's syndrome can be treated and cured. If your Cushing's syndrome isn't curable, you'll want to look for ways to manage your weight gain, muscle weakness, and tiredness. Partner with your doctor on that, and tell your doctor how you're feeling. If you get depressed, it's important to get treated for that. Look for ways to connect online and in person with people who have experience with Cushing's syndrome. You can learn more about living with the condition, and meet other people who have it, in forums on the Cushing's Support &amp; Research Foundation web site."], [965, "Thumb-Sucking", "They may also suck on their fingers, hands, or items such as pacifiers. Little by little, most children stop on their own at age 3 to 6 years. But many babies continue to suck their thumbs to soothe themselves. Thumb-sucking can become a habit in babies and young children who use it to comfort themselves when they feel hungry, afraid, restless, quiet, sleepy, or bored. In rare cases, thumb-sucking after age 5 is in response to an emotional problem or other disorder, such as anxiety. Thumb-sucking in children younger than 4 is usually not a problem. Children who suck their thumbs often or with great intensity around age 4 or 5, or those who are still sucking their thumbs at age 6, are at risk for dental or speech problems. Many experts recommend ignoring thumb-sucking in a child who is preschool age or younger. Children who suck their thumbs may need treatment when they: Continue to suck a thumb often or with great intensity around age 4 or older. Develop dental or speech problems as a result of sucking their thumbs. Simple home treatment measures stop most children from sucking their thumbs. But if your child has a sucking habit around age 4 or older, schedule a visit with your child's doctor or dentist. It may help to limit the times and places that your child is allowed to suck his or her thumb and to put away blankets or other items your child associates with thumb-sucking. Putting gloves on your child's hands or wrapping the thumb with an adhesive bandage or a cloth may help remind your child not to suck the thumb. For example, put stickers on a calendar each day that your child doesn't suck his or her thumb. If home treatment doesn't work and you are concerned or feel frustrated about your child's thumb-sucking, talk with your child's doctor. There may be other treatment options, such as behavioral therapy, thumb devices, or devices for the mouth. But remember that thumb-sucking usually isn't a problem in children at preschool age or younger."], [966, "Thrush", "If you notice a strange white rash inside your mouth, you may have a condition called thrush. It's an infection caused by the candida fungus, which is yeast. You can get it in your mouth and other parts of the body. It can cause diaper rash in infants or vaginal yeast infections in women. Anyone can get thrush, but it happens most often to babies and toddlers, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems. Small amounts of the candida fungus are in your mouth, digestive tract, and skin. It's supposed to be there, and it's usually kept under control by the other bacteria in your body. But sometimes, certain illnesses or medications, like corticosteroids or antibiotics, can disturb the balance. So can a number of medical conditions, like: Uncontrolled diabetes HIV infection Cancer Dry mouth Hormonal changes that happen with pregnancy If you smoke or wear dentures that don't fit right might, you're also more likely to get thrush. White, slightly raised areas in your mouth are common signs of thrush. They can also appear on the roof of your mouth, gums, tonsils, or the back of your throat. They can be painful and may bleed slightly when you scrape them or brush your teeth. In very bad cases, they can spread into your esophagus and cause: Pain when you swallow or difficulty swallowing A feeling that food is stuck in your throat or in the middle of your chest Fever, if the infection spreads beyond the esophagus The fungus that causes thrush can spread to other parts of the body, like the lungs, liver, and skin. This happens more often in people with cancer, HIV, or other conditions that weaken the immune system. If the fungus that causes thrush spreads into your esophagus, you may have to have other tests, like: A throat culture (a swab of the back of your throat) An endoscopy of your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine X-rays of your esophagus Thrush is easy to treat in healthy children and adults. These come in tablets, lozenges, or liquids, and are generally easy to take. Since the infection can be a symptom of other medical problems, your doctor may also want to run other tests to rule these out. Even if you're healthy and don't have dental issues, you should get your teeth cleaned by your dentist every 6 months. A condition such as HIV or diabetes can disturb the balance of bacteria in your body and lead to thrush. Using any more than that may upset the normal balance of bacteria in your mouth. If you have a condition like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), clean your inhalers after each use to kill germs. Ask your doctor or dentist about ways to help you kick the habit."], [967, "Thrombophlebitis", "Thrombophlebitis is a problem with your circulation -- how fast blood moves through your veins. It happens when a blood clot slows circulation -- most commonly in your legs, but also in your arms, in some cases. \"Thrombo\" means clot, and \"phlebitis\" means inflammation in a vein. Most cases of thrombophlebitis that happen in the shallow leg veins begin to go away by themselves in a week or two. But on rare occasions, these blocked veins can lead to infection. If the clot reaches the lungs and blocks circulation there, it can lead to death. To prevent this, your doctor might put you on blood thinners. In more serious cases, your doctor may give you medication to \"melt\" the clot, cut the swelling, or treat any infection that could develop. Blood clots can also form if you've had to sit for a long time in a place where you couldn't stretch your legs, like on a long flight or drive. This allows blood to pool in the vessel instead of flowing straight through in one direction. Anyone who has poor circulation in their legs may be more likely to have this condition. And while hospital staffers try to lower this risk by changing the spots where IV lines are placed in the body, thrombophlebitis is still possible. Other things that raise your chances of developing this condition include: Having certain cancers Use of the hormone estrogen for birth control or hormone replacement Being over age 60 Obesity Smoking A family history of blood clots Catheters placed in central veins of the arm or leg If the blood flow (circulation) to one of your veins is slowed because of a clot, you might have: Red, swollen, and irritated skin around the affected area Pain or tenderness that gets worse when you put pressure on the affected area A swollen vein that feels like a tough \"cord\" under your skin Pain when flexing your ankle (keep in mind that thrombophlebitis can happen in other parts of the body, but typically occurs in the legs) Swollen foot or ankle If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor. They may also do blood and circulation tests, or imaging exams, like a CT scan or MRI. One leg seems warmer than the other or is swollen, red, painful, or irritated The affected limb becomes pale or cold, or you start feeling chills and fever Thrombophlebitis treatment depends on how bad it is. Clots lodged in veins near the surface of the skin often go away on their own in a week or two. But if you do need treatment, your doctor will probably give you something to relieve swelling and pain. If your thrombophlebitis is more severe, your doctor may give you a blood thinner. You can get some of these medications, like heparin, in the hospital through an IV. You can give others, like enoxaparin (Lovenox), to yourself through shots under your skin at home. You may also have to take an oral drug like w arfarin (Coumadin) for several months or longer to keep clots from coming back. If there's a high risk of tissue damage, or if your clot comes back, you may need surgery after the inflammation improves. If you have a clot in a deep vein in your leg, your doctor might recommend an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The IVC filter prevents clots in your legs from breaking loose and traveling to your lungs. Superficial thrombophlebitis: It's a blood clot in the vein just below surface of your skin. It doesn't usually get to your lungs, but superficial thrombophlebitis can be painful, and you may need treatment. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): It's a blood clot in a vein deep in your body. Most happen in your lower leg or thigh, but they may happen in other parts of your body. A clot like this can get loose and travel through your bloodstream. If it gets to an artery in your lungs and blocks blood flow, it's called a pulmonary embolism, which can damage your lungs and other organs and even cause death.

But if you do have symptoms like bleeding too much, treatments can help. Platelets are made in your bone marrow, the spongy tissue inside your bones. You can get thrombocytopenia if your body doesn't make enough of them, or if they're destroyed faster than they can be made. Your body might not make enough platelets if you have a: Blood disorder that affects bone marrow, called aplastic anemia Cancer such as leukemia or lymphoma, which damages your bone marrow Platelet-lowering disease that runs in your family, like Wiskott-Aldrich or May-Hegglin syndrome Virus such as chickenpox, mumps, rubella, HIV, or Epstein-Barr Chemotherapy or radiation treatment for cancer destroys stem cells that form platelets. If you've been in contact with chemicals like pesticides and arsenic, your body might slow down the process of making platelets. Your platelets can be damaged by: Autoimmune diseases such as lupus or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), where your own body attacks healthy cells Medicines, such as antibiotics that contain sulfa, heparin used to prevent blood clots, and antiseizure drugs such as phenytoin (Dilantin) and vancomycin (Vancocin) Rare diseases that make blood clots form in the body, such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) Viruses like mononucleosis or cytomegalovirus Sometimes, you don't have enough platelets because they get trapped in your spleen, an organ that fights infection. And women may get thrombocytopenia during pregnancy, because their bodies get rid of platelets more quickly than usual. You might also have: Blood in your urine or bowel movement Headaches Heavy menstrual periods Purple or red bruises, called purpura Tiny red or purple spots on your skin, called petechiae These symptoms might not start until your platelet count is very low. You'll also get an exam to look for bruises, spots of blood on your skin, and other signs of low platelets. You might get a blood test that measures the number of platelets. You might get some other tests, including: Blood smear to look at your platelets under a microscope and see how healthy they are Bone marrow test to find out how many blood cells are in it, and whether they're normal Your doctor might want you to take other tests that check if your blood clots normally. For instance, if taking a certain medicine is behind your thrombocytopenia, your doctor might switch you to another drug. For severe thrombocytopenia, you might get: Steroid medicines to stop your body from destroying platelets Blood or platelets from a healthy person, called a transfusion Surgery to remove your spleen To prevent bleeding when your platelets are low: Avoid medicines that thin your blood, like aspirin and ibuprofen. Don't play contact sports, like football or boxing, where you might get injured. Wear a seatbelt in the car, and put on gloves and goggles when you work with power tools to prevent injury."], [972, "Thrombocytopenia", "If you have thrombocytopenia, you don't have enough platelets in your blood. Platelets help your blood clot, which stops bleeding. But if you have a severe form, you can bleed too much when you're injured or spontaneously in your eyes, gums, or bladder. A healthy person usually has a platelet count of 150,000 to 400,000. If you're wondering what the long name means, here's how it breaks down: \"Thrombocytes\" are your platelets and \"penia\" means you don't have enough of something. Your doctor may tell you that you have a form of the condition called immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), which is one of the most common causes of low platelets in people who do not have symptoms. Although doctors don't know what causes ITP, they know that it happens when your immune system -- your body's main defense against disease -- doesn't work right. Your antibodies, which are supposed to attack infections, instead mistakenly destroy your platelets. Your body might have fewer platelets because of these causes: Infections Viral infections, including chickenpox, parvovirus, hepatitis C, Epstein-Barr, and HIV Sepsis, a severe bacterial infection in your blood Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), a bacteria that can live in your digestive system Medicines Medication side effects, including drugs for heart problems, seizures, and infections Heparin, a blood thinner used to prevent blood clots Chemotherapy Work with your doctor to figure out if a drug is causing your platelet count to drop.

Up to 5% of healthy women get it during pregnancy, and it usually gets better on its own after your baby is born. An enlarged spleen Your body uses too many platelets, leaving you without enough of them. That can happen if you have an autoimmune disease, like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Rare disorders like hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), [LB5] [AC6] which uses a lot of platelets to make small blood clots throughout your body. You see these mostly on your legs and feet, and they may appear in clumps. Severe thrombocytopenia can cause a lot of bleeding after an injury, such as a fall. Thrombocytopenia is often found by chance when your doctor does a routine blood test. He or she might ask you: What symptoms (including bleeding) have you noticed? Have you had any shots in the last month, a blood transfusion, or used drugs with a needle? Does anyone in your family have a problem with their immune system, bleeding, or bruising? Your doctor may do a physical exam to check you for signs of bleeding and feel if your spleen seems big. Some tests check for low platelet levels: CBC (complete blood count). This measures the number of your red and white blood cells and platelets. Your doctor uses a very fine needle to draw a small amount of liquid bone marrow and check it for cells that may not be working right. Or you may get a biopsy using a different kind of needle, so your doctor can check the types and numbers of cells in the bone marrow. You may need more tests to help your doctor figure out what's going on. There are a lot of treatment options for thrombocytopenia and ITP. You'll need to work with your doctor to weigh the pros and cons of each and find a therapy that's right for you. If you have ITP, your treatment depends on how severe a case you have. If it's mild, you may only need to get regular checks of your platelet levels. When you do need treatment, the goal is to get your platelet count to a level that's high enough to prevent serious bleeding in the gut or brain. Your doctor will likely suggest these treatments first: Corticosteroids. Doctors prescribe it to try to raise your platelet count. There are some side effects to prednisone, especially if you use it for a long time. Even after a short time, you can get irritable, have stomach upsets, and have other problems such as: Sleep problems Weight gain Puffy cheeks Need to pee often Lower bone density Acne Besides side effects, another disadvantage to prednisone is that your platelet count may drop once you've finished your treatment. If you have ITP and other treatments haven't raised your platelet levels enough, you may benefit from an operation to remove your spleen. That's the organ that destroys your platelets, so taking it out can give your platelet count a boost. Getting your spleen removed can make it harder for you to fight infections. Your infection risk is greatest in the first 3 months after your surgery. This drug is a type of treatment known as biologic therapy. It attacks B cells, a type of white blood cell that can destroy platelets. It's sometimes used if you have severe ITP despite treatment with steroids and you aren't able to have surgery to remove your spleen. Your doctor may also suggest it if you've had your spleen removed but you still have low platelet counts. Side effects for rituximab include: Fever Chills Weakness Nausea Headaches Weakened immune system IVIG (intravenous immune globulin). If you can't get your platelet count up [LB9] [AC10] with prednisone, if you cannot tolerate steroids, or if your count drops after you're done with your treatment, your doctor may suggest IVIG. You take this medication through an IV, usually for several hours a day over a period of 1 to 5 days. The advantage of IVIG is that it can raise your platelet count quickly. It is useful for people who need to get their levels boosted fast or who cannot tolerate steroids. The side effects include: Nausea and vomiting Headaches Fever, chills Rho(D) immune globulin. This treatment, which you also take through an IV, is an alternative to traditional IVIG in patients who have Rh+ blood. If corticosteroids, IVIG, and Rho D aren't improving your platelet count and you're having bleeding problems, your doctor may switch to a second set of options. They include: Thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonists. If you have severely low platelets even after treatment with steroids, surgery to remove the spleen, or rituximab, you will likely do well on these medicines, but you may need to take them long-term. Two TPO drugs are available: eltrombopag (Promacta) and romiplostim (Nplate). Side effects include nausea, vomiting, and headache, and a higher risk of blood clots. If you've tried those and still can't get your platelet count to the right level, your doctor may suggest these medicines: Immunosuppresants, such as azathioprine (Imuran), cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept). They work by keeping your immune system in check. It's not used in women because it can cause unwanted hair growth called hirsutism. Doctors sometimes suggest these if you're having severe bleeding and your platelet count isn't getting a boost from other treatments. You can still do a lot of things, but you may need to make some changes to your lifestyle to prevent getting hurt or cut. Eat a healthy diet with lots of fruits and vegetables, especially leafy greens, to give your body the nutrients it needs. Ask your doctor if you should avoid food with quinine and aspartame, like tonic water, bitter lemon, bitter melon, some diet sodas, and sugar-free foods. Ask your doctor if it's OK for you to drink alcohol, and if it is, how much.

The two other types of blood cells are red blood cells, which carry oxygen to all tissues in the body, and white blood cells, which help to fight infections. Red blood cell numbers (often measured as a percentage of whole blood, called a hematocrit) are generally normal in ET, while white blood cell numbers are normal or slightly elevated in ET. Common alternative causes of an elevated platelet count are iron deficiency, infection or generalized inflammation; less common causes are blood disorders such as ET or other related blood diseases (also see below). Introduction In the 1950's, a pioneering hematologist, William Dameshek, placed ET within a family of blood diseases called myeloproliferative disorders. These were unified by their propensity to lead to abnormal increases in various blood cells, perhaps, in Dr. Dameshek's words, \"due to a hitherto undiscovered stimulus\". Over time, it became obvious that the myeloproliferative disorders are caused by genetic accidents (an internal defect) in very early blood cells (stem cells), which are then passed along to all of the progeny of that cell, even as they mature into platelets, red cells, or white blood cells (see below)."], [974, "Thrombasthenia", "Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is a rare inherited blood clotting (coagulation) disorder characterized by the impaired function of specialized cells (platelets) that are essential for proper blood clotting.

Low levels of hemoglobin may cause anemia, an illness that makes you feel weak and tired. Severe anemia can damage organs and lead to death. You need both alpha- and beta-globin to make hemoglobin. If you have one damaged gene, you may have mild anemia and probably won't need treatment. It happens when you get a normal gene from one parent and a thalassemia gene from the other. When both genes are damaged, it means you got a thalassemia gene from each parent. If you have moderate anemia (beta thalassemia intermedia), you may need blood transfusions. People with severe anemia (called beta thalassemia major or Cooley's anemia) need blood transfusions throughout life. If you have moderate anemia (beta thalassemia intermedia), you may need blood transfusions. People with severe anemia (called beta thalassemia major or Cooley's anemia) need blood transfusions throughout life. If two genes are missing or damaged: You will have very mild anemia that will typically not need treatment. If three genes are missing: You will have mild to moderately severe anemia. If it is severe, you may need blood transfusions. If you, either parent, or any of your siblings have thalassemia or carry a gene for thalassemia and you're thinking about having a child, you may want to talk to a genetic counselor before you get pregnant. A genetic counselor can tell you how likely it is that your child will have the disease and how severe it might be. Moderate or severe disease may cause symptoms of anemia. For example, you may feel weak, tire out more easily, and feel short of breath. Other symptoms also can occur depending on how severe your disease is and what problems it causes. Children with severe thalassemia may grow slowly (failure to thrive), have skull bones that are not shaped normally, and have problems with feeding, frequent fevers, and diarrhea. Tests you may need include: A complete blood count (CBC). A blood test that measures the amounts of different types of hemoglobin, to help find out which type of thalassemia you have. If you learn that you have thalassemia, your family members should to talk to their doctors about testing. They are an excellent resource to help you and your family get the best care. Mild thalassemia, the most common form, does not need treatment. Moderate thalassemia may be treated with blood transfusions and folic acid supplements. Severe thalassemia may be treated with: Blood transfusions.Folic acid. If you have repeated blood transfusions, it's possible for your body to get too much iron. Make sure to avoid vitamins that contain iron, and don't take extra vitamin C, which can increase how much iron you absorb from food. If you have too much iron, your doctor may give you chelation therapy. Less common treatments for severe thalassemia include: A blood or bone marrow stem cell transplant. These vaccines may protect you from severe infections, which can make anemia worse and cause severe illness in people who have thalassemia."], [980, "Thalamic Hyperesthetic Anesthesia", "Summary Central pain syndrome is a neurological disorder caused by damage to the central nervous system (CNS). The specific type of pain experience can vary from one individual to another based, in part, upon the underlying cause of the disorder and the area of the central nervous system affected. Central pain syndrome can develop following a variety of conditions including stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, or brain tumors. Introduction For years, it was believed that the majority of cases of central pain syndrome were due to damage of the thalamus most often caused by a stroke. However, researchers now know that damage to other areas of the CNS can cause central pain syndrome, including cases following a stroke. Consequently, the preferred name for this group of disorders is central pain syndrome to acknowledge that damage to various areas of the CNS (and not predominantly the thalamus) can cause central pain and that a stroke is not necessarily the primary cause. The preferred term for the specific subtype of central pain syndrome caused by CNS damage due to a stroke is central post-stroke pain."], [981, "Tennis Elbow", "The term has entered wide use, though only a small group of people diagnosed with tennis elbow actually get it from playing tennis. Tennis elbow is a common injury that will usually heal with minor treatment, but you have to give it time and rest. Tennis elbow is a pain focused on the outside of the arm, where your forearm meets your elbow. When you constantly use your arm in a repetitive motion, the tendons at the elbow end of a certain muscle -- the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) muscle --- may develop small tears. The tears lead to inflammation and may put stress on the rest of your arm, making it painful to lift and grip things. Tennis elbow affects up to 3% of the population, particularly adults between 30 and 50 years of age. There's also a version golfers get called \"golfer's elbow.\" In tennis, hitting a backhand puts some stress on your forearm muscles, which repeatedly contract when you hit the ball. If you have poor technique or grip the racquet too tightly, that stress may increase in the tendons that connect the forearm muscles to the elbow. The tendons may get small tears. The more you do it -- and tennis is a game of repeated strokes -- the greater the chance for tennis elbow. You can also get it from jobs or activities that involve repetitive arm motion, such as: Tree-cutting (repetitive use of a chain saw) Painting Carpentry Playing some types of musical instruments Butchers, cooks, and assembly-line workers are among the groups that get it often. Golfer's elbow differs from tennis elbow in that the pain is focused on the inside of the elbow. But the causes are similar: tendon tears caused by repetitive movement, whether it's a golf swing, lifting weights, or simply shaking hands. Eventually, you may find it harder or more painful to grip or lift things. These include straightening your wrist against pressure and checking for pain in parts of your arm. Tennis elbow can usually be treated with exercise, physical therapy, and medications such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), and aspirin."], [982, "Tendon Sheath Adherence, Superior Obliqu...", "Brown Syndrome is a rare eye disorder characterized by defects in eye movements. This disorder may be present at birth (congenital) or may occur as the result of another underlying disorder (acquired). Some of these muscles turn the eyeball up and down, move the eyeball from side to side, or enable the eyeball to rotate slightly in its socket. The symptoms of Brown Syndrome are caused by abnormalities of this tendon sheath including shortening, thickening, or inflammation."], [983, "Tendinopathy", "The heel and elbow joints are common sites of tendon injuries. For more information about tendon injuries in these areas, see the topics Achilles Tendon Problems and Tennis Elbow. This topic does not address severe tendon tears or ruptures. To help you assess a tendon injury, see the topic Shoulder Problems and Injuries, Elbow Injuries, Knee Problems and Injuries, Finger, Hand, and Wrist Injuries, or Toe, Foot, and Ankle Injuries. For example, the Achilles tendon connects the calf muscle to the heel bone. Most tendon injuries occur near joints, such as the shoulder, elbow, knee, and ankle. A tendon injury may seem to happen suddenly, but usually it is the result of many tiny tears to the tendon that have happened over time. Doctors may use different terms to describe a tendon injury. Many doctors still use this familiar word to describe a tendon injury. Most tendon injuries are the result of gradual wear and tear to the tendon from overuse or aging. But people who make the same motions over and over in their jobs, sports, or daily activities are more likely to damage a tendon. A tendon injury can happen suddenly or little by little. You are more likely to have a sudden injury if the tendon has been weakened over time. Tendinopathy usually causes pain, stiffness, and loss of strength in the affected area. The pain may get worse when you use the tendon. You may have more pain and stiffness during the night or when you get up in the morning. You may notice a crunchy sound or feeling when you use the tendon. The symptoms of a tendon injury can be a lot like those caused by bursitis. To diagnose a tendon injury, a doctor will ask questions about your past health and your symptoms and will do a physical exam. If the injury is related to your use of a tool or sports equipment, the doctor may ask you to show how you use it. In most cases, you can treat a tendon injury at home. To get the best results, start these steps right away: Rest the painful area, and avoid any activity that makes the pain worse. Apply ice or cold packs for 10 to 15 minutes at a time, as often as 2 times an hour, for the first 72 hours. After the activity, apply ice to prevent pain and swelling. If the injury is severe or long-lasting, your doctor may have you use a splint, brace , or cast to hold the tendon still. It may take weeks or months for a tendon injury to heal. If you start using the injured tendon too soon, it can lead to more damage. To keep from hurting your tendon again, you may need to make some long-term changes to your activities. For example, if running caused the injury, try swimming some days. If the way you use a tool is the problem, try switching hands or changing your grip. If exercise caused the problem, take lessons or ask a trainer or pro to check your technique. If your job caused the tendon injury, ask your human resource department if there are other ways to do your job."], [984, "Tendinitis", "Tendinitis (also called tendonitis) is an inflammation or irritation of a tendon, a thick cord that attaches bone to muscle. Tendinitis is most often caused by repetitive, minor impact on the affected area, or from a sudden more serious injury. There are many activities that can cause tendinitis, including: Gardening Raking Carpentry Cleaning house Shoveling Painting Scrubbing Tennis Golf Skiing Throwing and pitching Incorrect posture at work or home or poor stretching or conditioning before exercise or playing sports also increases a person's risk. Other risk factors for tendinitis, include: An abnormal or poorly placed bone or joint (such as length differences in your legs or arthritis in a joint) that stresses soft-tissue structures. Tendinitis is common in \"weekend warriors,\" people that play and exercise hard only on weekends. Occasionally an infection can cause tendinitis, especially infection from a cat or dog bite to the hand or a finger. As tendons age they tolerate less stress, are less elastic, and are easier to tear. The most common places are: Base of the thumb Elbow Shoulder Hip Knee Achilles tendon The symptoms of tendinitis include: Pain at the site of the tendon and surrounding area. Pain may gradually build up or be sudden and severe, especially if calcium deposits are present. To avoid tendinitis, try these tips when performing activities: Take it slow at first. Try again later and if pain recurs, stop that activity for the day. Initial treatment of tendinitis includes: Avoiding activities that aggravate the problem Resting the injured area Icing the area the day of the injury Taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs or using topical anti-inflammatory gels If the condition does not improve in a week, see your doctor. You may need more advanced treatments, including: Corticosteroid injections. Physical therapy includes range-of-motion exercises and splinting (thumb, forearm, bands). You should see your doctor if you experience any of the following: Fever (over 100 degrees Fahrenheit) Swelling, redness, and warmth General illness or multiple sites of pain Inability to move the affected area These could be signs of another problem that needs more immediate attention."], [985, "TEN", "Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare, sometimes life-threatening unless properly treated, immunological disorder of the skin. It is characterized by blisters that meld into one another to cover a substantial portion of the body (30% and more), and extensive peeling or sloughing off of skin (exfoliation and denudation). In adults the disorder is usually caused by a reaction to taking a pharmaceutical drug, especially anticonvulsants, non-steroid anti-inflammatories, and/or some antibiotics.

TEN is considered to be the more serious, followed by Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme, in order of severity of disease."], [986, "Temporomandibular (TM) Disorders", "Your temporomandibular joint is a hinge that connects your jaw to the temporal bones of your skull, which are in front of each ear. It lets you move your jaw up and down and side to side, so you can talk, chew, and yawn. Problems with your jaw and the muscles in your face that control it are known as temporomandibular disorders (TMD). But you may hear it wrongly called TMJ, after the joint. Dentists believe symptoms arise from problems with the muscles of your jaw or with the parts of the joint itself. Injury to your jaw, the joint, or the muscles of your head and neck -- like from a heavy blow or whiplash -- can lead to TMD. Other causes include: Grinding or clenching your teeth, which puts a lot of pressure on the joint Movement of the soft cushion or disc between the ball and socket of the joint Arthritis in the joint Stress, which can cause you to tighten facial and jaw muscles or clench the teeth TMD often causes severe pain and discomfort. More women than men have it, and it's most common among people between the ages of 20 and 40. Common symptoms include: Pain or tenderness in your face, jaw joint area, neck and shoulders, and in or around the ear when you chew, speak, or open your mouth wide Problems when you try to open your mouth wide Jaws that get \"stuck\" or \"lock\" in the open- or closed-mouth position Clicking, popping, or grating sounds in the jaw joint when you open or close your mouth or chew. A tired feeling in your face Trouble chewing or a sudden uncomfortable bite -- as if the upper and lower teeth are not fitting together properly Swelling on the side of your face You may also have toothaches, headaches, neck aches, dizziness, earaches, hearing problems, upper shoulder pain, and ringing in the ears (tinnitus). Many other conditions cause similar symptoms -- like tooth decay, sinus problems, arthritis, or gum disease. To figure out what's causing yours, the dentist will ask about your health history and conduct a physical exam. He'll check your jaw joints for pain or tenderness and listen for clicks, pops, or grating sounds when you move them. He'll also make sure your jaw works like it should and doesn't lock when you open or close your mouth. Your dentist may take full face X-rays so he can view your jaws, temporomandibular joints, and teeth to rule out other problems. The MRI can show if the TMJ disc is in the proper position as your jaw moves. You may get referred to an oral surgeon (also called an oral and maxillofacial surgeon) for further care and treatment. This doctor specializes in surgery in and around the entire face, mouth, and jaw area. You may also see an orthodontist to ensure your teeth, muscles, and joints work like they should. There are things you can do on your own to help relieve TMD symptoms. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), like naproxen or ibuprofen, can relieve muscle pain and swelling. Apply an ice pack to the side of your face and temple area for about 10 minutes. When you're done, hold a warm towel or washcloth to the side of your face for about 5 minutes. Add yogurt, mashed potatoes, cottage cheese, soup, scrambled eggs, fish, cooked fruits and vegetables, beans, and grains to your menu. Skip hard, crunchy foods (like pretzels and raw carrots), chewy foods (like caramels and taffy), and thick or large bites that require you to open wide. Keep yawning and chewing (especially gum or ice) to a minimum and don't yell, sing, or do anything that forces you to open wide. Practice good posture to reduce neck and facial pain. Put your tongue between your teeth to control clenching or grinding during the day. Learn relaxation techniques to help loosen up your jaw. Your dentist can prescribe higher doses of NSAIDs if you need them for pain and swelling. He might suggest a muscle relaxer to relax your jaw if you grind or clench your teeth. They lessen the effects of clenching or grinding and correct your bite by putting your teeth in a more correct position. Your dentist can replace missing teeth and use crowns, bridges, or braces to balance the biting surfaces of your teeth or to correct a bite problem. If the treatments listed above don't help, your dentist may suggest one or more of the following: Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). This therapy uses low-level electrical currents to provide pain relief by relaxing your jaw joint and facial muscles. Deep heat applied to the joint can relieve soreness or improve mobility. Pain medication or anesthesia is injected into tender facial muscles called \"trigger points\" to give relief. Radio waves stimulate the joint, which increases blood flow and eases pain. This lowers pain and inflammation and helps you move your neck more freely and open your mouth wider. The type you need depends on the problem. Arthrocentesis is used if you have no major history of TMJ but your jaws are locked. He'll give you general anesthesia, then insert needles into the joint and wash it out. He may use a special tool to get rid of damaged tissue or dislodge a disc stuck in the joint, or to unstick the joint itself. You'll get general anesthesia, then the doctor will make a small cut in front of your ear and insert the tool. It'll be hooked up to a video screen, so he can examine your joint and the area around it. He may remove inflamed tissue or realign the disc or joint. You may need this type of surgery if: The bony structures in your jaw joint are wearing down You have tumors in or around the joint Your joint is scarred or full of bone chips You'll get general anesthesia, then the doctor will open up the entire area around the joint so he can get a full view and better access. You'll need longer to heal after open-joint surgery, and there is a greater chance of scarring and nerve injury."], [987, "Temper Tantrums", "If you have a young child, you probably know what temper tantrums are. Experts define them as sudden, unplanned displays of anger or other emotions. During a tantrum, children often whine, cry, or scream. But remember, tantrums are most intense at the start, and they usually last only 2 minutes or less. And most children stop having tantrums by age 4 or 5, when they learn healthy ways to handle strong emotions. A tantrum is a normal response when something blocks a young child from gaining independence or learning a skill. The child may not yet have the skills to express strong emotions in other ways. For example, a temper tantrum may happen when a child gets frustrated because he can't button a shirt. Or a child may get upset when she is told it's time for bed but she wants to stay up. Your child is more likely to have temper tantrums if you react too strongly to poor behavior or give in to the child's demands. If you sense that a tantrum is coming, you may be able to stop it. Encourage your child to take a break from a frustrating activity. Remove your child from a situation that is likely to cause tantrums. Situations such as a large family dinner or the lights and noise of a carnival may be too much for a young child to handle. After a tantrum starts, ignoring it may work best. Never punish or make fun of a child who has a temper tantrum. Or set up a safe place in the home where your child can go to calm down. Children learn by watching their parents, so let your child see that you can handle your own strong emotions calmly. If your child has a lot of tantrums, time-out may be an option. This is usually around age 2 or 3 years. For a time-out, you send or put your child someplace safe, such as a chair in a hallway, for a few minutes. This gives the child time to calm down. It also teaches the child that having a temper tantrum is not acceptable behavior. You may be able to prevent some temper tantrums or at least reduce how often they happen. Keep a regular schedule that includes set meal times and enough hours of sleep. Having a routine can help your child to feel in control and stay positive. Put breakable or valuable items out of your child's reach. Praise your child for good behavior and for doing things that you would expect from a child that age. Children who still have tantrums after the age of 4 may need help learning to deal with their emotions. Tantrums that continue or start during the school years may be a sign of learning problems or other issues that the child may need help with. They may destroy things or hurt themselves or other people. This violent behavior may be a sign of a more serious problem. Talk with a doctor if: You are worried about your child's temper tantrums. Your child gets violent or destroys things during tantrums. You have problems handling your child's behavior, especially if you think that you might hurt your child. It may be helpful to keep a record of your child's behavior for a few days before your doctor visit. This will help the doctor assess your child's behavior and decide if testing is needed."], [988, "Telecanthus with Associated Abnormalitie...", "X-linked Opitz G/BBB syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by facial anomalies, respiratory and genitourinary abnormalities and other midline defects as well as developmental delay or mental retardation.

The same medicines are used to treat PMR and giant cell arteritis. Symptoms often start suddenly and get worse without treatment. The most common symptoms are muscle pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulders, or hips. Other symptoms may include: Tiredness and lack of energy. Your doctor will do a physical exam and ask you about your symptoms and past health. For example, the doctor may look for pain and stiffness in your shoulders, which may be a sign of PMR. The doctor will also consider your age in diagnosing this condition. These may include: Blood tests such as sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. This test can show if you have anemia, which is common in people who have PMR. Your doctor may also do tests to rule out those conditions, which include arthritis and hypothyroidism. PMR is treated with steroid medicines, which reduce inflammation. You'll probably feel better in a day or two after you start the medicine. But you may need to keep taking steroid medicine for 1 to 2 years or even longer. This helps to keep your symptoms from coming back. Long-term treatment with steroid medicine will put you at risk for bone thinning (osteoporosis). This is because steroid medicines reduce how well your body takes in calcium, which is important in building strong bones. Your doctor may recommend a bone density test to see if you need medicine to prevent osteoporosis. Or your doctor may start you on the medicine without the test. Your doctor may also suggest that you take medicine to help protect your digestive tract, such as a proton pump inhibitor or an H2 blocker. Taking medicines like steroids for a long time can irritate your esophagus and stomach and lead to ulcers. Proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers help reduce this irritation. It often occurs in the first 2 years of treatment or during the first year after steroid medicine is stopped. If you have a relapse, your doctor will increase your steroid dosage for a while. Then you can slowly lower it after your symptoms go away. To protect your bones while you are being treated with steroid medicines: Be sure you get enough calcium and vitamin D. Calcium can help prevent bone thinning. Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium. Ask your doctor if you need to take calcium and vitamin D supplements. Calcium supplements may interfere with your body's ability to absorb bisphosphonates. So take your calcium and vitamin D supplement at least 30 minutes after you take your bisphosphonate. This will help keep your bones strong and may also help your mood."], [990, "Teething", "Your baby is teething when his or her first set of teeth, called primary teeth , break through the gums.

Upper front teeth usually come in 1 to 2 months after the lower front teeth. See a picture that shows when the primary teeth come in . Some babies are fussier than usual when they are teething. This may be because of soreness and swelling in the gums before a tooth comes through. Many babies don't seem to be affected by teething. Babies may bite on their fingers or toys to help relieve the pressure in their gums. Many babies drool during teething, which can cause a rash on the chin, face, or chest. Mild symptoms that get better usually are nothing to worry about. Call your doctor if your baby's symptoms are severe or don't get better. Here are some tips to help your baby feel better while teething: Use a clean finger (or cold teething ring) to gently rub your baby's gum for about 2 minutes at a time. Many babies find this soothing, although they may protest at first. Provide safe objects for your baby to chew on, such as teething rings. If needed, give your baby an over-the-counter pain reliever that is labeled for his or her specific age.

For information about depression with episodes of high energy (mania), see the topic Bipolar Disorder in Children and Teens. Depression is a serious mood disorder that can take the joy from a child's life. You can expect these feelings after the death of a pet or a move to a new city. But if these feelings last for weeks or months, they may be a sign of depression. Experts used to think that only adults could get depression. Now we know that even a young child can have depression that needs treatment to improve. As many as 2 out of 100 young children and 8 out of 100 teens have serious depression.1 Still, many children don't get the treatment they need. This is partly because it can be hard to tell the difference between depression and normal moodiness. Also, depression may not look the same in a child as in an adult. If you are worried about your child, learn more about the symptoms in children. The sooner a child gets treatment, the sooner he or she will start to feel better. A child may be depressed if he or she: Is irritable, sad, withdrawn, or bored most of the time. Feel hopeless, worthless, or guilty. It can be hard to see that symptoms are all part of the same problem. Also, the symptoms may be different depending on how old the child is. Both very young children and grade-school children may lack energy and become withdrawn. They may show little emotion, seem to feel hopeless, and have trouble sleeping. Often they will lose interest in friends and activities they liked before. Some teens and children with severe depression may see or hear things that aren't there (hallucinate) or have false beliefs (delusions). A child who feels a little \"down\" most of the time for a year or more may have a milder, ongoing form of depression called dysthymia (say \"dis-THY-mee-uh\"). In its most severe form, depression can cause a child to lose hope and want to die. Whether depression is mild or severe, there are treatments that can help. But it is linked to a problem with activity levels in certain parts of the brain as well as an imbalance of brain chemicals that affect mood. Things that may cause these problems include: Stressful events, such as changing schools, going through a divorce, or losing a close family member or friend. To diagnose depression, a doctor may do a physical exam and ask questions about your child's past health. You and your child may be asked to fill out a form about your child's symptoms. The doctor may ask your child questions to learn more about how he or she thinks, acts, and feels. So the child may have tests to help rule out physical problems, such as a low thyroid level or anemia. It is common for children with depression to have other problems too, such as anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or an eating disorder. The doctor may ask questions about these problems to help your child get the right diagnosis and treatment. Usually one of the first steps in treating depression is education for the child and his or her family. Teaching both the child and the family about depression can be a big help. Counseling may help the child feel better. The type of counseling will depend on the age of the child. For young children, play therapy may be best. Older children and teens may benefit from cognitive-behavioral therapy. A child with severe depression may need to be treated in the hospital. Encourage your child to get regular exercise, spend time with supportive friends, eat healthy foods, and get enough sleep. See that your child takes any medicine as prescribed and goes to all follow-up appointments. Remind your child that things will get better in time. Antidepressant medicines often work well for children who are depressed. These medicines may increase the risk that a child will think about or try suicide, especially in the first few weeks of use. If your child takes an antidepressant, learn the warning signs of suicide, and get help right away if you see any of them. Giving away belongings.Withdrawing from family and friends.Having a plan, such as a gun or pills. Talking, drawing, or writing about death. But it can take as many as 6 to 8 weeks to see more improvement. Make sure your child takes antidepressants as prescribed and keeps taking them so they have time to work.

Teens may try a number of substances, including cigarettes, alcohol, household chemicals (inhalants), prescription and over-the-counter medicines, and illegal drugs. Marijuana is the illegal drug that teens use most often. Teens may use a substance for many reasons. Teens tend to try new things and take risks, so they may take drugs or drink alcohol because it seems exciting. Teens with family members who have problems with alcohol or other drugs are more likely to have serious substance abuse problems. Substance abuse can lead to serious problems such as poor schoolwork, loss of friends, problems at home, and lasting legal problems. Alcohol and drug abuse is a leading cause of teen death or injury related to car crashes, suicides, violence, and drowning. Substance abuse can increase the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV, because of unprotected sex. Even occasional alcohol use by a teen increases the risk for future alcohol and drug problems. Many illegal drugs today are made in home labs, so they can vary greatly in strength. These drugs also may contain bacteria, dangerous chemicals, and other unsafe substances. It's important to be aware of the signs that your teen may be abusing alcohol, drugs, or other substances. Some of the signs include: Red eyes and health complaints, such as being overly tired. If your teen often uses over-the-counter eyedrops, he or she may be trying to cover up red eyes caused by smoking marijuana. Less interest in school, a drop in grades, and skipping classes or school. Chemical-soaked rags or papers, which may mean that your teen is inhaling vapors. Other signs of this are paint or other stains on your teen's clothing, hands, or face. If your teen is using alcohol, tobacco, or drugs, take it seriously. In most cases, a hostile, angry face-to-face meeting pushes your teen away from the family. The type of treatment your teen needs depends on the level of substance abuse. For example, if your teen has tried drugs or alcohol only a few times, talking openly with him or her about the problem may be all that you need to do. But if your teen has a substance abuse problem, then he or she needs to be seen by a doctor, a counselor, or both. If your teen is addicted to a drug or alcohol, he or she may need to have detoxification treatment or a treatment that replaces the substance with medicine. To help prevent substance use: Talk to your child early about what you expect in his or her behavior toward alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. If your teen thinks that you will allow substance use, he or she is more likely to try drugs or alcohol.

In TBM, the disorder develops gradually."], [998, "TB (Tuberculosis)", "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infection caused by slow-growing bacteria that grow best in areas of the body that have lots of blood and oxygen. This is called pulmonary TB. But TB can also spread to other parts of the body, which is called extrapulmonary TB. Treatment is often a success, but it is a long process. It usually takes about 6 to 9 months to treat TB. But some TB infections need to be treated for up to 2 years. Tuberculosis is either latent or active. Latent TB means that you have the TB bacteria in your body, but your body's defenses (immune system) are keeping it from turning into active TB. This means that you don't have any symptoms of TB right now and can't spread the disease to others. If you have latent TB, it can become active TB. Active TB means that the TB bacteria are growing and causing symptoms. If your lungs are infected with active TB, it is easy to spread the disease to others. Pulmonary TB (in the lungs) is contagious. It spreads when a person who has active TB breathes out air that has the TB bacteria in it and then another person breathes in the bacteria from the air. If TB is only in other parts of the body (extrapulmonary TB), it does not spread easily to others. Some people are more likely than others to get TB. Have close contact with someone who has active TB, such as living in the same house as someone who is infected with TB. Care for a patient who has active TB, such as doctors or nurses. Live or work in crowded places, such as prisons, nursing homes, or homeless shelters, where other people may have active TB. Have poor access to health care, such as homeless people and migrant farm workers. Travel to or were born in places where untreated TB is common, such as Latin America, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. It is important for people who are at a high risk for getting TB to get tested once or twice every year. Most of the time when people are first infected with TB, the disease is so mild that they don't even know they have it. Symptoms of active TB may include: A cough that brings up thick, cloudy, and sometimes bloody mucus from the lungs (called sputum) for more than 2 weeks. Shortness of breath and chest pain (in rare cases). During the skin test, a doctor or nurse will inject TB antigens under your skin. If you have TB bacteria in your body, within 2 days you will get a red bump where the needle went into your skin. The test can't tell when you became infected with TB or if it can be spread to others. A blood test also can be done to look for TB. To find pulmonary TB, doctors test a sample of mucus from the lungs (sputum) to see if there are TB bacteria in it. Doctors sometimes do other tests on sputum and blood or take a chest X-ray to help find pulmonary TB. To find extrapulmonary TB, doctors can take a sample of tissue (biopsy) to test. Most of the time, doctors combine four antibiotics to treat active TB. It's important to take the medicine for active TB for at least 6 months. If tests still show an active TB infection after 6 months, then treatment continues for another 2 or 3 months. If the TB bacteria are resistant to several antibiotics (multidrug-resistant TB), then treatment may be needed for a year or longer. Making sure every dose is taken reduces their risk for getting active TB. If you miss doses of your medicine, or if you stop taking your medicine too soon, your treatment may fail or have to go on longer. This can also cause the infection to get worse or may lead to an infection that is resistant to antibiotics. A doctor or nurse may have to watch you take it to make sure that you never miss a dose and that you take it the proper way. If active TB is not treated, it can damage your lungs or other organs and can be deadly."], [999, "Tay-Sachs Disease", "Tay-Sachs is a rare disease that is passed down through some families. A person with Tay-Sachs has changed (mutated) genes that don't make any or enough of an enzyme called hexosaminidase A (hex A). Without it, fatty compounds build up in the nerve cells of the brain and cause damage. There are two forms of Tay-Sachs: The most common form develops soon after a baby is born. Late-onset Tay-Sachs can start between puberty and the mid-30s. Tay-Sachs can occur when parents pass on a changed gene to their child. If a baby gets the changed gene from both parents, he or she will get the disease. If the baby gets the changed gene from only one parent, he or she will be a carrier. This means that the child will have one gene that produces hex A and one that doesn't. In late-onset Tay-Sachs (LOTS), the body makes a small amount of hex A. People with LOTS inherit the late-onset hex A gene change from one or both parents. The changed gene that causes Tay-Sachs disease is more commonly found in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. About 1 out of 30 people in this population is a carrier of the disease.1 People of French-Canadian descent from the East Saint Lawrence River Valley of Quebec and people of Cajun descent in Louisiana are also more likely than others to carry the changed gene. But when the child is: 3 to 6 months of age, you may notice that the child makes less eye contact and has a hard time focusing his or her eyes on things. A doctor may see a red spot on the child's retina. 6 to 10 months of age, you may notice that the child is not as alert and playful as he or she had been. 10 months and older, the disease gets worse quickly. The child may have seizures, have an intellectual disability, lose his or her vision, and not be able to move. If you or your doctor thinks that your child has Tay-Sachs disease, your doctor will do a physical exam and a blood test to check the level of hex A. A genetic test may be needed to be sure the disease is Tay-Sachs. The focus of treatment for Tay-Sachs disease is to control symptoms and make your child as comfortable as possible. It may be helpful to seek counseling or find support from others who are going through the same thing you are. Talk to your doctor about: Your concerns and the help you'll need for your child. As the disease gets worse, your child will need more care. If you are thinking about having a child, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that:2 Both you and your partner get a screening test if you are both of Ashkenazi Jewish, French-Canadian, or Cajun descent or have a family history of the disease. You or your partner get a screening test if either of you is of Ashkenazi Jewish, French-Canadian, or Cajun descent or has a family history of the disease. Carriers of the Tay-Sachs gene changes can pass the changed gene to their children even though the carriers don't have the disease. If both you and your partner are carriers, there is a 1-out-of-4 chance (25%) that any child you have will have Tay-Sachs disease."], [1000, "Taybi Syndrome", "Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome is a rare genetic multisystem disorder that affects many organ systems of the body.

But when it comes to laying the groundwork to help your kids develop a healthy understanding of sex, having that conversation can feel overwhelming. When your child is in middle school (if not earlier), you're bound to start getting questions, which they're probably also discussing with their friends. And since they're going to be gathering information, it's best that it's accurate and that it comes from you. Talking with your child about sex is important to help him or her develop healthy attitudes toward sex and to learn responsible sexual behavior. What they learn elsewhere might not be true and might not reflect the personal and moral values and principles you want your children to follow. You need your preteen or teen to understand the possible consequences of being sexually active -- including pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and all of the emotional trappings that come with being part of a sexual relationship. Studies show that teens who have discussed sex with their parents are more likely to wait longer to begin having sex and more likely to use contraception when they do. Consider using the following list of topics as a guide: Explanation of anatomy and reproduction in males and females Sexual intercourse and pregnancy Fertility and birth control Other forms of sexual behavior, including oral sex, masturbation, and petting Sexual orientation, including heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality The physical and emotional aspects of sex, including the differences between males and females Self-image and peer pressure Sexually transmitted diseases Rape and date rape, including putting oneself in a high-risk situation such as being intoxicated (drunk or high), accepting rides or going to private places with strangers or acquaintances, and not traveling in groups or double dating with friends How choice of clothing and the way you present yourself, including body language, sends messages to others about your interest in sexual behavior Some parents are uncomfortable talking to their kids about sex. It may help to practice what you are going to say before you sit down with your son or daughter. Some kids may be embarrassed to talk about sex or to admit they don't know something. Opportunities may come from a scene on TV or in a movie, a book or an article, or the appearance of visible changes in your son or daughter, such as the growth of breasts or facial hair. When talking with your teen, consider the following teen sexual rights, which were developed by the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS).

Each of the following characteristics may be present, and each may vary from mild to severe: The foot (especially the heel) is usually smaller than normal. The foot may turn in, and in extreme cases, the bottom of the foot can point up. In some cases, clubfoot is just the result of the position of the baby while it is developing in the mother's womb (postural clubfoot). But more often clubfoot is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors that is not well understood. If your family has one child with clubfoot, the chances of a second infant having the condition increase. Clubfoot can also be the result of problems that affect the nerve, muscle, and bone systems, such as stroke or brain injury. The foot will remain twisted out of shape, and the affected leg may be shorter and smaller than the other. It is more common for your doctor to diagnose the condition after the infant is born, though, based on the appearance and mobility of the feet and legs. In some cases, especially if the clubfoot is due just to the position of the growing baby (postural clubfoot), the foot is flexible and can be moved into a normal or nearly normal position after the baby is born. Some of the baby's foot and ankle bones are not fully ossified (filled in with bony material) and do not show well on X-ray. When treatment for clubfoot starts soon after birth, the foot grows to be stable and positioned to bear weight for standing and moving comfortably. The foot (or feet) is moved (manipulated) into the most normal position possible and held (immobilized) in that position until the next treatment. In Canada and the United States this is usually done with a cast, but in some countries strapping with adhesive tape or splinting is more common. This manipulation and immobilization procedure is repeated every 1 to 2 weeks for 2 to 4 months, moving the foot a little closer toward a normal position each time. Some children have enough improvement that the only further treatment is to keep the foot in the corrected position by splinting it as it grows. The two common methods of manipulation and casting are the \"traditional\" and the Ponseti (Iowa) methods. In traditional treatment, one position of the foot at a time is treated with manipulation and casting. Usually, the inward direction of the front of the foot is corrected first. In the Ponseti method, two problems with foot position (the front part of the foot being turned in and up) are corrected at the same time. Toward the end of the series of castings, if the whole foot is pointing down, children treated with this method still need a minor surgery to lengthen the tight Achilles tendon. The Ponseti method works well if it is started right away and if the doctor's instructions for bracing are followed after casting is finished. It helps at least 90 out of 100 children who have clubfoot.1 If a few months of progressive manipulation and immobilization don't move the foot into a more normal position, your child's doctor may suggest surgery. Splinting or casting is usually used after surgery to keep the foot in the correct position during healing. After either nonsurgical or surgical treatment, your child usually wears splints for a period of time to keep the clubfoot from starting to form again. If your child had surgery, he or she may also need physical therapy. Also, the affected foot will continue to be somewhat smaller (often 11/2 shoe sizes or less) and stiffer than the unaffected foot, and the calf of the leg will be smaller.

A closely related condition called vasculitis is inflammation of blood vessels in general -- including veins and arteries. Takayasu's arteritis is an uncommon condition in which inflammation damages large and medium-sized arteries. The arteries most commonly affected are the branches of the aorta (the main blood vessel that leaves the heart), including the blood vessels that supply blood to the arms and travel through the neck to provide blood to the brain. Less commonly, arteries that provide blood to the heart, intestines, kidneys, and legs may be involved. Inflammation of large blood vessels may cause segments of the vessels to weaken and stretch, resulting in an aneurysm (bulging blood vessel). Approximately half of all people with Takayasu's arteritis will have a sense of generalized illness. The changes that occur in Takayasu's arteritis are often gradual, allowing alternate (collateral) routes of blood flow to develop. In general, however, the blood flow that occurs beyond an area of narrowing is almost always adequate to allow tissues to survive. Narrowing of blood vessels to the arms or legs may cause fatigue, pain, or aching due to reduced blood supply -- especially during activities such as shampooing the hair, exercising, or walking. Similarly, a doctor may notice that the strength of pulses in the wrists, neck, or groin may not be equal, or the pulse on one side may be absent. Takayasu's arteritis most often affects young Asian women, but it also can affect children and adults of all ages and ethnic backgrounds. At diagnosis, Takayasu's arteritis patients often are between the ages of 15 and 35. Every year in the U.S., two to three people are diagnosed with Takayasu's arteritis for every one million Americans. The diagnosis of Takayasu's arteritis is based on a combination of factors, including: A complete medical history and careful physical exam to exclude other illnesses that may have similar symptoms Imaging studies (such as MRI, X-rays, and angiograms), which show location and severity of vessel damage Presence of a bruit. Significant narrowing of blood vessels may result in turbulent blood flow through the narrowed area that creates an unusual sound called a \"bruit.\" Note: With most other forms of vasculitis, a biopsy (tissue sample) of the affected area confirms the presence of blood vessel inflammation. However, when large blood vessels are affected, a biopsy is often not practical because of the risks associated with surgery. Once it is apparent that the disease is under control, doctors slowly reduce the dosage of prednisone (a steroid) to sustain improvement, thereby trying to minimize treatment side effects. As the dosage of prednisone is gradually reduced, about half of all patients will have recurrent symptoms or progression of illness. When these drugs are added to prednisone to treat Takayasu's arteritis, 50% of patients who had previously relapsed will achieve remission and be able to gradually discontinue prednisone. This emphasizes the need for continuing research to identify better and less toxic treatments for Takayasu's arteritis and other forms of vasculitis. In some cases, it is desirable to stretch narrow vessel openings with a balloon (a technique known as \"angioplasty\") or to do a bypass operation to restore normal flow to the kidney. Some patients may have serious disabilities because of narrowed blood vessels that supply other sites, such as the arms or legs. In the U.S. and Japan, Takayasu's arteritis is fatal in only about 3% of patients who have had the disease for an average of five years. Reports from other parts of the world have been less optimistic, possibly because it is not as readily recognized and treated. Approximately 25% of patients with Takayasu's arteritis seen at The Cleveland Clinic have an entirely normal lifestyle. Takayasu's arteritis is clearly a treatable disease and most patients improve. However, it is apparent that many patients have to deal with consequences of this illness that may be partially or, less often, completely disabling.

For most people who have SVT, the heart still works normally to pump blood through the body. Types of SVT include: Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). During an episode of SVT, the heart's electrical system doesn't work right, causing the heart to beat very fast. After treatment or on its own, the heart usually returns to a normal rate of 60 to 100 beats a minute. SVT may start and end quickly, and you may not have symptoms. SVT is also called atrial tachycardia, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), or paroxysmal atrial tachycardia (PAT). Most episodes of SVT are caused by faulty electrical connections in the heart . Others may have: Palpitations, a feeling that the heart is racing or pounding. Your doctor will diagnose SVT by asking you questions about your health and symptoms, doing a physical exam, and perhaps giving you tests. Your doctor: Will ask if anything triggers the fast heart rate, how long it lasts, if it starts and stops suddenly, and if the beats are regular or irregular. May do a test called an electrocardiogram (EKG, ECG). This test measures the heart's electrical activity and can record SVT episodes. If you do not have an episode of SVT while you're at the doctor's office, your doctor probably will ask you to wear a portable electrocardiogram (EKG), also called an ambulatory electrocardiogram. Your doctor also may do tests to find the cause of the SVT. Some SVTs don't cause symptoms, and you may not need treatment. To treat sudden episodes of SVT, your doctor may: Prescribe a medicine to take when the SVT occurs. You may be able to do this by coughing, gagging, or putting your face in ice-cold water. If these treatments don't work, you may have to go to your doctor's office or the emergency room. If the SVT is serious, you may have electrical cardioversion, which uses an electrical current to reset the heart rhythm. If you often have episodes of SVT, you may need to: Take medicine every day to prevent the episodes or slow your heart rate. You can try some things at home to help prevent SVT by avoiding the things that trigger it. To find your triggers, keep a diary of your heart rate and your symptoms. You might find, for example, that smoking or alcohol causes your SVT episodes. So most people do not have to avoid chocolate or caffeinated coffee, tea, or soft drinks."], [1027, "Uterine Fibroids", "A lot of women have uterine fibroids at some point in their life. Uterine fibroids, which your doctor may call leiomyomas or myomas, are muscular tumors that can grow on your uterus. They rarely turn into cancer, and if you get them it doesn't mean you're more likely to get uterine cancer. Fibroids can vary a lot in size, shape, and location. They can show up in your uterus, uterine wall, or on its surface. They can also attach to your uterus by a stalk- or stem-like structure. Others grow in big masses that can affect the size and shape of the uterus. Uterine fibroids usually appear in women of childbearing age -- generally between 30 and 40 years old, but they can show up at any age. Some women may find out they have uterine fibroids because their doctor discovers them during a routine exam or ultrasound. If you do have symptoms, they might include: Heavy bleeding or painful periods Bleeding between periods Pressure, pain, or fullness in your lower stomach Enlarged abdomen or uterus Constipation Needing to pee often or trouble emptying your bladder Pain during sex Miscarriages or infertility Experts don't know exactly why you get fibroids. Estrogen and progesterone are the hormones that make the lining of your uterus thicken every month during your period. Besides age and race, there are a few other things that can raise your chances of developing uterine fibroids, such as family history. You're more likely to get fibroids if your mom or sister has had them. Many other things can contribute to your chances of getting uterine fibroids, including: Getting your first period at a young age Birth control use Vitamin D deficiency Eating too much red meat and not enough green vegetables, fruit, or dairy Alcohol No, but there is some research that suggests certain lifestyle habits can reduce your chances. Another study found that eating fresh fruits and cruciferous vegetables like arugula, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, collard greens, and turnip greens could lower your odds. Cruciferous vegetables are rich in beta-carotene, folate, vitamins C, E, and K, and other minerals. Regular exercise also can lower your chances of uterine fibroids."], [1028, "Uterine Fibroid Surgery, Deciding About", "To treat uterine fibroids, surgery can be used to remove fibroids only (myomectomy) or to remove the entire uterus (hysterectomy). Surgery is a reasonable treatment option when: Heavy uterine bleeding and/or anemia has continued after several months of therapy with birth control hormones and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). You have urinary or bowel problems (from a fibroid pressing on your bladder, ureter, or bowel). Fibroids are a possible cause of your trouble getting pregnant. Surgical treatment options include: Myomectomy, or fibroid removal. This may improve your chances of having a baby if the fibroid is inside the uterus and prevents a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus. Hysterectomy is the only fibroid treatment that prevents regrowth of fibroids. Myomectomy or hysterectomy can be done through one or more small incisions using laparoscopy, through the vagina, or through a larger abdominal cut (incision). If you are hoping for a future pregnancy, myomectomy is your one surgical option. Heavy, prolonged, and painful periods caused by uterine fibroids will stop naturally after you reach menopause. If you are nearing menopause and your symptoms are tolerable, consider controlling symptoms with home treatment and medicine until menopause. Uterine fibroid embolization (UFE) may also be a reasonable option for you, although it has some risks."], [1029, "Uterine Fibroid Embolization, Deciding A...", "Fibroids can be surgically removed, the blood supply to fibroids can be cut off, the entire uterus can be removed, or medicine can temporarily shrink fibroids or manage symptoms. Your choice will depend on whether you have severe symptoms and whether you want to preserve your fertility. If you have uterine fibroids but you have few or no symptoms, you don't need treatment. This means that you will have pelvic exams to check on fibroid growth and symptoms. If you are nearing menopause, watchful waiting may be an option for you, depending on how tolerable your symptoms are. After menopause, your estrogen and progesterone levels will drop, which causes most fibroids to shrink and symptoms to subside. If you have pain or heavy menstrual bleeding, it may be from a bleeding uterine fibroid. But it may also be linked to a simple menstrual cycle problem or other problems. The following medicines are used to relieve heavy menstrual bleeding, anemia, or painful periods, but they do not shrink fibroids: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy improves menstrual cramping and reduces bleeding for many women. Based on different studies, progestin may shrink fibroids or may make them grow.2 This might be different for each woman. Iron supplements, available without a prescription, are an important part of correcting anemia caused by fibroid blood loss. If you have fibroids, there is no way of knowing for certain whether they are affecting your fertility. If a fibroid distorts the wall of the uterus, it can prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus. This may make an in vitro fertilization less likely to be successful, if the fertilized egg doesn't implant after it is transferred to the uterus.3 Surgical fibroid removal, called myomectomy, may improve your chances of having a baby.3 Because fibroids can grow again, it is best to try to become pregnant as soon as possible after a myomectomy. If you have fibroid-related pain, heavy bleeding, or a large fibroid that is pressing on other organs, you can consider shrinking the fibroid, removing the fibroid (myomectomy), or removing the entire uterus (hysterectomy). After all treatments except hysterectomy, fibroids may grow back. To shrink a fibroid for a short time, hormone therapy with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRH-a) puts the body in a state like menopause. GnRH-a therapy can help to: Shrink a fibroid before it is surgically removed. This lowers your risk of heavy blood loss and scar tissue from the surgery. GnRH-a therapy is used for only a few months, because it can weaken the bones. To shrink or destroy fibroids without surgery, uterine fibroid embolization (UFE) (also called uterine artery embolization) stops the blood supply to the fibroid. UFE preserves the uterus, but pregnancy is not common after treatment. This treatment uses high-intensity ultrasound waves to break down the fibroids. But more studies are needed to find out if it works over time.2 This treatment may not be available everywhere. To surgically remove fibroids, myomectomy can often be done through one or more small incisions using laparoscopy or through the vagina (hysteroscopy). Sometimes, a larger abdominal incision is needed depending on where the fibroid is located in the uterus. Myomectomy preserves the uterus, and it makes pregnancy possible for some women. To surgically remove the entire uterus, hysterectomy is available to women with long-lasting or severe symptoms who have no future pregnancy plans."], [1030, "Uterine cancer, sarcoma: Treatment - Pat...", "Uterine sarcoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the muscles of the uterus or other tissues that support the uterus. The cervix is at the lower, narrow end of the uterus, and leads to the vagina. The organs in the female reproductive system include the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina. Uterine sarcoma is a very rare kind of cancer that forms in the uterine muscles or in tissues that support the uterus. Uterine sarcoma is different from cancer of the endometrium, a disease in which cancer cells start growing inside the lining of the uterus. Being exposed to x-rays can increase the risk of uterine sarcoma. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Risk factors for uterine sarcoma include the following: Past treatment with radiation therapy to the pelvis. Signs of uterine sarcoma include abnormal bleeding. Abnormal bleeding from the vagina and other signs and symptoms may be caused by uterine sarcoma or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following: Bleeding that is not part of menstrual periods. Tests that examine the uterus are used to detect (find) and diagnose uterine sarcoma. The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Pelvic exam: An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum. The doctor or nurse inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and the other hand is placed over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. A speculum is also inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. A Pap test or Pap smear of the cervix is usually done. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.Pelvic exam. A doctor or nurse inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and presses on the lower abdomen with the other hand. This is done to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The vagina, cervix, fallopian tubes, and rectum are also checked. Pap test: A procedure to collect cells from the surface of the cervix and vagina. A piece of cotton, a brush, or a small wooden stick is used to gently scrape cells from the cervix and vagina. Because uterine sarcoma begins inside the uterus, this cancer may not show up on the Pap test. Transvaginal ultrasound exam: A procedure used to examine the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and bladder. An ultrasound transducer (probe) is inserted into the vagina and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. An ultrasound probe connected to a computer is inserted into the vagina and is gently moved to show different organs. The probe bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture). Dilatation and curettage: A procedure to remove samples of tissue from the inner lining of the uterus. The tissue samples are checked under a microscope for signs of disease. Endometrial biopsy : The removal of tissue from the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus) by inserting a thin, flexible tube through the cervix and into the uterus. The tube is used to gently scrape a small amount of tissue from the endometrium and then remove the tissue samples.

It does not cover cancer in the muscle of the uterus, which is called uterine sarcoma. This topic focuses on type I endometrial cancer, which is the most common kind of uterine cancer. Endometrial cancer is the growth of abnormal cells in the lining of the uterus . The lining is called the endometrium. Endometrial cancer is also called cancer of the uterus, or uterine cancer. Endometrial cancer usually occurs in women older than 50. The good news is that it is usually cured when it is found early. And most of the time, the cancer is found in its earliest stage, before it has spread outside the uterus. The most common cause of type I endometrial cancer is having too much of the hormone estrogen compared to the hormone progesterone in the body. This hormone imbalance causes the lining of the uterus to get thicker and thicker. If the lining builds up and stays that way, then cancer cells can start to grow. Women who have this hormone imbalance over time may be more likely to get endometrial cancer after age 50. The most common symptoms include: Bleeding or vaginal discharge not related to your period (menstruation). Endometrial cancer is usually diagnosed with a biopsy. In this test, the doctor removes a small sample of the lining of the uterus to look for cancer cells. The main treatment for endometrial cancer is surgery to remove the uterus plus the cervix, ovaries, and fallopian tubes. Other treatments include radiation therapy, hormone therapy, or chemotherapy.

Abnormal uterine bleeding has several causes. If you don't know what kind of bleeding you have, see the topic Abnormal Vaginal Bleeding. Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is irregular bleeding from the uterus that is longer or heavier than usual or does not occur at your regular time. For example, you may have heavy bleeding during your period or in between periods. If you are pregnant and have any amount of bleeding from the vagina, be sure to tell your doctor. Abnormal uterine bleeding has many causes. In some cases the cause of the bleeding isn't known. You may have abnormal uterine bleeding if you have one or more of the following symptoms: You get your period more often than every 21 days or farther apart than 35 days. A normal adult menstrual cycle is 21 to 35 days long. A normal teen cycle is 21 to 45 days. Your period lasts longer than 7 days (normally 4 to 6 days). If you are passing blood clots and soaking through your usual pads or tampons each hour for 2 or more hours, your bleeding is considered severe and you should call your doctor. Before your doctor finds the cause of abnormal uterine bleeding, he or she must first make sure it's not vaginal bleeding from pregnancy or miscarriage. Your doctor will ask how often, how long, and how much you have been bleeding. You may also have a pelvic exam, urine test, blood tests, and possibly an ultrasound. These tests will help your doctor check for other causes of your symptoms. He or she may also take a tiny sample (biopsy) of tissue from your uterus for testing. Let your doctor know if you have abnormal uterine bleeding. Others are used to reduce bleeding or to stop monthly periods.

All interstitial lung diseases affect the interstitium, a part of the lungs' anatomic structure. All forms of interstitial lung disease cause thickening of the interstitium. Some forms of interstitial lung disease are short-lived; others are chronic and irreversible. Some of the types of interstitial lung disease include: Interstitial pneumonia: Bacteria, viruses, or fungi may infect the interstitium of the lung. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis : A chronic, progressive form of fibrosis (scarring) of the interstitium. Nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis: Interstitial lung disease that's often present with autoimmune conditions (such as rheumatoid arthritis or scleroderma). Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: Interstitial lung disease caused by ongoing inhalation of dust, mold, or other irritants. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP): A pneumonia-like interstitial lung disease but without an infection present. Acute interstitial pneumonitis: A sudden, severe interstitial lung disease, often requiring life support. Desquamative interstitial pneumonitis: An interstitial lung disease that's partially caused by smoking. Sarcoidosis: A condition causing interstitial lung disease along with swollen lymph nodes, and sometimes heart, skin, nerve, or eye involvement. Bacteria, viruses, and fungi are known to cause interstitial pneumonias. Regular exposures to inhaled irritants at work or during hobbies can also cause some interstitial lung disease. These irritants include: Asbestos Silica dust Talc Coal dust, or various other metal dusts from working in mining Grain dust from farming Bird proteins (such as from exotic birds, chickens, or pigeons) Drugs such as nitrofurantoin, amiodarone, bleomycin, and many others can rarely cause interstitial lung disease. Interstitial lung disease is more common in people with autoimmune disease, including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma. Other symptoms of interstitial lung disease include: Cough, which is usually dry and nonproductive. In most forms of interstitial lung disease, the shortness of breath develops slowly (over months). In interstitial pneumonias or acute interstitial pneumonitis, symptoms come on more rapidly (in hours or days). Chest X-ray films in people with interstitial lung disease may show fine lines in the lungs. Computed tomography (CT scan): A CT scanner takes multiple X-rays of the chest and a computer creates detailed images of the lungs and surrounding structures. Interstitial lung disease can usually be seen on a CT scan. High-resolution CT scan: If interstitial lung disease is suspected, using certain CT scanner settings can improve the images of the interstitium. Lung biopsy: Often, obtaining lung tissue to examine under a microscope is the only way to determine which type of interstitial lung disease a person has. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS): Using tools inserted through small incisions, a surgeon can sample multiple areas of lung tissue. Open lung biopsy (thoracotomy): In some cases, traditional surgery with a large incision in the chest is needed to obtain a lung biopsy. Treatments for interstitial lung disease vary according to the type of interstitial lung disease and its cause. Azithromycin (Zithromax) and levofloxacin (Levaquin) eliminate the bacteria that cause most interstitial pneumonias. Fungal pneumonias are rare, but can be treated with antifungal drugs. Corticosteroids: In some forms of interstitial lung disease, ongoing inflammation in the lungs causes damage and scarring. Inhaled oxygen: In people with low oxygen blood levels due to interstitial lung disease, inhaled oxygen may improve symptoms. Lung transplant : In advanced interstitial lung disease causing severe impairment, a lung transplant may be the best option. Most people undergoing lung transplant for interstitial lung disease make large gains in quality of life and their ability to exercise. Azathioprine (Imuran): This drug also suppresses the immune system. N-acetylcysteine (Mucomyst): This potent antioxidant may slow the decline of lung function in some forms of interstitial lung disease. Other treatments not used as often for interstitial lung disease include: Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) Methotrexate Cyclosporine Pirfenidone (Exbriet) Nintedanib (OFEV) These medicines suppress the immune system significantly."], [1034, "Using Nitroglycerin for Sudden Chest Pai...", "Nitroglycerin is a vasodilator, a medicine that opens blood vessels to improve blood flow. It is used to treat angina symptoms, such as chest pain or pressure, that happens when there is not enough blood flowing to the heart. To improve blood flow to the heart, nitroglycerin opens up (dilates) the arteries in the heart (coronary arteries), which improves symptoms and reduces how hard the heart has to work. Nitroglycerin comes in quick-acting forms and long-acting forms. Quick-acting forms of nitroglycerin are used to relieve angina or used just before activities that typically cause angina. The tablets are placed under the tongue (sublingual) or between the cheek and gum (buccal). Long-acting forms of nitroglycerin are used to prevent angina from happening. These long-acting forms include pills, tablets, skin ointment, and skin patches. Your doctor will advise you when to use your nitroglycerin. In general, quick-acting nitroglycerin is used: To relieve sudden angina. Sit or lie down to take your nitroglycerin. Taking nitroglycerin can lower your blood pressure, which could cause you to pass out if you are standing up. For sudden episodes of angina, use nitroglycerin in a tablet or liquid spray form. The medicine won't work if it is swallowed.Place the between-cheek-and-gum (buccal) tablet between your cheek and gum. If you accidentally swallow the tablet, take another.

Place the between-cheek-and-gum (buccal) tablet between your cheek and gum. If you accidentally swallow the tablet, take another. The medicine won't work if it is swallowed. After you call , continue to stay on the phone with the emergency operator. Normal, temporary side effects of nitroglycerin include a warm or flushed feeling, headache, dizziness, or lightheadedness. Do not take the erection-enhancing medicine sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), or vardenafil (Levitra) if you are taking nitroglycerin. Combining nitroglycerin with any of these medicines can cause a life-threatening drop in blood pressure. If you have angina and have taken one of these erection-enhancing medicines, be sure to tell your doctor so that you are not given nitroglycerin or another nitrate medicine. Do not take the pulmonary hypertension medicine sildenafil (Revatio) if you are taking nitroglycerin or another nitrate medicine. Store nitroglycerin pills in a dark-colored (such as brown), airtight, glass container that you cannot see through. Keep nitroglycerin pills and liquid spray away from heat or moisture.

Bacteria can cause infections such as strep throat, ear infections, urinary tract infections, and sinus infections (sinusitis). Each works a little differently and acts on different types of bacteria. Antibiotics are powerful medicines, but they cannot cure everything. Antibiotics do not work against illnesses that are caused by a virus. If you take antibiotics when you do not need them, they may not work when you do need them. Each time you take antibiotics, you are more likely to have some bacteria that the medicine does not kill. These bacteria can change (mutate) so they are harder to kill. Then, the antibiotics that used to kill them no longer work. These bacteria are called antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These tougher bacteria can cause longer and more serious infections. To treat them you may need different, stronger antibiotics that have more side effects than the first medicine and may cost more. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria also can spread to family members, children, and fellow workers. Your community then will have a risk of getting an infection that is harder to cure and costs more to treat. Some antibiotics that doctors prescribed in the past to treat common infections no longer work. Taking antibiotics you do not need will not help you feel better, cure your illness, or keep others from catching your infection. In rare cases, this reaction can require emergency care. Antibiotics also can cause Clostridium difficilecolitis (also called C. difficilecolitis), a swelling and irritation of the large intestine, or colon . This happens because the antibiotics kill the normal bacteria in your intestine and allow the C. difficile bacteria to grow. This problem can cause diarrhea, fever, and belly cramps. Know that antibiotics can help treat infections caused by bacteria but not by viruses. Here are some things you can do to help make sure antibiotics will work when you need them: Always ask your doctor if antibiotics are the best treatment. Avoid pressuring your doctor into prescribing antibiotics when they won't help you feel better or cure your illness. Do not use antibiotics that were prescribed for a different illness or for someone else. Keep your hands clean by washing them well with soap and clean, running water. Get a flu vaccine and other vaccines when you need them. If you need to take antibiotics, always tell your doctor or pharmacist about other medicines or dietary supplements you are taking. Be sure to talk about any special diet you may be following, any food or drug allergies you may have, and any health problems you have. And make sure your doctor knows if you are pregnant or trying to get pregnant. If the label says to take the medicine at a certain time, follow these directions. But it is important to keep taking the antibiotic as directed. You need the full prescription to get rid of those bacteria that are a bit stronger and survive the first few days of treatment. Bacteria that an antibiotic cannot kill (antibiotic-resistant bacteria) can develop if you (and many other people) take only part of an antibiotic prescription. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and stomach pain. In women, antibiotics can lead to vaginal yeast infections. In rare cases, antibiotics can cause a dangerous allergic reaction that requires emergency care.

Problems or damage either in the urinary tract or in the nerves that control urination. Stress incontinence can be caused by childbirth, weight gain, or other conditions that stretch the pelvic floor muscles . When these muscles can't support your bladder properly, the bladder drops down and pushes against the vagina. So urine may leak because of the extra pressure on the bladder when you cough, sneeze, laugh, exercise, or do other activities. Urge incontinence is caused by an overactive bladder muscle that pushes urine out of the bladder. It may be caused by irritation of the bladder, emotional stress, or brain conditions such as Parkinson's disease or stroke. If you have stress incontinence, you may leak a small to medium amount of urine when you cough, sneeze, laugh, exercise, or do similar things.

If your doctor thinks it may be caused by more than one problem, you will likely have more tests. They depend on the type of incontinence you have and how much it affects your life. After your doctor knows what has caused the incontinence, your treatment may include exercises, bladder training, medicines, a pessary, or a combination of these. In many cases, these lifestyle changes can be enough to control incontinence. If you need help quitting, talk to your doctor about stop-smoking programs and medicines. Go to the bathroom at several set times each day, and wear clothes that you can remove easily. Make your path to the bathroom as clear and quick as you can. Keep track of your symptoms and any leaking of urine with a bladder diary. This can help you and your doctor find the best treatment for you. If you have symptoms of urinary incontinence, don't be embarrassed to tell your doctor. Strengthening your pelvic muscles with Kegel exercises may lower your risk for incontinence. Quitting may make you cough less, which may help with incontinence."], [1067, "Urinary Incontinence in Men", "Urinary incontinence is the accidental leaking of urine. Urine is made by the kidneys and stored in a sac made of muscle, called the urinary bladder. Around this tube is a ring of muscles called the urinary sphincter. As the bladder fills with urine, nerve signals tell the sphincter to stay squeezed shut while the bladder stays relaxed. The nerves and muscles work together to prevent urine from leaking out of the body. When you have to urinate, the nerve signals tell the muscles in the walls of the bladder to squeeze. This forces urine out of the bladder and into the urethra. At the same time the bladder squeezes, the urethra relaxes. This allows urine to pass through the urethra and out of the body. Incontinence can happen for many reasons: If your bladder squeezes at the wrong time, or if it squeezes too hard, urine may leak out. If the muscles around the urethra are damaged or weak, urine can leak out even if you don't have a problem with your bladder squeezing at the wrong time. If your bladder doesn't empty when it should, you are left with too much urine in the bladder. If the bladder gets too full, urine will leak out when you don't want it to. If something is blocking your urethra, urine can build up in the bladder. Urinary incontinence can be short-term or long-lasting (chronic). Short-term incontinence is often caused by other health problems or treatments. This topic is about the different types of chronic urinary incontinence: Stress incontinence means that you leak urine when you sneeze, cough, laugh, lift something, change position, or do something that puts stress or strain on your bladder. Urge incontinence is an urge to urinate that's so strong that you can't make it to the toilet in time. It also happens when your bladder squeezes when it shouldn't. This can happen even when you have only a small amount of urine in your bladder. Overactive bladder is a kind of urge incontinence. But not everyone with an overactive bladder leaks urine. Overflow incontinence means that you have the urge to urinate, but you can release only a small amount. Since your bladder doesn't empty as it should, it then leaks urine later. Total incontinence means that you are always leaking urine. Functional incontinence means that you can't make it to the bathroom in time to urinate. This is usually because something got in your way or you were not able to walk there on your own. Different types of incontinence have different causes. Stress incontinence can happen when the prostate gland is removed. If there has been damage to the nerves or to the sphincter, the lower part of the bladder may not have enough support. Keeping urine in the bladder is then up to the sphincter alone. Urge incontinence is caused by bladder muscles that squeeze so hard that the sphincter can't hold back the urine. Overflow incontinence can be caused by something blocking the urethra, which leads to urine building up in the bladder. In men, incontinence is often related to prostate problems or treatments. Your doctor will do a physical exam, ask questions about your symptoms and past health, and test your urine. Often this is enough to help the doctor find the cause of the incontinence. You may need other tests if the leaking is caused by more than one problem or if the cause is unclear. Treatments depend on the type of incontinence you have and how much it affects your life. Your treatment may include medicines, simple exercises, or both. If you need help quitting, talk to your doctor about stop-smoking programs and medicines. Make your path to the bathroom as clear and quick as you can. When you urinate, practice double voiding. This means going as much as you can, relaxing for a moment, and then going again. Use a diary to keep track of your symptoms and any leaking of urine. This can help you and your doctor find the best treatment for you.

To diagnose bladder pain syndrome (BPS), your doctor may do a test called cystoscopy that uses a thin, lighted tube to see the inside of your bladder. He or she may also do a urine test to rule out other problems, such as a urinary tract infection. Some doctors think BPS may be caused by abnormal changes in the lining of the bladder. Because of this, treatment focuses on helping to relieve symptoms. Your doctor may have you use a bladder diary(What is a PDF document?) The pain from BPS can be mild to severe but almost always goes away right after you urinate. Other symptoms of BPS include: Urinating often during the day and night. Feeling pressure, discomfort, and a persistent urge to urinate. People with BPS may go days or weeks with no symptoms. To help your bladder get used to comfortably holding more urine, you can slowly increase the time between when you urinate during the day (not while sleeping).If you find you are urinating every 30 minutes, for example, you can set a schedule of going every 45 minutes during the day.If that works for a week, you may be able to increase your time to every 60 minutes.Slowly work your way up to 21/2 hours.

There are hundreds of different genetic metabolic disorders, and their symptoms, treatments, and prognoses vary widely. A few major examples of metabolism include: Breaking down the carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in food to release energy. In most inherited metabolic disorders, a single enzyme is either not produced by the body at all or is produced in a form that doesn't work. Their enzyme levels are usually adequate, so they may have no symptoms of a genetic metabolic disorder. However, the child who inherits two defective gene copies cannot produce enough effective enzyme and develops the genetic metabolic disorder. The original cause of most genetic metabolic disorders is a gene mutation that occurred many, many generations ago. Considered all together, inherited metabolic disorders may affect about 1 in 1,000 to 2,500 newborns. In certain ethnic populations, such as Ashkenazi Jews (Jews of central and eastern European ancestry), the rate of inherited metabolic disorders is higher. Hundreds of inherited metabolic disorders have been identified, and new ones continue to be discovered. Some of the more common and important genetic metabolic disorders include: Lysosomal storage disorders : Lysosomes are spaces inside cells that break down waste products of metabolism. Various enzyme deficiencies inside lysosomes can result in buildup of toxic substances, causing metabolic disorders including: Hurler syndrome (abnormal bone structure and developmental delay) Niemann-Pick disease (babies develop liver enlargement, difficulty feeding, and nerve damage) Tay-Sachs disease (progressive weakness in a months-old child, progressing to severe nerve damage; the child usually lives only until age 4 or 5) Gaucher disease (bone pain, enlarged liver, and low platelet counts, often mild, in children or adults) Fabry disease (pain in the extremities in childhood, with kidney and heart disease and strokes in adulthood; only males are affected) Krabbe disease (progressive nerve damage, developmental delay in young children; occasionally adults are affected) Galactosemia: Impaired breakdown of the sugar galactose leads to jaundice, vomiting, and liver enlargement after breast or formula feeding by a newborn. Maple syrup urine disease: Deficiency of an enzyme called BCKD causes buildup of amino acids in the body. Phenylketonuria (PKU): Deficiency of the enzyme PAH results in high levels of phenylalanine in the blood. Glycogen storage diseases: Problems with sugar storage lead to low blood sugar levels, muscle pain, and weakness. Mitochondrial disorders: Problems inside mitochondria, the powerhouses of cells, lead to muscle damage. Friedreich ataxia: Problems related to a protein called frataxin cause nerve damage and often heart problems. Peroxisomal disorders: Similar to lysosomes, peroxisomes are tiny spaces filled with enzymes inside cells. Poor enzyme function inside peroxisomes can lead to buildup of toxic products of metabolism. Peroxisomal disorders include: Zellweger syndrome (abnormal facial features, enlarged liver, and nerve damage in infants) Adrenoleukodystrophy (symptoms of nerve damage can develop in childhood or early adulthood depending on the form.) Metal metabolism disorders: Levels of trace metals in the blood are controlled by special proteins. Inherited metabolic disorders can result in protein malfunction and toxic accumulation of metal in the body: Wilson disease (toxic copper levels accumulate in the liver, brain, and other organs) Hemochromatosis (the intestines absorb excessive iron, which builds up in the liver, pancreas, joints, and heart, causing damage) Organic acidemias: methylmalonic acidemia and propionic acidemia. Urea cycle disorders: ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and citrullinemia The symptoms of genetic metabolic disorders vary widely depending on the metabolism problem present. Some symptoms of inherited metabolic disorders include: Lethargy Poor appetite Abdominal pain Vomiting Weight loss Jaundice Failure to gain weight or grow Developmental delay Seizures Coma Abnormal odor of urine, breath, sweat, or saliva The symptoms may come on suddenly or progress slowly. Inherited metabolic disorders are present at birth, and some are detected by routine screening. Once symptoms develop, specific blood or DNA tests are available to diagnose most genetic metabolic disorders. Referral to a specialized center (usually at a university) increases the chances of a correct diagnosis. Treatments for genetic metabolic disorders follow a few general principles: Reduce or eliminate intake of any food or drug that can't be metabolized properly. Replace the enzyme or other chemical that is missing or inactive, to restore metabolism to as close to normal as possible. Remove toxic products of metabolism that accumulate due to the metabolic disorder. Treatment may include such measures as: Special diets that eliminate certain nutrients Taking enzyme replacements, or other supplements that support metabolism Treating the blood with chemicals to detoxify dangerous metabolic by-products Whenever possible, a person with an inherited metabolic disorder should receive care at a medical center with experience with these rare conditions.

In most cases, the kneecap shifts too far toward the outside of the leg. Your knee joint is a complex hinge that joins the two bones of the lower leg with the thighbone. A problem with any of these parts in or around the knee can lead to patellar tracking disorder. Patellar tracking disorder is usually caused by several problems combined, such as: Weak thigh muscles. Tendons, ligaments, or muscles in the leg that are too tight or too loose. Activities that stress the knee again and again, especially those with twisting motions. A traumatic injury to the knee, such as a blow that pushes the kneecap toward the outer side of the leg. You are more likely to have patellar tracking disorder if you have any of the above problems and you are overweight, run, or play sports that require repeated jumping, knee bending, or squatting. If you have a patellar tracking problem, you may have: Pain in the front of the knee, especially when you squat, jump, kneel, or use stairs (most often when going down stairs). A feeling of popping, grinding, slipping, or catching in your kneecap when you bend or straighten your leg. A feeling that your knee is buckling or giving way, as though all of a sudden your knee can't support your weight. If your kneecap is completely dislocated, you may have severe pain and swelling. Your knee may look like a bone is out of place. And you may not be able to bend or straighten the knee. It can be hard to tell the difference between patellar tracking disorder and some other knee problems. To find out what problem you have, your doctor will: Ask questions about your past health, your activities, when the pain started, and whether it was caused by an injury, overuse, or something else. You may have an X-ray so your doctor can check the position and condition of your knee bones. Patellar tracking disorder can be a frustrating problem, but be patient. As a rule, the longer you have had this problem, the longer it will take to get better. Treatment of patellar tracking disorder has two goals: to reduce your pain and to strengthen the muscles around your kneecap to help it stay in place. If you don't have severe pain or other signs of a dislocated kneecap, you can try home treatment for a week or two to see if it will reduce your pain. Take a break from activities that cause knee pain, like squatting, kneeling, running, and jumping. As your knee pain starts to decrease, do exercises to increase strength and flexibility in your leg and hip. Your doctor or physical therapist may also suggest that you: Tape your knee to hold the kneecap in place. Use a knee brace for extra knee support. Try shoe inserts (orthotics) to improve the position of your feet. There are several types of surgery that can correct a tracking problem. You can take steps to prevent patellar tracking disorder.

Without blood and the oxygen it carries, part of the heart starts to die. Quick treatment can restore blood flow to the heart and save your life. Your doctor might call a heart attack a myocardial infarction, or MI. Your doctor might also use the term acute coronary syndrome for your heart attack or unstable angina. Angina (say \"ANN-juh-nuh\" or \"ann-JY-nuh\") is a symptom of coronary artery disease. Angina occurs when there is not enough blood flow to the heart. Symptoms of angina include chest pain or pressure, or a strange feeling in the chest. Some people feel pain, pressure, or a strange feeling in the back, neck, jaw, or upper belly, or in one or both shoulders or arms. There are two types of angina: Stable angina has a typical pattern. Unstable angina is unexpected, and resting or taking nitroglycerin may not help. It may mean that you are having a heart attack. Heart attacks happen when blood flow to the heart is blocked. This usually occurs because fatty deposits called plaque have built up inside the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart. If a plaque breaks open, the body tries to fix it by forming a clot around it. The clot can block the artery , preventing the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart. This process of plaque buildup in the coronary arteries is called coronary artery disease, or CAD. Plaque deposits may limit blood flow to the heart and cause angina. But too often, a heart attack is the first sign of CAD. Things like intense exercise, sudden strong emotion, or illegal drug use (such as a stimulant, like cocaine) can trigger a heart attack. Symptoms of a heart attack include: Chest pain or pressure, or a strange feeling in the chest. Pain, pressure, or a strange feeling in the back, neck, jaw, or upper belly, or in one or both shoulders or arms. But women are somewhat more likely than men to have other symptoms like shortness of breath, nausea, and back or jaw pain. Here are some other ways to describe the pain from heart attack: Many people describe the pain as discomfort, pressure, squeezing, or heaviness in the chest. The pain may spread down the left shoulder and arm and to other areas , such as the back, jaw, neck, or right arm. Unstable angina has symptoms similar to a heart attack. Describe your symptoms, and say that you could be having a heart attack. Aspirin helps keep blood from clotting, so it may help you survive a heart attack. Describe your symptoms, and say that you could be having a heart attack. Aspirin helps keep blood from clotting, so it may help you survive a heart attack. If you cannot reach emergency services, have someone drive you to the hospital right away. If you go to the hospital in an ambulance, treatment will be started right away to restore blood flow and limit damage to the heart. Medicines to decrease the heart's workload and ease pain. It can detect signs of poor blood flow, heart muscle damage, abnormal heartbeats, and other heart problems. Blood tests, including tests to see whether cardiac enzymes are high. Having these enzymes in the blood is usually a sign that the heart has been damaged. Cardiac catheterization, if the other tests show that you may be having a heart attack. This test shows which arteries are blocked and how your heart is working. If cardiac catheterization shows that an artery is blocked, a doctor may do angioplasty right away to help blood flow through the artery. Or a doctor may do emergency bypass surgery to redirect blood around the blocked artery. After these treatments, you will take medicines to help prevent another heart attack. If you stop taking your medicine, you might raise your risk of having another heart attack. After you have had a heart attack, the chance that you will have another one is higher. Taking part in a cardiac rehab program helps lower this risk. It can help you learn how to eat a balanced diet and exercise safely. It is common to feel worried and afraid after a heart attack. Getting treatment for depression may help you recover from a heart attack. Heart attacks are usually the result of heart disease, so taking steps to delay or reverse coronary artery disease can help prevent a heart attack. Heart disease is a leading cause of death for both men and women, so these steps are important for everyone. Quitting smoking can quickly reduce the risk of another heart attack or death.

Normally, before he is born, his testicles move down into his scrotum, the sac that hangs below the penis. When one testicle does not move into the scrotum as it should, the baby has an undescended testicle . In rare cases, both testicles are undescended. Most of the time, the testicle descends (drops) on its own by the time the baby is 3 months old. If your baby's testicle hasn't dropped by the time he is 6 months of age, your doctor may suggest treatment. The scrotum may look a little smoother or less developed on one side, or the side without a testicle may look smaller and flatter. You can't feel the testicle in the scrotum on the side where it hasn't descended. At newborn and well-baby visits, your doctor will check your baby's scrotum. If the testicle can be felt but it is not in the scrotum, the doctor will probably want to check your baby again at 3 to 6 months of age. By this time, the testicle may have moved into place on its own. It could still be in the baby's belly, it could be too small to feel, or it could be absent. The doctor may recommend a type of surgery called laparoscopy to see if he or she can find the testicle. Laparoscopy requires only a small cut below the belly button, which heals quickly. If both testicles are undescended and can't be felt in the groin, the doctor will do a blood hormone test to find out if the testicles are absent. Some other conditions are closely related to undescended testicles, such as an ectopic or retractile testicle. In both of these conditions, the testicle is in an abnormal position in the groin or scrotum. If the testicle hasn't dropped on its own within 6 months, your doctor may recommend surgery (orchiopexy or orchidopexy). When babies have a testicle that can't be felt, doctors may do a different surgery that needs only a small cut (laparoscopy). It may cause the testicle to drop down into the scrotum. But it doesn't always work, and it may cause side effects. Treatment is important, because having an undescended testicle increases the risk of: Infertility.

If hypothyroidism is not treated, it can raise your cholesterol levels. But hypothyroidism can be treated with medicine that can help you feel like yourself again. People of any age can get hypothyroidism, but older adults are more likely to get it. Women age 60 and older have the highest risk. You are more likely to get the disease if it runs in your family. In the United States, the most common cause is Hashimoto's thyroiditis. It causes the body's immune system to attack thyroid tissue. As a result, the gland can't make enough thyroid hormone. Other things that can lead to low levels of thyroid hormone include surgery to remove the thyroid gland and radiation therapy for cancer. Less common causes include viral infections and some drugs, such as amiodarone and lithium. Dry skin and brittle nails. If your doctor thinks you have hypothyroidism, a simple blood test can show if your thyroid hormone level is too low. Doctors usually prescribe pills to treat hypothyroidism. But you will likely need to keep taking the pills from now on. It's important to take your medicine just the way your doctor tells you to. You will also need to see your doctor for follow-up visits to make sure you have the right dose. Getting too much or too little thyroid hormone can cause problems.

After the first few years of life (though it may take somewhat longer), the foreskin will gradually retract more easily. By the time a boy is 5 years old, his foreskin is usually fully retractable. Pushing your son's foreskin back too early can damage it and cause scar tissue to form. When a boy reaches puberty, he needs to clean under his foreskin every day. If your son's foreskin does not fully retract by the time he reaches puberty, call your doctor for advice."], [1087, "Umbilical Hernia in Children", "An umbilical hernia happens when intestine, fat, or fluid pushes through a weak spot or hole in your baby's stomach muscles. This causes a bulge near or in the belly button, or navel. It may look like your child's belly button is swollen. The ring of muscle and other tissue that forms where blood vessels in the umbilical cord enter a fetus's body is known as the umbilical ring. If it doesn't close, tissue may bulge through the opening, creating a hernia. An umbilical hernia can usually be seen after the umbilical cord stump falls off, within a few weeks after birth. When a child has an umbilical hernia: You may notice a soft bulge under the skin of the belly button. The bulge may be easier to see when your child sits or stands upright or strains stomach muscles during normal activities such as crying, coughing, or having a bowel movement. Talk to your doctor if your child is vomiting, has pain, or has a swollen belly. If your child has a hernia, your doctor will check its size and shape and see whether the hernia can be pushed back in. The doctor will want to check your child regularly to see if the hernia has begun to close. If a hernia has not closed by the time your child is 5 years old, your child probably will need surgery to close it. You may want your child to have surgery before he or she is age 5 if: The hernia is large and has not shown any signs of closing by age 2. If your child has pain, a swollen belly, or other signs that a part of the intestine is trapped in the hernia (incarcerated hernia), surgery will be needed right away. Surgery to repair the hernia usually is an outpatient procedure, which means that your child can go home the same day the surgery is done. Sometimes more surgery may be done to improve how the belly button looks (for instance, if the hernia was very large or there was a lot of extra skin). Be sure to go to all follow-up exams so the doctor can make sure your child is healing well."], [1088, "Umbilical Cord Care", "After the umbilical cord is cut at birth, a stump of tissue remains attached to your baby's belly button (navel). The stump gradually dries and shrivels until it falls off, usually 1 to 2 weeks after birth. It is important that you keep the umbilical cord stump and surrounding skin clean and dry. It may also help the umbilical cord stump to fall off and the navel to heal more quickly. Gently clean your baby's umbilical cord stump and the surrounding skin at least once a day and as needed during diaper changes or baths. The stump usually falls off in 1 or 2 weeks, but sometimes it takes longer. You can help your baby's umbilical cord stump fall off and heal faster by keeping it dry between cleanings. Keep your baby's diaper folded below the umbilical cord stump. If folding does not work well, try cutting out an area in the front of the diaper (before you put it on your baby) to keep the stump exposed to air. It also helps prevent diaper contents, such as urine, from irritating the stump. Keep the umbilical cord stump above the water level until the stump falls off and heals. This helps you position your baby for a sponge bath and helps you keep the umbilical cord out of the water. Usually no problems will develop as long as you keep the area clean and dry. The umbilical cord stump usually falls off in 1 or 2 weeks. You may notice a red, raw-looking spot right after the stump falls off. A small amount of fluid sometimes tinged with blood may ooze out of the navel area. It is normal for this to last up to 2 weeks after the stump falls off. If it doesn't heal or dry completely within 2 weeks, call your doctor. Call your baby's doctor if you see any signs of an infection. Red, tender skin around the base of the cord.

If you make a donation to a public cord blood bank, you can't reserve it for your family, so it may not be available for your future use. Both the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American Medical Association (AMA) recommend public cord blood banking over private cord blood banking. Public cord blood banking makes stem cells available to anyone who needs them. Public cord blood donation will increase the number and diversity of cord blood units available for patients. Widespread donations by minorities will expand the available pool of minority cord blood units in the public system and make it easier for the following groups to find matches: American Indians and Alaska Natives Asians African-Americans Hispanics Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders People who are multiracial American Indians and Alaska Natives Asians African-Americans Hispanics Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders People who are multiracial If you choose to donate cord blood for public use, you should be aware that the blood will be tested for both genetic abnormalities and infectious diseases. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) neither recommends nor advises against cord blood banking. But along with the AAP and AMA, it cautions parents about private cord blood banking. The chance of privately banked cord blood being used by your child is extremely low. Stem cell transplant using an individual's own cord blood (called an autologous transplant) cannot be used for genetic disorders such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia, because the genetic mutations which cause these disorders are present in the baby's cord blood. Other diseases that are treated with stem cell transplant, such as leukemia, may also already be present in a baby's cord blood. Because of these limitations and the uncommon occurrence of the diseases treatable with stem cell transplant, there have been just more than 400 autologous cord blood transplants in United States in the last two decades. In short, the AAP and the AMA recommend against storing cord blood as a form of \"biological insurance,\" because the benefits are too remote to justify the costs. These conditions include : Leukemia Immune deficiencies, such as severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) Lymphoma (Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's) Aplastic anemia Sickle cell anemia Krabbe's disease Thalassemia Other rare diseases Even so, a brother or a sister has only a 25% chance of being a perfect genetic match. Keep in mind, however, that to find a suitable match for any type of transplant, 70% must look outside their family. No one knows how stem cells will be used in the future, but researchers hope that they may be used to treat many conditions, like Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart failure, spinal cord damage, and other conditions. It's possible that storing your child's cord blood cells now may be useful one day in combating these diseases. It's also not clear if stem cells from cord blood -- as opposed to stem cells from other sources -- will be useful in these potential treatments."], [1090, "ULS (Upper Limb Spascity)", "Upper limb spasticity is a condition that affects the way you move your arms. Sometimes, your arms will twitch or move in a way you can't control, called a spasm. Some tasks, like getting dressed or bathing, become hard. There are many treatments that can make your muscles more flexible and give you better control of your arm movements. If your symptoms improve, you may be able to reduce your treatment. Your muscles move when they get electrical signals from the nerves that branch throughout your body. When your brain or spinal cord is damaged, they don't send those signals the right way. The uneven signaling causes your muscles to flex, stiffen, and twitch. There are several things that can damage your brain or nervous system and lead to upper limb spasticity. Without the blood and oxygen they need, brain cells can die, creating problems with some of the nerves in your body. The condition can cause: Stiff arm muscles Twitches or movements that you can't control Trouble using or moving your arms Tightness in the muscles in your elbows, wrists, or fingers Arms that get stuck in uncomfortable positions, such as pressed against your side. Rotated shoulders Bent elbows or wrists Hands clenched into fists Difficulty or pain when you move or straighten your arm, elbows, wrists, or fingers Without treatment, your muscles can seem frozen in these positions. If you notice muscle tightness, spasms, or stiff limbs at any time after you've had a stroke or brain injury, you should tell your doctor right away. She'll give you a physical exam and test your muscle movement to see how well you can control your arms, elbows, wrists, and hands. She may ask you to move your arms on your own to see how much control you have. The doctor will also ask you questions about your symptoms, like: Which muscles are having spasms? Your doctor may also use a test called electromyography, or EMG, to see how well your arm muscles and nerves are working. For this test, you'll sit or lie down, and a technician will put electrodes on your arms. The electrodes have small needles that go into your muscles, and they're attached by wires to a machine that can measure the electricity in your muscles and nerves. Your doctor will ask you to slowly flex and relax your arms so the machine can record the activity. She may also inject a drug to briefly numb the area where you have spasms to see if they still happen when you can't move your muscles. You'll want to find out as much as you can about your condition so you can learn how to control it and feel better. The goal of treatments for upper limb spasticity is to keep your muscles from becoming too stiff and give you more freedom to move your arms. It's important to get therapy so you can keep moving your muscles and stop them from getting stiffer and more painful. Your doctor will recommend a treatment based on how healthy you are and the symptoms you have. Exercises, like stretches, may help your joints and muscles become more flexible. Braces or splints hold your muscles and joints in the right position and keep them from getting too tight. OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) and abobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport), used for the treatment of upper and lower limb spasticity, can relax muscles and ease spasms. Botox and Dysport have some potentially serious side effects such as breathing and swallowing issues, so make sure to discuss them with your physician. Drugs like clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Valium), and tizanidine (Zanaflex) also make your muscles more relaxed. Baclofen is a drug that corrects the way your nerves send signals to your muscles. Nerve block injections, shots of drugs that numb the nerves that cause muscles to twitch, may stop spasms when other medicines don't work. Surgery to cut connections between nerves or tendons and muscles that spasm. If your condition gets better, you may be able to reduce your treatment. Along with treatment, there are things you can do to keep your muscles and joints as flexible as possible. Play games or sports, or try to do normal household tasks to stay active and move stiff limbs. Stress can make spasticity worse, so find low-key activities that you enjoy. Without treatment, upper limb spasticity can make your muscles stiffer and more painful over time. But new treatments can give you better control of your arms and help you live an active life.

You may have no symptoms, or you may feel discomfort or burning pain. You can have two types of peptic ulcer disease: Gastric ulcer. This appears at the top end of the small intestine, an organ that digests and absorbs much of the food you eat. Ulcers form when digestive juices damage the walls of the stomach or small intestine. If the mucus layer gets too thin or your stomach makes too much acid, your gut will feel it. Most people infected with H. pylori do not get ulcers. But in others, it can raise the amount of acid, break down the protective mucus layer, and irritate the digestive tract. They think it may pass from person to person through close contact, like kissing. NSAIDs block your body from making a chemical that helps protect the inner walls of your stomach and small intestine from stomach acid. Other types of pain meds, such as acetaminophen, won't lead to peptic ulcers. But stress and eating a lot of spicy food don't cause ulcers, as experts once thought. You'll most likely feel a burning pain or discomfort between your belly button and breastbone. The pain may stop for a little while if you eat or take an antacid, but then return. The pain can last for a few minutes or a few hours, and may come and go for many days or weeks. Other symptoms may include: Bloated feeling Burping Lack of appetite or weight loss Nausea Bloody or dark poop Vomiting Small ulcers may not cause any symptoms. Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, whether you take NSAIDs and other drugs, and medical history. She may use a series of X-rays or a test called an endoscopy. She may also take a small piece of the lining to test for H. pylori. They can erode the blood vessel wall in your stomach or small intestine. The ulcers also can eat a hole through the lining and get infected. Or they can cause swelling, which may block food from moving from your stomach into your small intestine. If H. pylori is the culprit, your doctor may prescribe a mix of antibiotics to kill it. If aspirin and other NSAIDs are behind the ulcer, you may need to cut down on them, stop taking them altogether, or switch to another pain reliever. Your doctor may also give you antacids to fight stomach acid, or prescribe medicine to lessen the acid your body makes. Prescription drugs called cytoprotective agents can help protect the lining of the stomach or small intestine so the ulcer can heal."], [1094, "Vulvar cancer: Treatment - Patient Infor...", "Vulvar cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the vulva.

Less often, cancer affects the inner vaginal lips, clitoris, or vaginal glands. Abnormal cells can grow on the surface of the vulvar skin for a long time. Because it is possible for VIN to become vulvar cancer, it is very important to get treatment. Having vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia or HPV infection can affect the risk of vulvar cancer. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Risk factors for vulvar cancer include the following: Having vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN). Other possible risk factors include the following: Having many sexual partners. Having a history of abnormal Pap tests (Pap smears). Signs of vulvar cancer include bleeding or itching.

This deficiency is caused by heterozygous mutations in the PPOX gene, and leads to the accumulation of certain chemicals called porphyrins and porphyrin precursors in the body, which, in turn, can potentially result in a variety of symptoms. The genetic mutation in a family is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, but many individuals who inherit a PPOX mutation do not develop any symptoms (asymptomatic). Variegate porphyria is one of a group of disorders known as the porphyrias. The porphyrias are characterized by abnormally high levels of porphyrins or porphyrin precursors in the body. There are eight enzymes in the pathway for making heme, which is a part of hemoglobin and other hemoproteins. The symptoms associated with the various types of porphyria differ, depending upon the specific enzyme that is deficient. Porphyrins and porphyrin precursors originate in excess amounts from the liver in the hepatic types, and mostly from the bone marrow in the erythropoietic types. Protoporphyrinogen and coproporphyrinogen accumulate in the liver in variegate porphyria because PPOX is deficient, and become oxidized to protoporphyrin and coproporphyrin, which are transported in the blood plasma and cause the skin to be sensitive to sunlight. The neurological symptoms are associated with accumulation of porphyrin precursors, namely delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG)."], [1098, "Von Willebrand's Disease", "Von Willebrand's disease is a bleeding disorder. When you have this disease, it takes longer for your blood to form clots, so you bleed for a longer time than other people. Normally, when a person begins to bleed, small blood cells called platelets go to the site of the bleeding and clump together to help stop the bleeding. If you have von Willebrand's disease, your blood doesn't clot well because you don't have a certain protein in your blood or you have low levels of it. This protein is called the von Willebrand factor. It helps your blood to clot by helping the platelets stick together. In type 1, you are missing some von Willebrand factor. About 3 out of 4 people who have von Willebrand's disease have type 1.1 You may not know you have the disease, and you may not need treatment. In type 2, you have the von Willebrand factor, but it doesn't work as it should. In type 3, you don't have the von Willebrand factor or you have a very small amount. Von Willebrand's disease usually is passed down through families (inherited). If you have the disease, your doctor may suggest that your family members get tested for it too. It's possible to get acquired von Willebrand's disease later in life. This rare form of the disease isn't inherited. Bleeding a lot is the main symptom of von Willebrand's disease. Symptoms of mild von Willebrand's disease include: Frequent nosebleeds. Symptoms of more severe von Willebrand's disease include those listed above and: Blood in the urine. Von Willebrand's disease can be hard to diagnose. Some people who have mild von Willebrand's disease bleed about the same amount as other people do. If your doctor thinks you may have a problem with clotting, he or she may suggest: Blood tests that measure von Willebrand factor activity levels or von Willebrand factor antigen. Genetic testing that shows if you have a defect in your von Willebrand factor and what type of von Willebrand's disease you have. Treatment depends on the type of von Willebrand's disease you have, how much you bleed, and your risk for heavy bleeding. If you have a mild type of von Willebrand's disease, you may need to: Avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin, for example), and naproxen (Aleve). Take medicine to prevent heavy bleeding if you have an injury, are going to have surgery, or are about to give birth. If you have severe von Willebrand's disease, your treatment may include: Desmopressin medicine (DDAVP, Stimate) which helps your body release more of the von Willebrand clotting factor into your blood. Antifibrinolytic medicines, to help stop blood clots from breaking down. Birth control pills, or an intrauterine device (IUD) that contains hormones, to help control heavy menstrual periods.

Computed tomography (CT) scan or MRI. This test looks for blood, signs of bacterial infection, parasites, or white blood cells. Blood and urine tests to check for anemia, inflammation, or malnutrition.

You have persistent diarrhea for more than 2 weeks. Watchful waiting is not appropriate when you have any of the above symptoms. If your symptoms are caused by ulcerative colitis, delaying the diagnosis and treatment may make the disease worse. Even when the disease is in remission, your doctor will want to see you regularly to check for complications. It is always a good idea to call your doctor's office for advice.

Also, children with the disease may grow more slowly than normal and go through puberty later than expected. Problems from ulcerative colitis can include: Narrowed areas of the intestine (strictures). This risk is higher than average if you have had ulcerative colitis for 8 years or longer. The colon swelling to many times its normal size. Your doctor may recommend regular screening by a dermatologist.4 Some people who have ulcerative colitis also have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

Ulcerative colitis is a disease that causes inflammation and sores (ulcers) in the lining of the large intestine (colon ). In general, the more of the colon that's affected, the worse the symptoms will be. But most people who have it are diagnosed before the age of 30. You are more likely to get ulcerative colitis if other people in your family have it. The main symptoms are: Belly pain or cramps. Some people also may have a fever, may not feel hungry, and may lose weight. In severe cases, people may have diarrhea 10 to 20 times a day. In most people, the symptoms come and go. About 5 to 10 out of 100 people with ulcerative colitis have symptoms all the time.1 Doctors ask about the symptoms, do a physical exam, and do a number of tests. Testing can help the doctor rule out other problems that can cause similar symptoms, such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and diverticulitis. In this test, a doctor uses a thin, lighted tool to look at the inside of your entire colon. At the same time, the doctor may take a sample (biopsy) of the lining of the colon. Blood tests, which look for infection or inflammation. Stool sample testing to look for blood, infection, and white blood cells. Ulcerative colitis affects everyone differently. Your doctor will help you find treatments that reduce your symptoms and help you avoid new flare-ups. If your symptoms are mild, you may only need to use over-the-counter medicines for diarrhea (such as Imodium). Talk to your doctor before you take these medicines. Many people need prescription medicines, such as aminosalicylates, steroid medicines, or other medicines that reduce the body's immune response. But be sure to eat a healthy, varied diet to keep your weight up and to stay strong. If you have severe symptoms and medicines don't help, you may need surgery to remove your colon. Removing the colon cures ulcerative colitis. People who have ulcerative colitis for 8 years or longer also have a greater chance of getting colon cancer. The longer you have had ulcerative colitis, the greater your risk.2 Talk to your doctor about your need for cancer screening. These tests help find cancer early, when it is easier to treat.3 Ulcerative colitis can be hard to live with. During a flare-up, it may seem like you are always running to the bathroom.

As you exhale, air gently passes through your throat, across your open vocal cords, and out your mouth and nose. When you speak, your vocal cords close partially as air travels through them, causing vibrations and the unique sound of your voice. Anyone can develop a voice problem, but your risk is greatest if your job puts a high demand on your vocal cords. If you scream or talk loudly, you increase your risk for voice problems. If you have ever had surgery on or near your vocal cords, are a smoker, or have had throat cancer, your risk for developing scar tissue and future voice problems increases as well. Typically, symptoms that mean you may have a voice problem include: A low, raspy, or rough voice. Other tests may be done to evaluate vocal cord vibration or to detect suspicious areas in your throat. Additional testing doesn't necessarily mean you have a serious voice problem-it just helps your doctor pinpoint the cause of your voice problem. For many voice problems, resting your vocal cords is all that is needed, although this can be difficult for some people. If you have a more serious or chronic voice problem, you may need medicines, surgery, voice therapy, or a combination of these. But it may take some time for your voice to return to normal, depending on the severity and cause of your voice problem. If your voice problem is accompanied by a cold and goes away within 2 to 3 weeks after your cold or flu is gone, it's probably nothing serious. But when unexplained changes in your voice continue for more than 2 or 3 weeks or interfere with your ability to communicate, you may have a more serious problem.

Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause damage to your nerves and can affect memory and thinking. Most people get more than enough B12 from eating meat, eggs, milk, and cheese. Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia usually happens when the digestive system is not able to absorb the vitamin. This includes some types of surgery used to help very overweight people lose weight. This anemia can also happen if you don't eat enough foods with B12, but this is rare. People who eat a vegan diet and older adults who don't eat a variety of foods may need to take a daily vitamin pill to get enough B12. The amount of vitamin B12 you need depends on your age. Vitamin B12 is found in foods from animals, such as meat, seafood, milk products, poultry, and eggs. Some foods, like cereals, are fortified with vitamin B12. Check the label to find out how much B12 is in a supplement. As the anemia gets worse, you may: Feel weak, tired, and lightheaded. If the level of vitamin B12 stays low for a long time, it can damage your nerve cells. You will also have blood tests to check the number of red blood cells and to see if your body has enough vitamin B12. Some people whose vitamin B12 levels are too low also have low levels of folic acid. Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia is treated with supplements of vitamin B12. Taking supplements brings your level of vitamin B12 back to normal, so you do not have symptoms. To keep your level of vitamin B12 normal, you will probably need to take supplements for the rest of your life. Your vitamin B12 supplements might be pills or shots. They also cost less and are easier to take. If you have been getting shots, ask your doctor if you can switch to pills. Another form of treatment is a vitamin B12 nasal spray (such as Nascobal). You can take steps at home to improve your health by eating a varied diet that includes meat, milk, cheese, and eggs, which are good sources of vitamin B12. Also, eat plenty of foods that contain folic acid, another type of B vitamin.

Virtual colonoscopy is one of many tests that may be used to screen for colon cancer. For more information on screening tests for colon cancer, see: A virtual colonoscopy may be done to: Screen for colorectal cancer or polyps. Virtual colonoscopy is not commonly done for other conditions at this time but may prove to be useful to: Detect other problems or diseases of the anus, rectum, or large intestine (colon). Virtual colonoscopy requires the same cleansing colon prep as a regular colonoscopy. If you are having virtual colonoscopy using CT, you will be given some liquid to drink after your bowel prep. This drink is a contrast medium that makes the large intestine easier to see in the pictures. Virtual colonoscopy is usually done in the radiology department at a hospital or medical center. The test is most often done by a doctor who specializes in performing and interpreting diagnostic imaging tests (radiologist). First, you will be asked to lie on your back on the table of the CT or MRI machine. (There may be some discomfort as the gas expands your colon.) For MRI, a contrast liquid will be given through the tube into the colon. The table will slide into the CT or MRI machine so pictures of your colon can be taken. Virtual colonoscopy has advantages and disadvantages compared to a regular colonoscopy. Virtual colonoscopy is less invasive, safer, and takes less time than a regular colonoscopy. A thin tube to insert air into the colon is placed in the rectum rather than a long flexible tube that is moved up your colon. Virtual colonoscopy can show the inside of a colon that is narrow due to inflammation or an abnormal growth. Virtual colonoscopy may not show polyps smaller than 10 mm (0.4 in.). If a polyp is found, regular colonoscopy will be needed to confirm the diagnosis and remove the polyp so it can be looked at under a microscope. This is a newer test and isn't as widely available as regular colonoscopy. Virtual colonoscopy requires the same cleansing colon prep as a regular colonoscopy. If an abnormality is found on virtual colonoscopy, you may need a regular colonoscopy to remove and test the abnormal tissue. Virtual colonoscopy is not available everywhere because it requires special equipment and special training to interpret the test. The initial evaluations on virtual colonoscopy were done by highly trained radiologists, so the results of your virtual colonoscopy may vary widely depending on the amount of experience your doctor's office or clinic has with the procedure. Virtual colonoscopy is being studied to determine whether the results are as accurate (sensitivity) as a regular colonoscopy.

A sample of fluid is removed from around the spine and tested to see if it contains organisms that cause the illness. Your doctor may also order other tests, such as blood tests, a CT scan, or an MRI. Bacterial meningitis is treated with antibiotics in a hospital. You may also get dexamethasone, a type of steroid medicine. And you will be watched carefully to prevent serious problems such as hearing loss, seizures, and brain damage. But viral meningitis is more common, and most people with this form of the illness get better in about 2 weeks. With mild cases, you may only need home treatment. Home treatment includes taking medicine for fever and pain and drinking enough fluids to stay hydrated. The best way to protect your child from meningitis is to make sure he or she gets all the standard immunizations for children. Talk to your doctor about whether you or your child also needs the meningococcal vaccine, which is a shot to prevent bacterial meningitis. And at least one dose is recommended for anyone 6 weeks of age and older who has immune system problems or a damaged or missing spleen.

Children can get dehydrated quickly, so if your child has the stomach flu, it's important that you look for signs that he is very thirsty or has dry skin or a dry mouth. Keep children with gastroenteritis out of day care or school until all symptoms are gone. Drugs used to control diarrhea and vomiting aren't usually given to children younger than 5. To help prevent rotavirus -- the most common cause of stomach flu for children -- there are two vaccines that can be given to infants. There are many ways gastroenteritis can be spread: Contact with someone who has the virus Contaminated food or water Unwashed hands after going to the bathroom or changing a diaper The most common cause of gastroenteritis is a virus. Norovirus is the most common cause of serious gastroenteritis and also foodborne disease outbreaks in the U.S. Although not as common, bacteria such as E. coli and salmonella can also trigger the stomach flu. Salmonella and campylobacter bacteria are the most common bacterial causes of gastroenteritis in the U.S. and are usually spread by undercooked poultry, eggs, or poultry juices. It typically is spread from person to person, and common sources of infection are contaminated food and drinking water. You can pick up organisms such as giardia and cryptosporidium in contaminated swimming pools or by drinking contaminated water.

If lightheadedness gets worse, it can lead to a feeling of almost fainting or a fainting spell (syncope). Vertigo is a feeling that you or your surroundings are moving when there is no actual movement. You may feel as though you are off balance, spinning, whirling, falling, or tilting. When you have severe vertigo, you may feel very nauseated or vomit. You may have trouble walking or standing, and you may lose your balance and fall. Although dizziness can occur in people of any age, it is more common among older adults. A fear of dizziness can cause older adults to limit their physical and social activities. Lightheadedness often is caused by a momentary drop in blood pressure and blood flow to your head that occurs when you get up too quickly from a seated or lying position (orthostatic hypotension). Lightheadedness has many causes, including: Allergies. Vomiting, diarrhea, fevers, and other illnesses that cause dehydration. Most of the time, the location of the bleeding and the need to seek medical care are obvious. You may have small amounts of bleeding in your digestive tract over days or weeks without noticing the bleeding. Heavy menstrual bleeding also can cause this type of lightheadedness. Sometimes the cause of lightheadedness is an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), which can cause fainting spells (syncope). Many prescription and nonprescription medicines can cause lightheadedness or vertigo. The degree of lightheadedness or vertigo that a medicine causes will vary. Vision gives you information about your position and motion in relationship to the rest of the world. Sensory nerves in your joints allow your brain to keep track of the position of your legs, arms, and torso. Skin pressure sensation gives you information about your body's position and motion in relationship to gravity. A portion of the inner ear , called the labyrinth, which includes the semicircular canals, contains specialized cells that detect motion and changes in position. Injury to or diseases of the inner ear can send false signals to the brain indicating that the balance mechanism of the inner ear (labyrinth) detects motion. If these false signals conflict with signals from the other balance and positioning centers of the body, vertigo may occur. Common causes of vertigo include: Inner ear disorders, such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Meniere's disease, vestibular neuritis, or labyrinthitis. Migraine headaches, which are painful, debilitating headaches that often occur with vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, noise, and smell. Decreased blood flow through the arteries that supply blood to the base of the brain (vertebrobasilar insufficiency). Less common causes of vertigo include: A noncancerous growth in the space behind the eardrum (cholesteatoma). Brain tumors and cancer that has traveled from another part of the body (metastatic). Immediate medical attention is needed if vertigo occurs suddenly with a change in speech or vision or other loss of function.

Ventricular tachycardia is a fast heart rhythm that starts in the lower part of the heart (ventricles). If left untreated, some forms of ventricular tachycardia may get worse and lead to ventricular fibrillation, which can be life-threatening. It can lead to ventricular fibrillation, which is fast and irregular. With ventricular fibrillation, the heartbeats are so fast and irregular that the heart stops pumping blood. Sometimes it is not known what causes ventricular tachycardia, especially when it occurs in young people. But in most cases ventricular tachycardia is caused by heart disease, such as a previous heart attack, a congenital heart defect, hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy, or myocarditis. Sometimes ventricular tachycardia occurs after heart surgery. Inherited heart rhythm problems, such as long QT syndrome or Brugada syndrome, are rare causes of ventricular tachycardia. Some medicines-including antiarrhythmic medicines, which are used to treat other types of abnormal heart rhythms-can cause ventricular tachycardia. Illegal drugs (such as stimulants, like cocaine) also may cause ventricular tachycardia. In ventricular tachycardia, the heart beats too rapidly and the ventricles cannot effectively pump oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body. If an electrocardiogram (EKG, ECG) can be done while ventricular tachycardia is occurring, it often provides the most useful information. An electrocardiogram is a tracing of the electrical activity of your heart. Because ventricular tachycardia can occur intermittently and may not always be captured by an EKG at the doctor's office, you may be asked to use a portable EKG to record your heart rhythm on a continuous basis, usually over a 24-hour period. This is referred to by several names, including ambulatory electrocardiography, ambulatory EKG, Holter monitoring, 24-hour EKG, or cardiac event monitoring. Your doctor may recommend further tests, including an echocardiogram, to evaluate your heart's function, a stress test or coronary angiogram to determine whether a part of the heart is not getting enough blood, and/or an electrophysiology (EP) study. An EP study can locate specific areas of heart tissue that give rise to abnormal electrical impulses, which may be causing the ventricular tachycardia. Paramedics or your doctor may try intravenous medicines or electrical cardioversion to return your heart to a normal rhythm. To prevent the arrhythmia from recurring, you may need to take antiarrhythmic medicines. Your doctor might recommend an implanted device, called an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). An ICD can detect an abnormal heart rhythm and restore a normal rhythm. In some cases a procedure called catheter ablation is used to destroy small areas of heart tissue responsible for the arrhythmia. Catheter ablation might make the arrhythmia happen less often or stop the arrhythmia from happening again.1 It is very important that any causes of ventricular tachycardia be identified and treated, if possible. For example, if the ventricular tachycardia results from a medicine, the medicine needs to be stopped. If you want to lose weight, do not use diets that rely on a liquid-based program or a high-protein regimen. If you have had an episode of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, your doctor may recommend that you don't drive a car for a few months. Right after you get an ICD implanted, you will not drive for at least a few days. For example, plan to wear a medical alert bracelet and to bring enough medicine for the length of your trip. This includes getting your device checked regularly, avoiding strong electric or magnetic fields, exercising safely, and knowing what to do if you get a shock."], [1145, "Ventricular Septal Defects", "Ventricular septal defects are heart defects that are present at birth (congenital). The aorta, the main vessel of arterial circulation, carries blood from the left ventricle and away from the heart. Small ventricular septal defects can close on their own; (spontaneously) or become less significant as the child matures and grows. Moderately-sized defects can cause congestive heart failure, which is characterized by an abnormally rapid rate of breathing (tachypnea), wheezing, unusually fast heartbeat (tachycardia), enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), and/or failure to thrive.

NDI is not related to the more common diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes), in which the body does not produce or properly use insulin. NDI is a distinct disorder caused by complete or partial resistance of the kidneys to arginine vasopressin (AVP). NDI causes chronic excessive thirst (polydipsia), excessive urine production (polyuria), and potentially dehydration. NDI may also be acquired during life as a result of drug use (e.g., lithium therapy), kidney disease, obstruction of the tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder (ureters), and prolonged metabolic imbalances such as low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia) or high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia). NDI may also be a temporary complication associated with pregnancy. NDI is different from central diabetes insipidus, which is a rare disorder characterized by the inability of the body to produce vasopressin (rather than vasopressin resistance as in NDI)."], [1148, "Vasculitis, Cutaneous Necrotizing", "Cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis (CNV) is characterized by inflammation and tissue damage (necrosis) of blood vessel walls (lumen) and associated skin (cutaneous) lesions.

CNV is one of a larger group of disorders involving inflammation and blood vessels known as the vasculitides or the vasculitic syndromes."], [1149, "Vasculitis", "Vasculitis is a general term that refers to inflammation of blood vessels. When blood vessels become inflamed, they may become weakened, stretch, and either increase in size or become narrow -- even to the point of closing entirely. Vasculitis can affect people of all ages, but there are types of vasculitis that occur in certain age groups more often than others. Some of the many forms of vasculitis may be restricted to particular organs. Some of these generalized forms may be quite mild and may not require treatment. In a few cases, however, the origins may be traced to recent or ongoing infections, such as those caused by certain viruses. Vasculitis also may be related to other diseases of the immune system that the person has had for months or years. For example, it could be a complication of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or Sjogren's syndrome. In an extreme situation, when a segment of a blood vessel becomes weakened, it may then stretch and bulge (called an aneurysm). The wall of the blood vessel can become so weak that it ruptures and bleeds, possibly causing death. If a blood vessel becomes inflamed and narrowed, the blood supply to the area of the body it serves may be partially or completely blocked. If alternate blood vessels (called collateral blood vessels) are not available in sufficient quantity to carry the blood to such sites, the tissue supplied by the affected vessels will die. An enormous number of vasculitis symptoms are possible because any organ system may be involved. Vasculitis in the brain may cause a stroke, or in the heart, may result in a heart attack. Sometimes the symptoms may be as general as fever, loss of appetite, weight loss, and loss of energy. When vasculitis is the result of an allergic reaction, it may go away on its own and not require treatment. Chemotherapy drugs (such as those used to treat cancer) are also used, but in doses usually lower than people with cancer may receive. Tocilizumab is given as an injection under the skin to lower the dose of steroids that a person needs. In the past, people with severe vasculitis may have expected to survive only weeks or months. The success of treatment is related to prompt diagnosis, aggressive treatment and careful follow-up to be sure that side effects from medications do not develop. Once vasculitis is under control, medications may be cautiously withdrawn, with the hope that the patient will sustain a long remission or cure, without the need for further treatment. Because doctors cannot predict how long a person may remain in remission, it is very important for people with more severe forms of vasculitis to continue under the care of a knowledgeable doctor for the rest of their lives."], [1150, "Vascular Malformations of the Brain", "As the name suggests, vascular malformations of the brain is an umbrella term for at least six conditions in which blood vessels of the brain are affected.

Vascular malformations are typically classified by size, location, and type of change, with the four most common being capillary telangiectasias, cavernous malformations, venous malformations, and arteriovenous malformations. Leakage (bleeding) from these vascular lesions is the underlying cause of clinical symptoms associated with the illness. Cavernous malformations are primarily located in the brain, but can also be found in the spinal cord, on the skin, and more rarely in the retina. CCM are present in up to 0.5% of the general population, and they account for a large proportion (8-15%) of all brain and spinal vascular malformations. While the prevalence of individuals with at least one CCM lesion is quite high, as many as 40% of affected individual may never experience symptoms or become diagnosed with cavernous malformation. Individuals with the familial (genetic) form of cavernous malformation are likely to have multiple lesions and may be more likely to experience symptoms associated with the disorder. While adults are most often diagnosed with CCM, people of all ages may be affected by cavernous malformations, and approximately 25% of all diagnosed cavernous malformations are found in children. CCM lesions are commonly associated with developmental venous anomalies (DVA) also called, venous malformations or venous angiomas. However, when found in combination with a CCM lesion, the DVA complicates the option for surgical intervention because disturbing the DVA during surgery could cause dangerous bleeding. Association of CCMs with DVAs is uncommon in familial cavernous malformation; however, at least 40% of sporadic cavernous malformations may develop within the vicinity of a DVA. The significance of DVA association with sporadic lesions is currently under investigation; perhaps this observation may suggest a difference in developmental mechanisms between sporadic and familial cavernous malformations."], [1152, "Vascular Dementia, Binswanger's Type", "Binswanger disease is a progressive neurological disorder caused by arteriosclerosis and thromboembolism affecting the blood vessels that supply the white-matter and deep structures of the brain (basal ganglia and thalamus).

A catheter is often inserted in the arm or chest through the skin into a large vein. The catheter is threaded through this vein until it reaches a large vein near the heart. A catheter may be inserted into the neck if it will be used only during a hospital stay. Central venous catheters are used to: Give long-term medicine treatment for pain, infection, or cancer, or to supply nutrition. A central venous catheter can be left in place far longer than an intravenous catheter (IV), which gives medicines into a vein near the skin surface. Give medicines that affect the heart, especially if a quick response to the medicine is wanted. Give large amounts of blood or fluid quickly. Take frequent blood samples without having to \"stick\" someone with a needle. A central venous catheter can be left in place far longer than an intravenous catheter (IV), which gives medicines into a vein near the skin surface. Also, a central venous catheter allows a person to receive IV medicines at home. There are several types of central venous catheters. A peripherally inserted central catheter, or PICC line (say \"pick\"), is a central venous catheter inserted into a vein in the arm rather than a vein in the neck or chest. This type of catheter is surgically inserted into a vein in the neck or chest and passed under the skin. Medicines can be given through an opening in this end of the catheter. This type is similar to a tunneled catheter but is left entirely under the skin. An implanted port is less obvious than a tunneled catheter and requires very little daily care. It has less impact on a person's activities than a PICC line or a tunneled catheter. Possible complications from the use of a central venous catheter include: Bleeding, caused by inserting the catheter into the vein. Infection, requiring treatment with antibiotics or removal of the catheter. This can happen from a blood clot or from something else getting stuck in the line. Regular flushing of the catheter can help keep the line clear. Preventing infections and making sure the catheter is in place can also help keep the line clear. A twisted or kinked catheter must be repositioned or replaced. The risk of a collapsed lung varies with the skill of the person inserting the catheter and the site of placement. It is most likely to happen during placement of a catheter in the chest, although the risk is small. A catheter that has moved out of place can sometimes be repositioned. Your nurses will teach you how to take care of your catheter. You can take steps at home to care for your catheter: Always wash your hands before you touch your central line. Fasten or tape the central line to your body to prevent it from pulling or dangling. Avoid bending or crimping your central line. And wear clothing that doesn't rub or pull on your central line. You have sudden chest pain and shortness of breath, or you cough up blood. Call your doctor now or seek immediate medical care if: You have signs of infection, such as: Increased pain, swelling, warmth, or redness.Red streaks leading from the exit site.Pus or blood draining from the exit site. You have swelling in your face, chest, neck, or arm on the side where the central line is. You have signs of a blood clot, such as bulging veins near the catheter.

But thanks to global immunization programs, the deadly infectious disease was wiped out in the late 1970s. Today, scientists keep only a small amount of the virus alive under tightly controlled conditions in the U.S. and Russia for medical research. Routine smallpox vaccinations stopped in the U.S. and in many other countries in 1972, and in all other World Health Organization member countries by 1986. The more dangerous form, variola major, led to smallpox disease that killed about 30% of people who were infected. You get it mainly by breathing in the virus during close, face-to-face contact with an infected person. It usually spreads through drops of saliva when the person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. Smallpox also can spread when someone handles the clothes or sheets of an infected person or comes into contact with their body fluids. Very rarely, smallpox has spread among people in small, enclosed spaces, probably through air in the ventilation system. Once a person is infected with the virus, 7 to 17 days can pass before they have any symptoms. During this time, the person isn't contagious and can't spread the virus to others. Smallpox gets its name from its most common sign of the disease: small blisters that pop up on the face, arms, and body, and fill up with pus. Other symptoms include: Flu-like fatigue, headache, body aches, and sometimes vomiting High fever Mouth sores and blisters that spread the virus into the throat A skin rash that gets worse in a typical pattern: The rash starts with flat red sores that become raised bumps a few days later.The bumps turn into fluid-filled blisters.The blisters fill with pus.They crust over, usually in the second week of smallpox.Scabs form over the blisters and then fall off, usually in the third week of the disease. The rash starts with flat red sores that become raised bumps a few days later. Scabs form over the blisters and then fall off, usually in the third week of the disease. Blindness can happen when blisters form near the eyes. Getting the vaccine within 3 to 4 days of contact with the virus may make the disease less severe or maybe help prevent it. Beyond that, medical care aims to ease symptoms like fever and body aches, and control any other illnesses that a person can get when their immune system is weak. Scientists are still looking for antiviral medicines that could treat the disease. The vaccine prompts the body's immune system to make the tools, called antibodies, it needs to protect against the variola virus and help prevent smallpox disease. Since it may not give lifelong protection, anyone vaccinated years ago as a child could be at risk of future infection by the variola virus. It's rarely used today, except for those few people who are around the variola virus, such as laboratory researchers working with variola and viruses like it. They can range from skin reactions to a serious nervous system condition called encephalitis, which can lead to convulsions, coma, and death. Some people would have a higher risk of a reaction to the vaccine, like: Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding People with skin disorders such as eczema People with a weak immune system due to a medical condition like leukemia or HIV People on medical treatments, such as for cancer, that make the immune system weak It's hard to know how major a threat a smallpox outbreak would be today. There are a few reasons that scientists can't be sure: The number of people around the world with weakened immune systems is higher today than when smallpox existed. If an outbreak of smallpox were to happen, public health measures would likely include these steps: find and vaccinate infected people, vaccinate health care workers and others at risk of infection, isolate smallpox patients to keep them from spreading the disease, and give vaccinations for the public as needed to contain the outbreak."], [1156, "Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD)", "Mad cow disease is a fatal disease that slowly destroys the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) in cattle.

This can happen if you eat nerve tissue (the brain and spinal cord) of cattle that were infected with mad cow disease. There is no evidence that people can get mad cow disease or vCJD from eating muscle meat-which is used for ground beef, roasts, and steaks-or from consuming milk or milk products. People who have spent a lot of time (at least 3 months) in places where mad cow disease has been found are not allowed to give blood in the United States or Canada.2, 1 This is to help prevent vCJD from spreading. Experts are not sure what causes mad cow disease or vCJD. In affected cows, these proteins are found in the brain, spinal cord, and small intestine. There is no proof that prions are found in muscle meat (such as steak) or in milk. When a cow is slaughtered, parts of it are used for human food and other parts are used in animal feed. People can get vCJD if they eat the brain or spinal cord tissue of infected cattle. Most of the cases have been in countries that are part of the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland). In December 2003, mad cow disease was discovered in one cow in the United States. Before this cow was found to have the disease, the cow was slaughtered and its muscle meat was sent to be sold in grocery stores. Although mad cow disease cannot be spread through muscle meat, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) quickly traced the meat and removed it from grocery stores. Since 2004, only three more cows in the United States have been found to have mad cow disease. The most recent case of BSE was found in April 2012 in a cow in California.

Areas commonly affected by GSD include the ribs, spine, pelvis, skull, collarbone (clavicle), and the jaws (maxillofacial area). Bones affected by GSD are prone to reduced bone mass (osteopenia) and fracture. Introduction While GSD mainly involves the musculoskeletal system, it can involve the viscera, and is closely related to generalized lymphatic anomaly (GLA, also known as lymphangiomatosis). Lymphatic malformations are rare non-malignant masses consisting of fluid-filled channels or spaces thought to be caused by the abnormal development of the lymphatic system, which includes lymph nodes, the small nodules where certain white blood cells (lymphocytes) and other cells participate in the immune regulatory system of the body. The lymphatic system consists of a network of tubular channels (lymph vessels) that transport lymph back into the bloodstream. As lymph moves through the lymphatic system, it passes through the network of lymph nodes that help the body to deactivate sources of infection (e.g., viruses, bacteria, etc.) Groups of lymph nodes are located throughout the body, including in the neck, under the arms (axillae), at the elbows, and in the chest, abdomen, and groin. The lymphatic system also includes the spleen, which filters worn-out red blood cells and produces lymphocytes; and bone marrow, which is the spongy tissue inside the cavities of bones that manufactures blood cells. Lymphatic malformations can affect any area of the body (except the brain), but most commonly affect the head and neck. When lymphatic malformations are widespread in bone and soft tissue, the term \"lymphangiomatosis\" is used. However, definition of the term \"lymphangiomatosis\" is controversial - if it doesn't involve bone or cortical bone is preserved it will be called GLA. GSD is sometimes classified as a form of lymphangiomatosis. In 1954, L.

But if they become resistant to antibiotics, they can cause serious infections, especially in people who are ill or weak. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci infections are treated with antibiotics, which are the types of medicines normally used to kill bacteria. VRE infections are more difficult to treat than other infections with enterococci, because fewer antibiotics can kill the bacteria. VRE, like many bacteria, can be spread from one person to another through casual contact or through contaminated objects. Most often, VRE infections are spread from the hands of health care workers to a patient in a hospital or other facility such as a nursing home. VRE infections are not usually spread through the air like the common cold or flu virus unless you have VRE pneumonia and are coughing, which is rare. If you are healthy, your chances of getting a VRE infection are very low. Even if you have been exposed to VRE, or have VRE in your body, you are not likely to get an infection. VRE infections typically only occur among people who have weakened immune systems, such as people who have long-term illnesses or people who have had major surgery or other medical procedures and have been treated with multiple antibiotics. Experts do not know exactly why some people become infected with VRE and others do not. The symptoms of a VRE infection depend on where the infection is. If VRE are causing a wound infection, that area of your skin may be red or tender. Some people with VRE infections have diarrhea, feel weak and sick, or have fever and chills. If your doctor suspects that you are infected with VRE, he or she will send a sample of your infected wound, blood, urine, or stool to a lab. If you get a serious infection with VRE, you may be isolated in a private hospital room to reduce the chances of spreading the bacteria to others. VRE infections may be difficult to cure because the bacteria do not respond to many antibiotics. If you have an infection, your doctor will order antibiotics that may be given by mouth or into a vein through an IV (intravenously). Part of your treatment may include sending samples of your blood, urine, or stool to a lab to see if you still have VRE in your body. Some people get rid of VRE infections on their own as their bodies get stronger. As more antibiotic-resistant bacteria develop and more cases of VRE infections are documented, hospitals and other health care facilities are taking extra care to practice infection control, which includes frequent hand-washing and isolation of patients infected with VRE.

At birth, a baby passes out of the body through the vagina (also called the birth canal). The organs in the female reproductive system include the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina. There are two main types of vaginal cancer: Squamous cell carcinoma: Cancer that forms in squamous cells, the thin, flat cells lining the vagina. Squamous cell vaginal cancer spreads slowly and usually stays near the vagina, but may spread to the lungs, liver, or bone. Glandular cells in the lining of the vagina make and release fluids such as mucus. Age and being exposed to the drug DES (diethylstilbestrol) before birth affect a woman's risk of vaginal cancer. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Risk factors for vaginal cancer include the following: Being aged 60 or older. In the 1950s, the drug DES was given to some pregnant women to prevent miscarriage (premature birth of a fetus that cannot survive). Having a history of abnormal cells in the cervix or cervical cancer. Having a history of abnormal cells in the uterus or cancer of the uterus. Signs and symptoms of vaginal cancer include pain or abnormal vaginal bleeding. It may be found during a routine pelvic exam and Pap test. Signs and symptoms may be caused by vaginal cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following: Bleeding or discharge not related to menstrual periods. Tests that examine the vagina and other organs in the pelvis are used to detect (find) and diagnose vaginal cancer. The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Pelvic exam: An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum. The doctor or nurse inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. A speculum is also inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. A Pap test or Pap smear of the cervix is usually done.

Pap test: A procedure to collect cells from the surface of the cervix and vagina. A piece of cotton, a brush, or a small wooden stick is used to gently scrape cells from the cervix and vagina. Colposcopy : A procedure in which a colposcope (a lighted, magnifying instrument) is used to check the vagina and cervix for abnormal areas. Tissue samples may be taken using a curette (spoon-shaped instrument) and checked under a microscope for signs of disease. Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues from the vagina and cervix so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. If a Pap test shows abnormal cells in the vagina, a biopsy may be done during a colposcopy.

If you and your doctor agree to try a VBAC, you will have what is called a \"trial of labor after cesarean,\" or TOLAC. This means that you plan to go into labor with the goal to deliver vaginally. But as in any labor, it is hard to know if a VBAC will work. As many as 4 out of 10 women who have a trial of labor need to have a C-section.1 Having a vaginal birth after having a C-section can be a safe choice for most women. Whether it is right for you depends on several things, including why you had a C-section before and how many C-sections you've had. You and your doctor can talk about your risk for having problems during a trial of labor. The benefits of a VBAC compared to a C-section include: Avoiding another scar on your uterus. The more scars you have on your uterus, the greater the chance of problems with a later pregnancy. A more active role for you and your birthing partner in the birth of your child. The most serious risk of a trial of labor is that a C-section scar could come open during labor. This risk is why VBAC is often only offered by hospitals that can do a rapid emergency C-section.

You could also have an infection without any symptoms. It doesn't really have a smell or make you itch. At one point, you may have only a small amount of a very thin or watery discharge, and at another time of the month, it's thicker and there's more of it. When discharge has a very noticeable odor, or burns or itches, that's likely a problem. You might feel an irritation any time of the day, but it's most often bothersome at night. You should call your doctor when: Your vaginal discharge changes color, is heavier, or smells different. Two of the most common causes are related to organisms that live in your vagina. Yeast infections are an overgrowth of the yeast that you normally have in your body. Bacterial vaginosis happens when the balance of bacteria is thrown off. With both conditions, you may notice white or grayish discharge. If your discharge looks like cottage cheese, a yeast infection may be to blame. You can get vaginal infections through sexual contact, too: Chlamydia Gonorrhea Herpes simplex virus Human papilloma virus (HPV) or genital warts Trichomoniasis Women may not have obvious symptoms of these STDs. If you're sexually active (especially if you have multiple partners), you should talk to your doctor about getting tested for them at your annual checkup. Sometimes itching, burning, and even discharge happen without an infection. Most often, it's an allergic reaction to or irritation from products such as: Detergents Douches Fabric softeners Perfumed soaps Spermicides Vaginal sprays It could also be from a lower level of hormones because of menopause or because you've had your ovaries removed. This can make your vagina dry, a condition called atrophic vaginitis. Sexual intercourse could be painful, and you may notice vaginal itching and burning. The key to treating vaginal infections effectively is getting the right diagnosis. Some doctors will ask you to not have sex during the 24-48 hours before your appointment. It's better to see your doctor before you try over-the-counter medications, even if you're pretty sure you know what you have. You treat non-infectious vaginitis by dealing with the probable cause. For hormonal changes, your doctor may prescribe estrogen to ease symptoms. But doctors don't recommend vaginal sprays or heavily perfumed soaps for this area. Douching may cause irritation, too, and more importantly, could hide or spread an infection. Nylon underwear, tight jeans, non-breathable gym shorts and leggings, and pantyhose without a cotton panel can lead to yeast infections.

Changes in urination, such as having to urinate more frequently or having a burning feeling when you urinate, also may be a symptom of a vaginal problem. Conditions that may cause a change in your normal vaginal discharge include: Infections of the vagina, such as a yeast infection, bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, human papillomavirus (HPV), or herpes. Various sex practices, such as oral-to-vaginal and anal-to-vaginal contact. The severity of your pain and other symptoms you have may help determine what is causing the pain. For example: A condition, such as functional ovarian cysts , may cause pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding when you are not having your period. Douching changes the normal balance of bacteria in the vagina. Douching may flush an infection up into your uterus or fallopian tubes and cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The presence or excess growth of yeast cells, bacteria, or viruses can cause a vaginal infection.

Because coronary heart disease is the leading killer of women in the United States, being a proactive patient may very well save your life. The cholesterol-rich plaque that builds up on the walls of heart arteries -- and that leads to coronary heart disease and heart attacks -- starts to form in early childhood and builds over a lifetime. When blood can no longer squeeze through the plaque-narrowed artery or when high blood pressure causes the artery to burst, a heart attack occurs. While you can change some risk factors for heart disease -- high blood pressure, poor diet, uncontrolled diabetes, and inactivity, for example -- there are others you can't, like genetics and age. The more risk factors you have -- if you're an overweight smoker with high blood pressure, for example -- the higher your chances of having a heart attack. Don't be shy about starting the discussion about heart health with your doctor and asking for appropriate testing and treatment. \"Preventing heart disease before it occurs or leads to a heart attack is the best solution,\" says Goldberg. Smokers are twice as likely to have a heart attack as nonsmokers, says the AHA. Many studies show that smoking is a major cause of coronary heart disease, which leads to heart attack. If you have trouble giving up smoking on your own, ask your doctor to recommend smoking cessation programs. If it's high (above 200), have it tested more often, and work with your doctor to reduce it with medication, dietary changes, and exercise. High blood pressure is a serious condition that silently makes the heart work harder, weakening artery walls and encouraging plaque attachment. Exercise regularly: Most women don't get nearly enough exercise to promote a healthy heart. The AHA recommends no fewer than three to four sessions per week, at least 30 minutes each. Maintain a healthy weight: A body mass index (BMI) of between 21 and 25 is ideal, according to the AHA. If your BMI is above 25, you may be at increased risk for heart disease, and you might want to stick to a sensible diet to bring your weight within the recommended range. Control your diabetes: Diabetes raises your risk of heart disease, especially if you are careless with your medication or diet. Consider hormone replacement therapy: Women are at greater risk of heart attacks after menopause. \"Heart attacks often strike with little warning,\" says David Herrington, MD, associate professor of medicine and cardiology at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C. \"Knowing the signs of an attack can help you recognize the emergency and get lifesaving treatment in time.\" The most common signs of a heart attack, according to the AHA are: Uncomfortable pressure, fullness, squeezing, or pain in the center of the chest lasting more than a few minutes Pain spreading to the shoulders, neck, or arms Chest discomfort with lightheadedness, fainting, sweating, nausea, or shortness of breath Women often experience these signs: Atypical chest pain, stomach, or abdominal pain Nausea or dizziness Shortness of breath and difficulty breathing Unexplained anxiety, weakness, or fatigue Palpitations, cold sweat, or paleness If you have any of the above symptoms, seek medical attention immediately and assertively ask for tests used to diagnose a heart attack, says Herrington."], [1185, "Wolfram Syndrome", "All people affected by Wolfram syndrome have juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus and degeneration of the optic nerve (optic atrophy).

When wisdom teeth are misaligned, they may position themselves horizontally, be angled toward or away from the second molars, or be angled inward or outward. Poor alignment of wisdom teeth can crowd or damage adjacent teeth, the jawbone, or nerves. Partial eruption of the wisdom teeth allows an opening for bacteria to enter around the tooth and cause an infection, which results in pain, swelling, jaw stiffness, and general illness. He or she may take an X-ray periodically to evaluate for the presence and alignment of your wisdom teeth. Your dentist may also decide to send you to an oral surgeon for further evaluation. Your dentist or oral surgeon may recommend that your wisdom teeth be extracted even before problems develop. This is done to avoid a more painful or more complicated extraction that might have to be done a few years later. In older people, recovery and healing time tend to be longer. The relative ease at which your dentist or oral surgeon can extract your wisdom teeth depends on their position and stage of development. Your oral health care provider will be able to give you an idea of what to expect during your pre-extraction exam. A wisdom tooth that is fully erupted through the gum can be extracted as easily as any other tooth. However, a wisdom tooth that is underneath the gums and embedded in the jawbone will require an incision into the gums and then removal of the portion of bone that lies over the tooth. Often, for a tooth in this situation, the tooth will be extracted in small sections rather than removed in one piece to minimize the amount of bone that needs to be removed to get the tooth out. Before your wisdom teeth are pulled, the teeth and the surrounding tissue will be numbed with a local anesthetic -- the same type used to numb a tooth prior to having a cavity filled. In addition to the local anesthetic to numb the pain, you and your dentist or oral surgeon may decide that a sedative is desired to control any anxiety. Sedating medications that could be selected include: nitrous oxide (otherwise known as \"laughing gas\"), an oral sedative (for example, Valium), or an intravenous sedative (administered via an injection into your veins). After having your wisdom teeth removed, the speed of your recovery depends on the degree of difficulty of the extraction (a simple extraction of a fully erupted tooth versus a tooth impacted into the jawbone). The tannic acid in tea helps healing blood clots to form (blood clots function similarly to scab over an open wound). Repeat this process if a small degree of bleeding continues; if heavy bleeding continues to occur, contact your dentist or oral surgeon. Avoid rinsing or spitting for 24 hours after tooth extraction, avoid \"sucking\" actions (for example, don't drink beverages through straws or smoke) and avoid hot liquids (such as coffee or soup). These activities can dislodge the clot, causing a dry socket (see below) to develop. To minimize swelling, place a piece of ice, wrapped in a cloth, on that area of your face on a schedule of 10 minutes on, followed by 20 minutes off. Pain medications, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin or Advil), can be taken for minor pain. Your dentist or oral surgeon may prescribe more potent pain relievers, if necessary. Antibiotics that may have been prescribed prior to tooth extraction (to treat any active infection around the wisdom tooth to be extracted) should continue to be taken until the full prescription is gone. Continue to brush your teeth, but avoid the teeth directly neighboring the extracted tooth during the first 24 hours. Rinse your mouth with warm salt water (1/2 teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water) after meals and before bed. Stitches , if used and if not of the self-dissolving type, need to be removed by your oral health care provider in about 1 week. However, usually within the first week or two, enough healing has taken place for use of your mouth to be reasonably comfortable in the area of the extraction. Two of the more important complications after having your wisdom teeth removed include: Dry socket. When it happens, dry socket typically occurs 3 or 4 days following the extraction and is accompanied by pain (ranging from \"dull\" to moderate to severe) and a foul mouth odor. Your dentist or oral surgeon will treat the dry socket by placing medication in the socket. Sometimes these nerves can be bruised or damaged during the tooth removal process. The result is a numbness (called a paresthesia) of the tongue, lip, or chin that can last a few days, weeks, months, or may even be permanent. Because costs vary in different areas of the country, contact your dentist or oral surgeon for their charges.

Most people with SAD start to have symptoms in September or October and feel better by April or May. It can sometimes be hard to tell the difference between SAD and other types of depression because many of the symptoms are the same. To diagnose SAD, your doctor will ask if: You have been depressed during the same season and have gotten better when the seasons changed for at least 2 years in a row. You have symptoms that often occur with SAD, such as being very hungry (especially craving carbohydrates), gaining weight, and sleeping more than usual. A close relative-a parent, brother, or sister-has had SAD. You may need to have blood tests to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as low thyroid (hypothyroidism). Light therapy is the main treatment for SAD. It helps most people who have SAD, and it's easy to use. For this treatment, you place the light box at a certain distance from you on a desk or table. For this treatment, a dim light goes on in the morning while you sleep, and it gets brighter over time, like a sunrise. Talk to your doctor about light therapy, and follow the steps that he or she recommends. Ultraviolet lights, full-spectrum lights, tanning lamps, and heat lamps should not be used. Light therapy is usually prescribed for 30 minutes to 2 hours a day. The amount of time depends on how strong the light is and on whether you are starting out or are have been using it for a while. But you need to stay with it and use it every day until the season changes. The most common ones prescribed for SAD include: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as paroxetine (Paxil) and sertraline (Zoloft). Other antidepressants, such as bupropion (Wellbutrin) and venlafaxine (Effexor). If your doctor prescribes an antidepressant, be sure you take it the way you're told to. When you are ready to stop, your doctor can help you slowly reduce the dose to prevent problems. Some types of counseling, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy, can help you learn more about SAD, how to manage your symptoms, and how to help prevent future episodes.. Getting more sunlight may help too, so try to get outside to exercise when the sun is shining. Being active during the daytime, especially early in the day, may help you have more energy and feel less depressed. Moderate exercise such as walking, riding a stationary bike, or swimming is a great way to get started. Try to do muscle-building exercises at least 2 times each week, such as weight training or stair climbing. One example is melatonin, a hormone that may help regulate your biological clock."], [1190, "Winchester Syndrome", "Winchester syndrome is an extremely rare connective tissue disorder believed by some scientists to be closely related to the mucopolysaccharidoses, which is a group of hereditary metabolic diseases caused by the absence or malfunction of certain enzymes, leading to the accumulation in cells and tissues of molecules that would normally be broken down into smaller units. This syndrome is characterized by short stature, arthritis-like symptoms, nodules under the skin (subcutaneous), coarse facial features, and eye and teeth abnormalities."], [1191, "Wilson's Disease", "Wilson's disease is a rare genetic disorder characterized by excess copper stored in various body tissues, particularly the liver, brain, and corneas of the eyes.

Tiny tubules in the kidneys filter and clean the blood. Anatomy of the female urinary system showing the kidneys, adrenal glands, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Urine is made in the renal tubules and collects in the renal pelvis of each kidney. Most childhood kidney cancers are Wilms tumors, but in children 15 to 19 years old, renal cell cancer is more common. Renal Cell Cancer (RCC) Renal cell cancer is rare in children and adolescents younger than 15 years old. Rhabdoid Tumor of the Kidney Rhabdoid tumor of the kidney is a type of kidney cancer that occurs mostly in infants and young children. Rhabdoid tumor of the kidney grows and spreads quickly, often to the lungs or brain. Children with a certain gene change are checked regularly to see if a rhabdoid tumor has formed in the kidney or has spread to the brain: Children younger than one year old have an ultrasound of the abdomen every two to three months and an ultrasound of the brain every month. Clear Cell Sarcoma of the Kidney Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney is a type of kidney tumor that may spread to the lung, bone, brain, or soft tissue. Congenital Mesoblastic Nephroma Congenital mesoblastic nephroma is a tumor of the kidney that is often diagnosed during the first year of life. Ewing Sarcoma (Neuroepithelial Tumor) of the Kidney Ewing sarcoma (neuroepithelial tumor) of the kidney is rare and usually occurs in young adults. Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor of the Kidney Desmoplastic small round cell tumor of the kidney is a rare soft tissue sarcoma. Cystic Partially Differentiated Nephroblastoma Cystic partially differentiated nephroblastoma is a very rare type of Wilms tumor made up of cysts. Multilocular Cystic Nephroma Multilocular cystic nephromas are benign tumors made up of cysts. Primary Renal Synovial Sarcoma Primary renal synovial sarcoma is a rare tumor of the kidney and is most common in young adults. Anaplastic Sarcoma of the Kidney Anaplastic sarcoma of the kidney is a rare tumor that is most common in children or adolescents younger than 15 years of age. Sometimes, after the kidneys form in the fetus, abnormal groups of kidney cells remain in one or both kidneys. In nephroblastomatosis, these abnormal groups of cells may grow in many places inside the kidney or make a thick layer around the kidney. When these groups of abnormal cells are found in a kidney that was removed for Wilms tumor, the child has an increased risk of Wilms tumor in the other kidney. Anything that increases the risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. A genetic syndrome is a set of signs and symptoms or conditions that occur together and is caused by certain changes in the genes. These and other genetic syndromes and conditions have been linked to Wilms tumor: WAGR syndrome (Wilms tumor, aniridia, abnormal genitourinary system, and mental retardation). Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (abnormally large growth of one side of the body or a body part, large tongue, umbilical hernia at birth, and abnormal genitourinary system). Isolated hemihypertrophy (abnormally large growth of one side of the body or a body part). Aniridia (the iris, the colored part of the eye, is missing). A test to check the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level in the blood and an ultrasound of the abdomen are done until the child is 4 years old. These often appear when Wilms tumor is first diagnosed, but Wilms tumor may also occur in the second kidney after the child is successfully treated for Wilms tumor in one kidney. A second tumor is much more likely to develop in the other kidney when a child's first Wilms tumor is diagnosed before they are one year old or when embryonic cells remain in the kidney. Children with an increased risk of a second Wilms tumor in the other kidney should be screened for Wilms tumor every three months for two to six years. Renal cell cancer may be related to the following conditions: Von Hippel-Lindau disease (an inherited condition that causes abnormal growth of blood vessels). Children with Von Hippel-Lindau disease should be checked yearly for renal cell cancer with an ultrasound of the abdomen or an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) beginning at age 8 to 11 years. Tuberous sclerosis (an inherited disease marked by noncancerous fatty cysts in the kidney). Familial renal cell cancer (an inherited condition that occurs when certain changes in the genes that cause kidney cancer are passed down from the parent to the child). Renal medullary cancer (a rare kidney cancer that grows and spreads quickly). Hereditary leiomyomatosis (an inherited disorder that increases the risk of having cancer of the kidney, skin, and uterus). Second cancers (renal cell cancer may occur several years after treatment for neuroblastoma). Genetic counseling (a discussion with a trained professional about genetic diseases and whether genetic testing is needed) may be needed if the child has one of the following syndromes or conditions: A genetic syndrome or condition that increases the risk of Wilms tumor. An inherited condition that increases the risk of renal cell cancer. Signs of Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors include a lump in the abdomen and blood in the urine. Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following: A lump, swelling, or pain in the abdomen. High blood pressure (headache, feeling very tired, chest pain, or trouble seeing or breathing). Hypercalcemia (loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, weakness, or feeling very tired). Wilms tumor that has spread to the lungs or liver may cause the following signs and symptoms: Cough. Tests that examine the kidney and the blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors. The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells. The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells. The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells. Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that makes it. This test is done to check how well the liver and kidneys are working. Renal function test: A procedure in which blood or urine samples are checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood or urine by the kidneys. A higher or lower than normal amount of a substance can be a sign that the kidneys are not working as they should. Urinalysis : A test to check the color of urine and its contents, such as sugar, protein, blood, and bacteria. Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, taken from different angles. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium: A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). X-ray of the abdomen: An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. PET-CT scan: A procedure that combines the pictures from a positron emission tomography (PET) scan and a computed tomography (CT) scan. A PET scan is a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The decision to do a biopsy is based on one or more of the following: The size of the tumor.The stage of the cancer.Whether cancer is in one or both kidneys.Whether imaging tests clearly show the cancer.Whether the tumor can be removed by surgery.Whether the patient is in a clinical trial. A biopsy may be done before any treatment is given, after chemotherapy to shrink the tumor, or after surgery to remove the tumor. Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for Wilms tumor depend on the following: How different the tumor cells are from normal kidney cells when looked at under a microscope. The prognosis for renal cell cancer depends on the following: The stage of the cancer. The prognosis for rhabdoid tumor of the kidney depends on the following: The age of the child when cancer is diagnosed. The prognosis for clear cell sarcoma of the kidney depends on the following: The age of the child when cancer is diagnosed."], [1193, "Wilms Tumor and Pseudohermaphroditism", "Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS) is characterized by abnormal kidney function (congenital nephropathy), a cancerous tumor of the kidney called Wilms tumor, and disorders of sexual development in affected males.

In childhood, features of this disorder include short stature, small genitals and an excessive appetite because affected individuals do not feel satisfied after completing a mean (satiety). Behavioral problems are common and can include temper tantrums, obsessive/compulsive behavior, and skin picking. PWS occurs due to abnormalities affecting certain genes in a specific region of chromosome 15. These abnormalities usually result from random (sporadic) errors in development, but are sometimes inherited. Introduction Originally described in the medical literature in 1956, PWS is the first disorder confirmed to be due to imprinting errors (see Causes section). The disorder was once known as hypogonadism, hypotonia, hypomentia, obesity (HHHO)."], [1195, "Wildervanck Syndrome", "The disorder is characterized by a skeletal condition known as Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS); abnormalities of certain eye (ocular) movements (i.e., Duane syndrome); and/or hearing impairment that is present at birth (congenital). In individuals with KFS, there is abnormal union or fusion of two or more bones of the spinal column (vertebrae) within the neck (cervical vertebrae). Duane syndrome is characterized by limitation or absence of certain horizontal eye movements; retraction or \"drawing back\" of the eyeball into the eye cavity (orbit) upon attempting to look inward; and, in some cases, abnormal deviation of one eye in relation to the other (strabismus)."], [1196, "Wiedmann-Beckwith Syndrome", "However, in many individuals, associated features include above-average birth and weight and increased growth after birth (postnatally), an usually large tongue (macroglossia), enlargement of certain internal organs (visceromegaly), and protrusion of a portion of the intestines and abdominal organs through a tear in the wall of the stomach or bellybutton (abdominal wall defects). BWS may also be associated with low blood sugar levels within the first few days or the first month of life (neonatal hypoglycemia), advanced bone age, particularly up to age four; distinctive grooves in the ear lobes and other facial abnormalities, abnormal enlargement of one side or structure of the body (hemihyperplasia) may occur, resulting in unequal (asymmetric) growth, and an increased risk of developing certain childhood cancers. In approximately 85 percent of cases, BWS results from genetic changes that appear to occur randomly (sporadically).

During bursts of violent coughing, you may make a noise that sounds like a \"whoop\" when you try to take a breath. Whooping cough spreads easily from one person to another. Getting the pertussis vaccine can help you avoid the disease, make it less severe, and prevent you from spreading it to those who are at risk for more serious problems. With good care, most people recover from whooping cough with no problems. The illness can be dangerous in older adults and young children, especially babies who aren't old enough to have had the pertussis vaccine. When someone with whooping cough coughs, sneezes, or laughs, tiny drops of fluid holding the bacteria are put into the air. After the bacteria infect someone, symptoms appear about 7 to 14 days later. Symptoms of whooping cough may occur in three stages, especially in young children. The cough goes from a mild, dry, hacking cough to a severe cough that you can't control. When you can take a breath of air, it may make a whooping noise. Coughing fits may flare up if you get a cold or have a similar illness. Adults and older children usually have milder symptoms than young children. Symptoms of whooping cough usually last 6 to 10 weeks, but they may last longer. To rule out other health problems, he or she may order tests such as a chest X-ray or blood tests. It can sometimes be hard to diagnose whooping cough, because you may seem healthy between coughing episodes. Your doctor may take a sample of mucus from your nose and have it tested for the bacteria that cause whooping cough. Also, if you start taking the antibiotics when you first get whooping cough, the disease may not last as long. Family members and other close contacts may be prescribed antibiotics before they have any symptoms. This allows the doctor to see how well the baby deals with and recovers from coughing spells. It also makes it easier for the baby to get extra oxygen and other care if needed. To avoid spreading the illness:1 Children with whooping cough need to take antibiotics for at least 5 days before going back to day care or school. If your child didn't take antibiotics, wait 21 days after the start of symptoms before sending your child to school or day care. Adults or teens with whooping cough need to take antibiotics for at least 5 days before being near young children or going to work at a school, a day care center, or a health facility. If your child has whooping cough: Create a quiet, calm, restful environment. Sometimes humidity makes coughing spells worse, in which case it should be avoided. Many of these same tips will help if you're an adult with whooping cough. Over-the-counter medicines, such as cough syrups and antihistamines, don't help with whooping cough. Making sure that you and your children are immunized against whooping cough is the best way to prevent it. Starting at age 2 months, children need a series of shots (called DTaP) to protect against whooping cough. A booster shot (called Tdap) is recommended at age 11 or 12 and for all teens and adults who never had a Tdap shot. Because whooping cough symptoms can be mild in adults, you may not know that you have the illness. Without a Tdap shot, if you have whooping cough, you can spread whooping cough to a young infant or another person who isn't protected and for whom the disease is much more dangerous.

Testicular cancer is highly curable, especially when it's diagnosed at an early stage. If the cancer isn't treated during its early stages, it may spread (metastasize) to the lymph nodes and to the lungs, liver, brain, and bones. Unless you are sure you won't want to father a child in the future, talk to your doctor about sperm banking before any treatment for testicular cancer. Treatment begins with surgery (orchiectomy) to remove the affected testicle. After surgery, depending on which type of cancer cells are present and whether your cancer has spread to other areas of your body (stage), you may need only surveillance. Most testicular cancers are either seminomas or nonseminomas. Seminomas are the kind of testicular cancer that grow and spread slowly. After surgery, treatments may include: Surveillance. For seminomas that are more advanced (stage II or stage III cancers), treatments begin with surgery (orchiectomy) and may include radiation, chemotherapy, or combination chemotherapy. After chemotherapy, tissue masses that remain may need to be removed with surgery. Nonseminomas are the kind of testicular cancer that grow and spread more quickly than seminomas. After surgery, treatments may include: Surveillance. For nonseminomas that are more advanced (stage II or stage III cancers), treatments begin with surgery (orchiectomy) and may include surgery to remove lymph nodes, chemotherapy, or combination chemotherapy. After chemotherapy, any tissue masses that remain will be removed with surgery, if possible. If your cancer was found early, you may have a choice about further treatment. This care may lead to early identification and management of cancer that comes back. Imaging tests, including X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. Stable or increasing tumor marker levels after treatment may mean that your cancer is still present or has returned. A diagnosis of testicular cancer means that you will be seeing your doctor regularly for years to come. Testicular cancer that has come back (recurred) may be found during a physical exam, through an imaging test, or as a result of increasing tumor marker levels. This is especially true if the cancer has spread only to the lymph nodes in the pelvis, belly, or lower back and pelvis. Recurrent testicular cancer may be treated with chemotherapy, surgery to remove lymph nodes, or radiation. Chemotherapy may be followed by surgery to remove any remaining cancer. You can have this care along with treatment to cure your illness. They may help you decide what treatment you want or don't want. For more information, see the topic Palliative Care. For some people who have advanced cancer, a time comes when treatment to cure the cancer no longer seems like a good choice. This can be because the side effects, time, and costs of treatment are greater than the promise of cure or relief. You and your doctor can decide when you may be ready for hospice care."], [1207, "Which treatment for stress incontinence ...", "Some people with urinary incontinence may get relief by making simple lifestyle changes. If you have stress incontinence, for instance, in which you leak urine when you cough, sneeze, or laugh, your doctor may tell you to limit how much you drink. If you have urge incontinence, in which you get the sudden urge to urinate and can't always make it to the bathroom in time, your doctor may tell you to avoid spicy foods, caffeine, and carbonated drinks, because they can irritate the bladder and make the problem worse. Exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, known as Kegels, can sometimes help people with stress incontinence. For urge incontinence, bladder training, sometimes called bladder retraining, can also help. This involves gradually increasing the interval time between trips to the bathroom, working up to longer and longer intervals between bathroom stops. For urge incontinence, medications known as anticholinergics/antimuscarinics (Detrol, Ditropan XL, Enablex, Oxytrol, Urispas, and Vesicare) can prevent bladder spasms. OAB is a condition in which the bladder squeezes too often or without warning, resulting in incontinence. Also, Botox injected into the bladder muscle causes the bladder to relax, increasing its storage capacity and reducing episodes of urinary incontinence. It can be used for adults who do not respond to or can't use the medications listed above. A pessary, a plastic device inserted into the vagina, may help prevent urine leakage by supporting the neck of the bladder; it is most useful for stress incontinence. If the above treatments don't provide enough relief, surgery may help. One procedure works by supporting the bladder so that it returns to its normal position. The nerves they stimulate control the pelvic floor area and the devices can manipulate contractions in the organs and muscles within the pelvic floor. This is especially true if your symptoms are causing you to avoid social events, withdraw from life, or feel depressed. For urinary incontinence treatment, start with your primary care doctor. If your primary care doctor is unable to help, ask for a referral to a specialist. Doctors who specialize in treating urinary incontinence include urogynecologists, gynecologists with extra training in urinary incontinence, or urologists, doctors who specialize in problems of the urinary tract system in men and women. The best outcome depends, of course, on getting the correct diagnosis and following your doctor's advice to help improve your condition."], [1208, "Which treatment for hemorrhoids is right...", "Hemorrhoids often get better without surgery or even procedures your doctor can do in the office. (If you're pregnant, you should talk to your doctor before you try any medicine or change your diet.) This helps reduce swelling in the area and relaxes your clenching sphincter muscle. Put a little petroleum jelly just inside your anus to make pooping hurt less. But don't use it for longer than a week unless your doctor says it's OK. Or try putting a simple cold pack on the tender area for a few minutes to numb it and bring down the swelling. It's the best thing for hemorrhoids: A diet rich in high-fiber foods and with few processed foods. Eat mostly vegetables, fruit, nuts, and whole grains to avoid constipation. If you can't get enough fiber from food, your doctor may want you to take a fiber supplement or stool softener. Drink seven to eight glasses of water each day, at least a half-gallon total. Even if your doctor prescribes medication or suggests surgery, you'll probably need to change your diet. If your symptoms are severe or aren't getting better after a couple of weeks, your doctor may want do a procedure to shrink or remove the hemorrhoids. Your doctor can inject an internal hemorrhoid with a solution to create a scar and close off the hemorrhoid. Using a special tool, the doctor puts a tiny rubber band around the hemorrhoid, which shuts off its blood supply almost instantly. Within a week, the hemorrhoid will dry up, shrink, and fall off. With an electric probe, a laser beam, or an infrared light, your doctor will make a tiny burn to remove tissue and painlessly seal the end of the hemorrhoid, causing it to close off and shrink. For large internal hemorrhoids or extremely uncomfortable external hemorrhoids, your doctor may want to do a traditional hemorrhoidectomy to remove them, or a newer technique using staples. Medical treatments are effective, but unless you change your diet and lifestyle, hemorrhoids may come back."], [1209, "Which test should I have to screen for c...", "The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has the following advice for colorectal cancer testing:1 People ages 50 to 75 should have a stool test (FIT or FOBT), sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy. People ages 76 to 85 should not be routinely screened for colorectal cancer. No recommendations are made about CT colonography (CTC, also called virtual colonoscopy) or the stool DNA test (sDNA). The American Cancer Society (ACS), the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, and the American College of Radiology recommend routine testing for people age 50 and older who have a normal risk for colon cancer. They also have recommendations for other tests, such as virtual colonoscopy (CTC) and the stool DNA test (sDNA).2 Talk with your doctor about which test is best for you. Experts agree that people with a higher risk, such as those who have a strong family history of colon cancer, may need to be tested sooner. Less common screening tests include the stool DNA test (sDNA) and computed tomographic colonography (CTC). Have a first-degree relative (parent, brother, sister, or child) with an adenomatous polyp or colorectal cancer. Have a rare inherited polyp syndrome, such as FAP or Lynch syndrome (HNPCC). It may be used as a test for people who do not have an increased risk for colon cancer or for people who cannot have a colonoscopy. For people who have an increased risk for colon cancer, regular colonoscopy may be better because it permits tissue biopsies or polyp removal."], [1210, "Which birth control method should I use?", "You have a lot of choices for birth control, from condoms to caps to pills. Find one that you're confident with -- and that you can commit to using every time you have sex. These include birth control pills, stick-on patches, insertable vaginal rings, shots, and implants. They use hormones, similar to the ones in your body, to stop the release of an egg so that it can't get fertilized by sperm. Most people don't use any method perfectly, all the time. With typical use, hormonal birth control is about 90% effective. But if used correctly all the time, it prevents pregnancy over 99% of the time. The implant is also about 99% effective. If you decide to take a birth control pill, ask your doctor how long you should use another form of birth control until the pill takes effect. As the name suggests, these create a barrier to keep sperm from reaching an egg. They're durable and may be more effective against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) than \"natural\" or \"lambskin\" condoms. With typical use, the male condom is about 80% effective. If used perfectly every time, it prevents pregnancy 98% of the time. It's between 68% and 84% effective. You can also use spermicides -- gels, creams, and foams -- with other birth control or on their own. Alone, they're about 70% effective. A few options -- like the diaphragm, cervical cap, and cervical shield -- are available only by prescription. They're rubber or silicone barriers that you place far up in your vagina. These are small, plastic devices that a doctor or nurse will insert into your uterus. The procedure is simple and quick, although a little uncomfortable. Once it's in position, the IUD will protect you from pregnancy for a long time. IUDs that use hormones are good for 3-5 years depending on which type you get. The copper-T version -- which uses copper, a natural sperm-killer -- is good for up to 10 years. IUDs are about 99% effective in preventing pregnancy. It's for use after unprotected sex or if your condom breaks. It can prevent pregnancy up to 3 to 5 days later, although the sooner you take it, the better. Most emergency contraception products are so-called \"morning after\" pills, but the copper-T IUD works as emergency contraception, too. Women who weigh 165 pounds or more and want emergency contraception should use the IUD, since research shows that the pills start to lose effectiveness for them. You'll want to do these things so your birth control works: 1. It needs to be easy for you to use. Condoms and other latex or plastic types of birth control can break down over time. Pills become less effective. Never use a condom that's been in a car's glove compartment for a while or crammed in a wallet. In the heat of the moment, you're not going to stop to read the instructions in the box. Don't risk tearing the condom by opening it with scissors or your teeth. A condom that's too small or big may not work. As you put it on, hold the tip to prevent an air bubble from forming. Don't use any that are oil-based, like baby oil or petroleum jelly. For better protection, use a lubricant with spermicide. Have emergency contraception on hand. If a condom breaks, you may want to use emergency birth control just in case."], [1211, "Wheezing", "Wheezing may also accompany respiratory infections such as acute bronchitis and may be experienced by patients in heart failure and by some with emphysema (or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD). You should be regularly monitored by a doctor if you have asthma, severe allergies, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or COPD. The whistling sound that characterizes wheezing occurs when air moves through airways that are narrowed, much like the way a whistle or flute makes music. In asthma, this airway narrowing is due to inflammation, mucus, and muscle spasms in the wall of the airways. Wheezing is usually the result of one of the following health problems: Asthma Allergic reactions to pollen, chemicals, pet dander, dust, foods, or insect stings Acute or chronic bronchitis and COPD, which can produce excess mucus in the respiratory tract and cause the lungs' passageways to become blocked Less commonly, wheezing may also be caused by these health problems: Cystic fibrosis Obstruction from a foreign body which has been inhaled (such as a coin) A tumor in the lungs Congestive heart failure (usually in older adults)"], [1212, "What type of dialysis should I have?", "They also ensure that you have the right amount of chemicals, like potassium and sodium (salt), in your blood. There are two types of dialysis: Hemodialysis: Your blood is put through a filter outside your body, cleaned, and then returned to you. Peritoneal dialysis: Your blood is cleaned inside your body. A special fluid is put into your abdomen to absorb waste from the blood that passes through small vessels in your abdominal cavity. When you should start dialysis depends on your age, energy level, overall health, and how willing you are to commit to a treatment plan. Although it can make you feel better and live longer, it involves a lot of your time. This can be done in a few ways: Fistula (also known as arteriovenous fistula or A-V fistula): An artery and vein are joined together under the skin in your arm. Most of the time, this is done in the one you don't write with. An A-V fistula needs only about 6 weeks to heal before it can be used for hemodialysis. Graft (arteriovenous graft or A-V graft): A plastic tube is used to join an artery and vein under your skin. This heals in only 2 weeks, so you can start hemodialysis faster. This won't last as long as a fistula. You'll likely need another graft after a few years. The risk of infection is greater with a graft. You'll also have to see your doctor more often so he can make sure the graft stays open. Catheter (central venous catheter): This method is an option if you need to start hemodialysis very quickly. A flexible tube (catheter) is put into a vein in your neck, below your collarbone, or next to your groin. A tech will place two needles in your arm where the fistula or graft is located. A pump in the hemodialysis machine slowly draws out your blood, then sends it through another machine called a dialyzer. This works like a kidney and filters out extra salt, waste, and fluid. Your cleaned blood is sent back into your body through the second needle in your arm. You can have hemodialysis in a hospital, a dialysis treatment center, or at home. If you have it in a center, the sessions last 3 to 5 hours, and you'll likely only need them three times a week. It uses the lining of your belly to filter your blood. A few weeks before you start treatment, a catheter is placed near your navel. You'll use the catheter to transfer dialysis solution from a bag into your belly. There are two kinds of PD: Continuous cycler peritoneal dialysis (CCPD): This uses a machine to do your exchanges. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD): You'll do your exchanges by hand. Your doctor can help you decide which type fits your lifestyle. You could also have nausea, vomiting, dry or itchy skin, muscle cramps, or feel very tired. You can lessen side effects by being careful about what you eat and drink. Your doctor can advise how much fluid, protein, and salt you should have. Try to stay away from things that can harm your kidneys, like alcohol, smoking, or illegal drugs. Try these tips to stay healthy: Check your access site daily for redness, pus, and swelling. Keep the bandage that covers your catheter clean and dry. This treatment should maintain or improve your quality of life. If you want to stop dialysis because you feel depressed or ashamed, your doctor may urge you to speak to a counselor first. Sharing your feelings, taking antidepressants, or doing both of these things may help you make a more informed decision."], [1213, "Wet Lung", "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a type of severe, acute lung dysfunction affecting all or most of both lungs that occurs as a result of illness or injury. Major symptoms may include breathing difficulties (dyspnea), rapid breathing (tachypnea), excessively deep and rapid breathing (hyperventilation) and insufficient levels of oxygen in the circulating blood (hypoxemia).

There are many different causes of West syndrome and if a specific cause can be identified, a diagnosis of symptomatic West syndrome can be made."], [1215, "West Nile Virus", "But in rare cases, West Nile leads to severe illness that affects the brain or spinal cord. People older than 50 are at the highest risk for serious problems from West Nile. Most people fully recover from West Nile. But some people who get a severe infection have permanent problems such as seizures, memory loss, and brain damage. Most often, mosquitoes spread the virus by biting birds infected with the virus and then biting people. Mosquitoes can also spread the virus to other animals, such as horses. But you can't get West Nile from these animals or from touching or kissing an infected person. West Nile can spread through an organ transplant or a blood transfusion. That rarely happens in the United States, though, because all donated blood is screened to see if the virus is present. Some evidence suggests that West Nile can spread from a mom to her baby during pregnancy, at birth, or through breast milk. Breastfeeding has many benefits, and the risk of spreading the virus to babies seems to be very low. About 80 out of 100 people who have West Nile have no symptoms.1 When symptoms do appear, they start 2 to 15 days after the mosquito bite. A rash, usually on the chest, and swollen glands (lymph nodes). Most people who have the mild form of West Nile have a fever for 5 days, have a headache for 10 days, and feel tired for more than a month. West Nile causes serious illness in about 1 out of 150 people who get infected.1 It can lead to swelling of the brain (encephalitis), the spinal cord (myelitis), or the tissues around the brain and spinal cord (meningitis). If you have a severe case of West Nile, symptoms can last for weeks or months, especially if the infection has spread to your brain. If your doctor thinks that you may have West Nile, he or she will ask questions to find out when you were bitten by a mosquito and what symptoms you have. The antibodies can show if you have had a recent West Nile infection. The antibodies don't always appear right away, so your doctor may test your blood again in a couple of weeks. You may also have other tests, such as: A spinal tap (lumbar puncture) to look for antibodies or other signs of the virus in the fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord. An MRI scan, which makes pictures of your brain. Be sure to drink enough fluids and get lots of rest. If you have severe West Nile, you may need to stay in a hospital so you can get treatment to help your body fight the illness. You may get fluids given through a vein (intravenous, or IV) and get help preventing other illnesses such as pneumonia. You can contact your local health department for the latest information on West Nile virus in your area. It's also a good idea to take steps to lower your risk of getting mosquito bites: Use insect repellent when you go outdoors in the late spring, summer, and early fall. Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants if you know that you will be in areas with lots of mosquitoes or where you know West Nile virus has been found. Stay indoors at dawn, at dusk, and in the early evening when mosquitoes are the most active.

Due to degenerative changes affecting the facial area, individuals with Werner Syndrome may have unusually prominent eyes, a beaked or pinched nose, and/or other characteristic facial abnormalities. Werner Syndrome may also be characterized by development of a distinctive high-pitched voice; eye abnormalities, including premature clouding of the lenses of the eyes (bilateral senile cataracts); and certain endocrine defects, such as impaired functioning of the ovaries in females or testes in males (hypogonadism) or abnormal production of the hormone insulin by the pancreas and resistance to the effects of insulin (non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus).

ITP presents as a brief, self-limiting form of the disorder (acute ITP) or a longer-term form (chronic ITP). Acute ITP accounts for about 50% of cases, and chronic ITP accounts for the remainder. Eighty percent (80%) of the children with ITP have the acute form while the chronic form affects mostly adults.

Motor neurons are nerve cells that transmit nerve impulses from the spinal cord or brain (central nervous system) to muscle or glandular tissue. Infants with SMA1 experience severe weakness before 6 months of age, and the patient never achieves the ability to sit independently when placed. Muscle weakness, lack of motor development and poor muscle tone are the major clinical manifestations of SMA1. Normally, the chest expands during inspiration as the intercostal muscles (the muscles between the ribs) expand during inspiration. Abdominal breathing occurs when the intercostal muscles are weak and the diaphragm muscle is responsible for inspiration. Movement of the diaphragm (the muscle between the chest and abdomen) expands causing the abdomen to move during the inspiration cycle. The different subtypes, SMA 0-4 are based on the age of onset of symptoms and the course and progression of the disease. SMA0 patients are extremely weak at birth, require immediate artificial ventilation and will never breathe independently. Werdnig-Hoffman disease, which is also known as spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (SMA1) or acute spinal muscular atrophy, refers to individuals who have symptom onset prior to 6 months of age. SMA 3 patients (Kugelberg-Welander disease) will show symptoms after age 1, and will walk for a period of time prior to loss of motor abilities.

One of the first signs in Stickler syndrome is nearsightedness (myopia), in which objects close by are seen clearly but objects that are far away appear blurry. Myopia may vary from mild to severe in Stickler syndrome, but generally is not progressive (does not get worse). Myopia may be detectable shortly after birth, but the onset varies and may not develop until adolescence or even adulthood in some cases. Stickler syndrome is characterized by the following clinical features: vitreoretinal degeneration, myopia, cataracts, retinal holes and detachments, sensorineural hearing loss, a characteristic facial appearance with mid facial flatness, small chin, long philtrum; palatal abnormalities, including cleft palate, bifid uvula or high arched palate; musculoskeletal problems including loose joints, scoliosis, chest deformities, Legg-Calve-Perthe's disease; early onset degenerative osteoarthritis (onset before age 40 years by xray); and mitral valve prolapse. Four distinct forms of Stickler syndrome have been identified in the medical literature based on location of the mutated gene and inheritance pattern and at least one other form exists with an as yet unknown mutation location. Stickler syndrome was first described in the medical literature in 1965 and 1965 by Gunnar Stickler et al., who called the disorder hereditary progressive arthro-ophthalmopathy. Connective tissue, which is the material between cells of the body that gives the tissue form and strength, is found all over the body.

The deleted chromosome 4 causes the features of Wolf-Hirschhorn, including facial features like wide-set eyes, a distinct bump on the forehead, a broad nose, and low-set ears. Doctors do think that three different genes can be deleted from chromosome 4, and all are important to early development. For example, one is linked to abnormalities of the face, while another seems to trigger the seizures that affect nearly all children with Wolf-Hirschhorn. Sometimes though, Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome is caused when one of the parents has something called a \"balanced translocation.\" That mean two or more of their chromosomes broke and switched spots during their development. But it raises the odds that person will have a child with a chromosomal disorder, including Wolf- Hirschhorn.

For example, you may learn that you're more likely to overeat while you're bored or stressed. Do something else to soothe your stress, for instance. Also, you might want to put treats away. It's mostly about time: 15 minutes, to be specific. You need at least that much time to feel full. So eat slower, giving your brain enough time to notice that you've eaten. Another trick is to use smaller plates so that small portions do not appear too small. Also, changing your eating schedule can help you reach your goal, especially if you tend to skip or delay meals and overeat later. A good reward is something that is desirable, timely, and depends on meeting your goal. Rewards may include treating yourself to a movie or massage, taking an afternoon off from work, or giving an hour of time to yourself.

Your baby will go through one or more of these weaning processes. All types of weaning usually work best when they are done gradually-over several weeks, months, or even longer. Weaning a baby from the breast is a big change for moms as well as for babies. Some moms feel a little sad to lose some of the closeness that breastfeeding provides. Don't be surprised if you feel both happy and sad that your child is becoming more independent. Signs that a baby is ready to wean often appear after the baby has learned to crawl or learned to walk. Your breastfeeding baby may suck a few times and then stop nursing. He or she may just start to lose interest in your breast. Bottle-fed babies who are ready to wean may start spitting out the nipple or throwing or hiding the bottle before it is empty. Your baby may show more interest in drinking from a cup. When to start weaning mostly depends on how ready you and your child are to start weaning. Other moms are ready to wean sooner or have responsibilities or life changes that make it necessary. There is no right or wrong time to start, and there's not a certain amount of time to take, except that it's best to wean your baby from a bottle by 18 months of age. Also, try not to start weaning when your child or your family is under stress. Stress can range from cutting a new tooth to moving to a new house or starting a new day care program. Gradual weaning is best for both babies and moms. This will help give you and your baby time to adjust to new ways of feeding. If you are breastfeeding, gradual weaning helps keep your breasts from becoming too full, a problem called breast engorgement. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the following:1 Breastfeed your baby for at least a year and as long after a year as you and your child desire. Feed your baby breast milk or iron-enriched formula until he or she is 12 months of age. Begin to introduce solid foods at about 6 months of age to complement the breast milk or formula. Do not feed your baby cow's milk before 12 months of age. You can also give your baby breast milk from a cup or a bottle. Sometimes a mother wants to stop breastfeeding but her baby seems to want to keep it up. Try offering your milk or formula in a cup or bottle before you breastfeed or between breastfeedings.

Amyloid deposits may occasionally occur in isolation without evidence of a systemic disease; isolated bladder or tracheal amyloid are the most common such presentations."], [1236, "Water on the Brain (Hydrocephalus)", "The brain and spinal cord are surrounded by a clear fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This fluid is produced and stored in cavities in the brain called ventricles. It circulates around the brain, moving from ventricle to ventricle. The purposes of the fluid are to cushion and protect the brain and spinal cord, to supply them with nutrients, and to remove some of their waste products. Hydrocephalus is a condition in which there is too much CSF in the ventricles. The ventricles enlarge to accommodate the extra fluid and then press on different parts of the brain, causing a number of different symptoms. Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a type of hydrocephalus that usually occurs in older adults. The average age of person with NPH is over age 60. The drainage of CSF is blocked gradually, and the excess fluid builds up slowly. The slow enlargement of the ventricles means that the fluid pressure in the brain may not be as high as in other types of hydrocephalus. However, the enlarged ventricles still press on the brain and can cause symptoms (the term \"normal pressure\" is somewhat misleading). The parts of the brain most often affected in NPH are those that control the legs, the bladder, and the \"cognitive\" mental processes such as memory, reasoning, problem solving, and speaking. This decline in mental processes, if it is severe enough to interfere with everyday activities, is known as dementia. Other symptoms include abnormal gait (difficulty walking), inability to hold urine (urinary incontinence), and, occasionally, inability to control the bowels. The walking problems are similar to those of Parkinson's disease. The good news is that, unlike Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, NPH can be reversed in many people with appropriate treatment. Normal pressure hydrocephalus can occur after a head injury, bleeding around the brain (due to a blow to the head), stroke, meningitis (infection of a protective layer of tissue around the brain), or brain tumor. At first, the symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus are usually very subtle. Symptoms of dementia include: Memory loss Speech problems Apathy (indifference) and withdrawal Changes in behavior or mood Difficulties with reasoning, paying attention, or judgment Walking problems Unsteadiness Leg weakness Sudden falls Shuffling steps Difficulty taking the first step, as if feet were stuck to the floor \"Getting stuck\" or \"freezing\" while walking Urinary symptoms Inability to hold urine Inability to hold stool, or feces (less common) Frequent urination Urgency to urinate The following symptoms can be related to increased pressure in the brain: Headache Nausea Difficulty focusing eyes Some people think that memory loss, difficulty finding words, walking problems, or urination problems are normal parts of aging. Any of these problems, or changes in mood or behavior, warrants a visit to your health care provider. The symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus can also occur in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, the combination of dementia-like symptoms, walking problems, and urinary problems should alert your health care provider to the possibility of NPH. At any point in this process, your health care provider may refer you to a specialist in brain disorders (neurologist or neurosurgeon) to complete the evaluation and begin treatment. The medical professional will ask you questions about your symptoms and when they started, your medical and mental problems now and in the past, your family's medical problems, medications you have taken now and in the past, your work and travel experiences, and your habits and lifestyle. This is followed by a detailed physical exam to document your condition and rule out other disorders that might cause similar symptoms. The exam will probably include tests of your mental status, such as answering questions and following simple directions. Neuropsychological testing is the most accurate method of pinpointing and documenting a person's cognitive problems and strengths. Imaging Tests CT scan of the head: This scan is similar to an X-ray but gives a more detailed, 3-dimensional picture of the brain. It cannot confirm a diagnosis of NPH, but it can show ventricular enlargement or other changes that suggest NPH. Newer techniques can actually measure the flow of CSF in the brain. MRI of the head : This scan uses radio signals and a strong magnet to create a detailed picture of the brain. It is safe and painless, like a CT scan, but takes longer (about 30 minutes). Cisternography: This test is much more involved than CT scan or MRI and is not widely used. Lumbar puncture (spinal tap): This procedure involves removal of CSF from the area around the spinal cord in the lower back. The CSF pressure is measured, and the fluid that is removed is analyzed for abnormalities that might give a clue as to the problem. Usually, more fluid is removed than is necessary for these tests, the idea being that removal of a large volume of CSF may help relieve symptoms (this is checked by comparing exam results before and after). If symptoms are relieved, it is usually temporary; improvement of symptoms with lumbar puncture is commonly interpreted as meaning that a surgical shunt would be helpful in that person. Normal pressure hydrocephalus generally cannot be cured. However, many people with the condition obtain substantial relief through surgical treatment. For those who are not candidates for surgery, treatment consists of measures to relieve mood and behavioral problems, cope with physical problems such as incontinence and walking difficulties, and maximize physical, mental, and social functioning. An individual with normal pressure hydrocephalus should always be under the care of a medical professional. Much of the day-to-day care, however, is handled by family and caregivers. Medical care should focus on optimizing the individual's health, safety, and quality of life while helping family members cope with the many challenges of caring for a loved one with dementia and other symptoms of NPH. The degree of care required by people with NPH varies considerably. Those who undergo successful shunt surgery may continue to live a normal or near-normal independent life. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is not caused by any structural abnormality, such as a brain tumor. The tube is routed under the skin from the head to another part of the body, usually the peritoneum (the lower belly). The shunt is equipped with a valve that opens to release fluid when the pressure builds up. Many surgeons perform a spinal tap before surgery to test whether the symptoms get better with removal of fluid. In some cases, the person is hospitalized for a few days while fluid is drained slowly through a small tube called a catheter. Such complications include infection of the shunt and blood clots around the brain. Your neurologist or neurosurgeon will discuss the pros and cons of this operation and whether it might work for you. In endoscopic third ventriculostomy, an endoscope (thin tube with a lighted camera on the end) is used to create a small hole in the floor of the ventricles. The hole provides another way for CSF to drain from the brain. A healthy lifestyle, including not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, and regular exercise, may help avoid conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and stroke that might contribute to NPH. Wearing a seatbelt and safety helmet when indicated can help avoid head injury, another cause of NPH. In general, the outlook depends on the cause of the hydrocephalus and whether you are a candidate for surgery. Coping with the symptoms of NPH can be difficult for both you and your family members. The condition affects every aspect of your life, including family relationships, work, financial status, social life, and physical and mental health.

In most cases, common warts appear on the fingers, near the fingernails, or on the hands. Certain types of HPV can also cause warts to appear in the genital area. Plantar warts: This type of wart usually appears as flesh-colored or light brown lumps that are flecked with small clotted blood vessels that appear as tiny black dots. Genital warts: Genital warts can appear in the pubic area, on the genitals, in or around the anus, and/or in the vagina. The warts may look similar to the small parts of a cauliflower or they may be very tiny and difficult to see. HPV infection is the most common sexually transmitted disease in North America and certain forms of the virus can cause cervical cancer. Flat warts: This type of wart is more common in teens and children than in adults. Flat warts are smoother, flatter, and smaller than other warts and they generally occur on the face. Flat warts also can appear on the legs, especially among females. HPV may spread by person-to-person contact or through direct contact with an object used by a person with the virus. The virus that causes warts also can spread to other places on the body of the person with warts. Treatments may include: Freezing: In this treatment, a doctor will use liquid nitrogen to freeze a wart. Cantharidin: This substance, an extract of a blister beetle and applied to the skin, forms a blister around the wart. Other medications: These include bleomycin, which is injected into a wart to kill a virus, and imiquimod (Aldara and Zyclara), an immunotherapy drug that stimulates your own immune system to fight off the wart virus. Although imiquimod is stated for genital warts, it is modestly effective on other types of warts. Minor surgery: When warts cannot be removed by other therapies, surgery may be used to cut away the wart. The base of the wart will be destroyed using an electric needle or by cryosurgery (deep freezing). You should never brush, comb, or shave areas where warts are present as this can cause the virus to spread.

But when something happens to tip that balance, a fungus called candida can grow out of control and cause a yeast infection. There are many reasons you could get a yeast infection, including: Hormones: Changes during pregnancy, breast-feeding or menopause (or if you're taking birth control pills) can change the balance in your vagina. Diabetes: If your diabetes is not well-controlled, the increase in sugar in the mucus membranes (moist linings) of your vagina can create a place for yeast to grow. Douches and vaginal sprays: The use of these products can change the balance in your vagina. A weakened immune system: If you are HIV-positive or have another immune system disorder, the yeast may also grow uncontrolled. Sex: Though a yeast infection is not considered a sexually transmitted infection, it can be passed from person to person through sexual contact. You may also experience any or all of the following: Burning, redness, and swelling of the vagina and the vulva (the outer part of the female genitals) Pain or burning when you pee Pain during sex A thick, white, odorless discharge, similar to cottage cheese If you think you have a yeast infection, see your doctor before treating yourself. The symptoms of yeast infections are similar to other, more serious conditions, including sexually transmitted infections and bacterial vaginosis (bacterial overgrowth in the vagina). If you don't have a yeast infection and use antifungal medication, it can make future yeast infections more difficult to treat. Over-the-counter antifungal creams, ointments or suppositories (with miconazole or clotrimazole) are the most common ways to treat yeast infections. Your doctor may also prescribe a single-dose pill with fluconazole (an antifungal medicine) for you to take. If you're pregnant, it's safe to use creams or suppositories, but not the fluconazole you take by mouth. If you have diabetes or a weakened immune system, you may get yeast infections over and over again. If you get yeast infections at least four times a year, your doctor may recommend that you take a weekly fluconazole pill for 6 months to fight them. Some studies have shown that eating probiotic yogurt or taking Lactobacillus acidophilussupplements may slow the growth of yeast in the vagina, lowering the risk for infections."], [1278, "Yaws", "Yaws is an infectious tropical disease caused by the spirochete (spiral shaped) bacterium known as Treponema pertenue.

The second stage (usually starting several weeks or months after the first) presents with a crispy, crunchy rash that may cover arms, legs, buttocks and/or face. If the bottoms of the feet are involved, walking is painful and the stage is known as \"crab yaws.\" Stage 3 yaws involves the long bones, joints, and/or skin."], [1279, "Zinsser-Cole-Engman Syndrome", "Dyskeratosis congenita is a rare genetic form of bone marrow failure, the inability of the marrow to produce sufficient blood cells. Dyskeratosis is Latin and means the irreversible degeneration of skin tissue, and congenita means inborn. First described in the medical literature in 1906, dyskeratosis congenita was originally thought to be a skin disease that also affects the nails and the mouth. Thus, for the last 40 years or so, the bone marrow failure syndrome dyskeratosis congenita was diagnosed when patients presented with the triad of abnormal skin, malformation (dystrophy) of the nails, and white, thickened patches on the mucous membranes of the mouth (oral leukoplakia). Additional findings in patients with dyskeratosis congenita may include short stature, eye and tooth abnormalities, thin and early graying of the hair, lung (pulmonary) disease, liver disease, gut abnormalities, bone thinning (osteoporosis), infertility, learning difficulties, and delays in reaching developmental milestones. Today, in addition to examining the skin, nails, and mouth for these classical changes, we also use other tests to diagnose dyskeratosis congenita including testing for the genetic abnormality responsible for the development of the disease. Using these more sensitive tests, we are beginning to realize, that only a minority of patients with the genetic abnormality actually develop the full clinical picture of dyskeratosis congenita as outlined above. Whether the disease in these patients in the absence of skin manifestations should also be labeled with dyskeratosis congenita is controversial and often these individuals are referred to as having atypical dyskeratosis congenita. This new knowledge is important for physicians and patients because much of what has previously been published about this disease may actually not apply anymore for all individuals newly diagnosed with dyskeratosis congenita. These severe forms manifest early in life and are associated with additional clinical features that are usually not present in other forms of dyskeratosis congenita (see also below). The pattern of inheritance may be X-linked (Zinsser-Cole-Engleman syndrome), autosomal dominant (dyskeratosis congenita, Scoggins type) or autosomal recessive. However, in a large proportion of patients dyskeratosis congenita occurs sporadically, meaning that the parents do not show disease.

In response to too much estrogen (a female hormone) or too little testosterone (a male hormone), the glandular tissue of the breast swells and forms a breast bud (enlarged breast). In newborns, gynecomastia is caused by estrogen from the mother. Breast buds tend to go away gradually by 6 months of age, but they can last longer in some babies. In preteen boys, gynecomastia can also be caused by an estrogen-producing tumor. In teen boys, gynecomastia is caused by the hormonal changes of puberty. In adult males, gynecomastia is usually caused by another condition, such as liver or lung cancer, cirrhosis of the liver, overactive thyroid, or by hormone problems, such as cancer of the pituitary gland, adrenal glands, or testicles. Alcohol, marijuana, methamphetamine, and heroin use also may cause gynecomastia. Use of certain medicines may also cause gynecomastia, including: Steroids, such as prednisone or dexamethasone. Chemotherapy drugs, especially alkylating agents, a family of anticancer drugs that interfere with cell DNA and inhibit cancer cell growth. Antianxiety and antidepressant medicines (such as diazepam [Valium] and tricyclic antidepressants). In addition to having enlarged breasts, men or boys with gynecomastia may notice their breasts feel rubbery or firm. Boys may have a breast bud on one or both sides about the size of a nickel or quarter. Gynecomastia can usually be diagnosed from a physical exam and medical history. But if the breast lump is unusually large, one-sided, tender, or hard and fixed, a biopsy may be done to rule out other problems.

Place the cloth over your index finger, dip it in the mix, and use it to clean your eyelid. Rub the washcloth over your eyelashes and the edge of your lids for about 30 seconds to loosen clogged oils. Apply light pressure to squeeze out clogged oils from the glands behind your lashes. If the blepharitis results from a problem with your oil glands, the doctor may suggest a testosterone cream to put on your eyelids. He may also suggest LipiFlow, a 12-minute procedure that gently heats clogged glands and applies mild pressure to \"milk out\" the oils.

The bursa is a sac filled with lubricating fluid, located between tissues such as bone, muscle, tendons, and skin, that decreases rubbing, friction, and irritation. Bursitis is most often caused by repetitive, minor impact on the area, or from a sudden, more serious injury. Overuse or injury to the joint at work or play can also increase a person's risk of bursitis. An abnormal or poorly placed bone or joint (such as length differences in your legs or arthritis in a joint) can put added stress on a bursa sac, causing bursitis. Bursitis is more common in adults, especially in those over 40 years of age. The pain may build up gradually or be sudden and severe, especially if calcium deposits are present. Severe loss of motion in the shoulder -- called \"adhesive capsulitis\" or frozen shoulder -- can also result from the immobility and pain associated with shoulder bursitis. If you are planning to start exercising, you will be less likely to get bursitis if you gradually build up force and repetitions. Bursitis can be treated in a number of ways, including: Avoiding activities that aggravate the problem Resting the injured area Icing the area the day of the injury Taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicines If the condition does not improve in a week, see your doctor. However, multiple injections in a several month period are usually avoided due to potential side effects from the injections and the possibility of masking problems that need to be treated differently. This includes range-of-motion exercises and splinting (thumb, forearm, or bands). Surgery, although rarely needed, may be an option when bursitis does not respond to the other treatment options.

According to ayurveda, the five elements of nature (space, air, fire, water, earth) combine in the body as three components (doshas) known as Vatta, Pitta, and Kapha. These doshas relate closely to the basic elements of nature and to specific functions of the body. Vatta controls muscle and joint movement, breathing, and heartbeat. Also, Vatta controls anxiety, fear, pain, and other functions of the nervous system. Fire and water represent Pitta, which is thought to control such bodily functions as digestion, metabolism, intelligence, and skin color. Pitta governs the emotions of anger, hate, and jealousy. Emotional responses thought to be controlled by Kapha include calmness, forgiveness, love, and greed. The doshas, which are determined at the time of conception, also relate to an individual's physical makeup and personality. Most people are considered to have a combination of doshas, with one type usually being predominant. In ayurvedic medicine, it is thought that if an imbalance occurs in any of the three doshas, illness results. Ayurvedic medicine treats illness in many ways, including dietary changes, herbal remedies, and exercise. According to the ayurvedic philosophy, you can also use yoga, meditation, or counseling to treat disease. People use ayurvedic practices to maintain health, reduce stress, and improve flexibility, strength, and stamina. Researchers have found that yoga and meditation can be effective ways to treat diseases such as asthma, high blood pressure, and arthritis.

The cysts keep your kidneys from working like they should. That can cause health problems like high blood pressure, infections, and kidney stones. It can also cause kidney failure, although that doesn't happen to everyone. You can have ADPKD and not know it for many years. It's often called \"adult PKD,\" because the symptoms don't usually appear until people reach ages 30 to 40. But over time, ADPKD can start to damage your kidneys. You can slow the damage and prevent some of the complications by making healthy habits -- especially those that help you lower and then maintain your blood pressure -- part of your life. Depending on the type of ADPKD you have, you can lead an active life for many years by managing your symptoms and working with your doctor. ADPKD is caused by a problem with one of two genes in your DNA -- PKD1 or PKD2. A problem with either gene causes kidney cells to grow out of control and form cysts. Many genetic diseases happen when a person gets broken genes from both parents, but with ADPKD you need only one faulty gene to have the disease. That's why this kind of PKD is called \"autosomal dominant,\" meaning only one parent has to pass on a broken gene. If one parent has the disease, each child has a 50-50 chance of getting it. You can get ADPKD even if neither of your parents had the disease. This happens when one of your PKD genes gets a defect on its own. Most people with the disease have high blood pressure. Other signs that you have ADPKD include: Pain in your back or sides, often because of a burst cyst, a kidney stone, or a urinary tract infection Blood in your pee Swelling in your belly as the cysts grow Over time, cysts may grow big enough to damage your kidneys, and for some people, can cause them to fail. If that happens, you may have: Fatigue The need to pee often Irregular periods Nausea Shortness of breath Swollen ankles, hands, and feet Erectile dysfunction If your doctor thinks there's a problem with your kidneys, she may want you see a nephrologist, a specialist who treats kidney diseases. The doctor will do some tests to get images of your kidneys and check them for cysts. He may start with an ultrasound, which uses sound waves to make a picture of the inside of your body. To look for cysts that are too small for an ultrasound to find, he could also use: MRI. Doctors can also test your DNA to see if you have a broken PKD1 or PKD2 gene. It can show if you have the gene, but it can't tell you when you'll get ADPKD or how severe it will be. There is no cure for ADPKD, but you can treat the health problems that the disease causes and possibly prevent kidney failure. You may need: Medicines to lower your blood pressure Antibiotics to treat urinary tract infections Pain medicines If your kidneys fail, you'll need dialysis, which uses a machine to filter your blood and remove waste, like salt, extra water, and certain chemicals. You can also get on a waiting list or receive a kidney from a living donor for a kidney transplant. Ask your doctor if that's a good option for you. It's important to stay as healthy as possible to protect your kidneys and keep them working as long as you can. You can also keep up these habits to stay well: Eat right. Stick to a healthy, well-balanced diet that's low in fat and calories. Try to limit salt, because it can raise your blood pressure. Exercise can help control your weight and blood pressure. Smoking damages the blood vessels in the kidneys, and it may create more cysts. They can grow even slower when you control your blood pressure and make healthy lifestyle choices. As time goes on, some people get kidney failure and need dialysis or a kidney transplant. How quickly the disease gets worse may depend on which of your two PKD genes is broken. People with a defect in the PKD1 gene tend to get kidney failure before those with a problem in PKD2. ADPKD can also raise your risk for other health problems, such as: A bulge in a blood vessel of the brain, called an aneurysm Cysts on the liver and pancreas Diverticulosis Hernias Heart valve diseases such as mitral valve prolapse and aortic regurgitation For more information on ADPKD, visit the web site of the PKD Foundation."], [1304, "Autogenic Training", "Autogenic training (AT) is a technique that teaches your body to respond to your verbal commands. These commands \"tell\" your body to relax and control breathing, blood pressure, heartbeat, and body temperature. After you learn the technique, you can use it whenever you need or want relief from symptoms of stress, or you can practice it regularly to enjoy the benefits of deep relaxation and prevent the effects of chronic stress. Autogenic training consists of six standard exercises that make the body feel warm, heavy, and relaxed. For each exercise, you get into a simple posture (sitting in a comfortable chair or reclining), concentrate without any goal, and then use visual imagination and verbal cues to relax your body in some specific way. You learn each exercise by reading about it or watching a teacher, then practicing it for a few minutes several times a day. Learning the exercises, either from an instructor or on your own, usually moves at a slow, steady pace, taking 4 to 6 months to master all six exercises. For this reason, only those people who are motivated and committed to learning it are likely to get any benefit from AT. The exercises allow communication between the mind and the body, allowing you to influence body reactions that cannot normally be controlled, such as blood pressure, heartbeat, and body temperature. Some people use it to manage pain, reduce sleeping disorders such as insomnia, and increase their resistance to stress. Also, AT has been shown to help treat: Hyperventilation (breathing that is deeper and more rapid than normal). Asthma (inflammation in the tubes that carry air to the lungs, resulting in periodic episodes of difficulty breathing as well as wheezing, chest tightness, and coughing). Ulcers (sores on the skin or on a mucous membrane, such as inside the mouth, stomach, or intestines). Before beginning a program to learn AT, see your doctor for a physical exam and discuss what physiological effects AT might have on you. If you have a serious disease such as diabetes or a heart condition, learn and use AT only under the supervision of your doctor. Some people have a sharp increase or decrease in their blood pressure when they do AT exercises. If you have high or low blood pressure, have your doctor or nurse check to see whether AT is bringing your blood pressure closer to normal. If you use AT to help control any disease, including all heart and circulatory problems, do not use it to replace any conventional treatments, such as medicines.

The disease is recognized by various symptoms in different organs of the body that may or may not appear at the same time. Reactive arthritis primarily affects sexually active males between the ages of 20 and 40. The cause of reactive arthritis is still unknown, but research suggests the disease is caused, in part, by a genetic predisposition: Approximately 75% of those with the condition have a positive blood test for the genetic marker HLA-B27. In sexually active males, most cases of reactive arthritis follow infection with Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum, both sexually transmitted diseases. In other cases, people develop the symptoms following an intestinal infection with shigella, salmonella, yersinia, or campylobacter bacteria. The first symptoms of reactive arthritis are painful urination and a discharge from the penis if there is inflammation of the urethra. This is then followed by arthritis four to 28 days later that usually affects the fingers, toes, ankles, hips, and knee joints. Other symptoms include: Mouth ulcers Inflammation of the eye Keratoderma blennorrhagica (patches of scaly skin on the palms, soles, trunk, or scalp) Back pain from sacroiliac (SI) joint involvement Pain from inflammation of the ligaments and tendons at the sites of their insertion into the bone (enthesitis) Diagnosis of reactive arthritis can be complicated by the fact that symptoms often occur several weeks apart. A doctor may diagnose reactive arthritis when the patient's arthritis occurs together with or shortly following inflammation of the eye and the urinary tract and lasts a month or longer. Blood tests of reactive arthritis patients are typically positive for the HLA-B27 genetic marker, with an elevated white blood cell count and an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) -- both signs of inflammation. On an X-ray, joints that have been repeatedly inflamed may show areas of bone loss, signs of osteoporosis, or bony spurs. Joints in the back and pelvis (sacroiliac joints) may show abnormalities and damage from reactive arthritis. Joint inflammation from reactive arthritis is usually treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as naproxen, aspirin, or ibuprofen. Some people develop complications that may include inflammation of the heart muscle, inflammation with stiffening of the spine, glaucoma, progressive blindness, feet abnormalities, or accumulation of fluid in the lungs."], [1306, "Arthritic Rheumatoid Disease", "Polymyalgia rheumatica is a rare inflammatory disease characterized by muscle pain (myalgia), stiffness, and additional generalized systemic symptoms such as fatigue, low-grade fever, and/or a general feeling of ill health (malaise). Polymyalgia rheumatica can be a relatively benign condition that is extremely responsive to treatment. In some rare cases, permanent muscle weakness, degeneration and loss (atrophy) of muscle mass, and disability may occur. The exact cause of polymyalgia rheumatica is unknown, although immunological factors and familial tendencies (genetic predisposition) have been mentioned in the medical literature. Polymyalgia rheumatica is closely related to giant cell arteritis, another inflammatory disorder."], [1307, "Arteriovenous Malformation", "Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a vascular lesion that is a tangle of vessels of varying sizes in which there is one or more direct connections between the arterial and venous circulations. Brain AVMs are often presumed to be congenital, but there is no direct evidence that they form in utero. Although a small number of AVMs manifest themselves at or shortly after birth, most of them present later in life, and just as likely, form and progress during the later years of life. These high flow rates can lower the pressure in the arteries leading to the AVM and to surrounding relatively normal brain tissue. AVM can occur in many different parts of the body, but those located in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) can cause problems that affect the brain like other forms of stroke."], [1308, "Arrhythmia", "\"Arrhythmia\" means your heartbeat is irregular. It may feel like your heart skipped a beat, added a beat, is \"fluttering,\" or is beating too fast (which doctors call tachycardia) or too slow (called bradycardia). Or, you might not notice anything, since some arrhythmias are \"silent.\" Arrhythmias can be an emergency, or they may be harmless. If you feel something unusual happening with your heartbeat, call 911 so doctors can find out why it's happening and what you need to do about it. You could have an arrhythmia even if your heart is healthy. Or it could happen because you have: Heart disease The wrong balance of electrolytes (such as sodium or potassium) in your blood Changes in your heart muscle Injury from a heart attack Healing process after heart surgery The many types of arrhythmias include: Premature atrial contractions. These are early extra beats that start in the heart's upper chambers, called the atria. They're the \"skipped heartbeat\" we all occasionally feel. If you have a lot of PVCs, or symptoms linked to them, see a heart doctor (cardiologist). This common irregular heart rhythm causes the upper chambers of the heart to contract abnormally. A rapid heart rate, usually with a regular rhythm, starting from above the heart's lower chambers, or ventricles. You can get a rapid heart rate because there is an extra pathway between the heart's upper and lower chambers. When that happens in your heart, it can cause a fast heart rhythm, which doctors call tachycardia. The impulses that control your heart rhythm travel around the heart very quickly, making it beat unusually fast. It's caused by there being an extra pathway through a part of the heart called the AV node. It can cause heart palpitations, fainting, or heart failure. Because the heart is beating too fast, it can't fill up with enough blood. This can be a serious arrhythmia -- especially in people with heart disease -- and it may be linked to other symptoms. This may cause potentially dangerous arrhythmias and sudden death. These are slow heart rhythms, which may be due to disease in the heart's electrical system. When this occurs, you may feel like you are going to pass out, or actually pass out. There is a delay or a complete block of the electrical impulse as it travels from the heart's sinus node to its lower chambers. The heart may beat irregularly and, often, more slowly. An arrhythmia can be silent, meaning you don't notice any symptoms. A doctor can find an irregular heartbeat during a physical exam by taking your pulse or through an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). If you do have symptoms, they may include: Palpitations (a feeling of skipped heart beats, fluttering or \"flip-flops\") Pounding in your chest Dizziness or feeling light-headed Fainting Shortness of breath Chest pain or tightness Weakness or fatigue (feeling very tired) To diagnose an arrhythmia or find its cause, doctors use tests including: Electrocardiogram -- Also called an EKG or ECG, this test records the electrical activity of your heart. You wear small electrode patches on your chest, arms, and legs for the quick, painless test, which you take in your doctor's office. Holter monitor -- This is a portable EKG that you'll use for 1 to 2 days. Event monitor -- If your symptoms don't happen often, your doctor may suggest you wear one of these, usually for about a month. This is a device that, when you push a button, will record and store your heart's electrical activity for a few minutes. Each time you notice symptoms, you should try to get a reading on the monitor. The goal is to check how much stress your heart can manage before having a heart rhythm problem or not getting enough blood flow to the heart. For the most common type of stress test, you'll walk on a treadmill or pedal a stationary bike at increasing levels of difficulty while you're getting an EKG and getting your heart rate and blood pressure monitored. Echocardiogram -- This test uses ultrasound to evaluate heart muscle and heart valves. Cardiac catheterization -- Your doctor will insert a long, thin tube, called a catheter, into a blood vessel in your arm or leg. Then she'll inject dye through the catheter to help make X-ray videos of your heart's valves, coronary arteries, and chambers. Electrophysiology study -- This test records your heart's electrical activities and pathways. It can help find out what's causing heart rhythm problems and find the best treatment for you. During the test, your doctor will safely reproduce your abnormal heart rhythm and then may give you different medications to see which controls it best, or to see what procedure or device you need to treat it. Head-up tilt table test -- Doctors use this test to find out what's causing fainting spells. It measures the difference in heart rate and blood pressure when you're standing up or lying down. You'll lie on a stretcher, tilted at different angles while you're getting an EKG and specialists are checking your blood pressure and oxygen level. This shows if symptoms of passing out are due to the electrical system, the nervous system, or the vascular system. If drugs can't control a persistent irregular heart rhythm (such as atrial fibrillation), you might need cardioversion. For this, doctors, give you a short-acting anesthesia, then deliver an electrical shock to your chest wall to allow the normal rhythm to restart. This device sends small electrical impulses to the heart muscle to keep a safe heart rate. The pacemaker has a pulse generator (which houses the battery and a tiny computer) and wires that send impulses from the pulse generator to the heart muscle. When it detects a very fast, abnormal heart rhythm, it delivers an electric shock to the heart muscle to cause the heart to beat in a normal rhythm again. When the heart beats too fast, you get a series of small electrical impulses to the heart muscle to restore a normal heart rate and rhythm. You may get a low-energy shock at the same time as the heart beats to restore normal heart rhythm. When the heart is beating dangerously fast or irregularly, the heart muscle gets a higher-energy shock to restore a normal rhythm. You can think of this procedure as rewiring to fix an electrical problem within the heart. The catheter delivers high-frequency electrical energy to a small area inside the heart that causes the abnormal heart rhythm. This energy \"disconnects\" the pathway of the abnormal rhythm. During this procedure, the surgeon makes a series, or \"maze,\" of cuts in the heart's upper chambers."], [1309, "Aromatherapy (Essential Oils Therapy)", "Aromatherapy, or essential oils therapy, is using a plant's aroma-producing oils (essential oils) to treat disease. Aromatherapy as used today originated in Europe and has been practiced there since the early 1900s. Depending on the type of oil, the result on the body may be calming or stimulating. The oils are thought to interact with the body's hormones and enzymes to cause changes in blood pressure, pulse, and other body functions. Another theory suggests that the fragrance of certain oils may stimulate the body to produce pain-fighting substances. It has also been used to help treat a wide range of physical and mental conditions, including burns, infections, depression, insomnia, and high blood pressure. A wide range of licensed health professionals (such as massage therapists, nurses, and counselors) may have experience and training in aromatherapy. It is important to talk with your medical doctor to see whether aromatherapy may be helpful and safe for your specific health condition. Children younger than age 5 should not use aromatherapy, because they can be very sensitive to the oil. Nor should anyone use oils near the eyes or mouth, because irritation of the skin and membranes may occur. People with certain chronic illnesses or conditions should not use aromatherapy without first consulting a doctor. These illnesses and conditions include: Lung conditions such as asthma, respiratory allergies, or chronic lung disease. Some oils may cause skin irritation, especially in the membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth. Some oils (such as juniper, rosemary, and sage) may cause uterine contractions. It may not be safe to forgo your conventional medical treatment and rely only on an alternative therapy."], [1310, "Arnold-Chiari Malformation", "Summary Chiari malformations are a group of complex brain abnormalities that affect the area in lower posterior skull where the brain and spinal cord connect. The underlying anatomy of Chiari malformations is thought to be present at birth (congenital), although in many cases they may not become clinically apparent until adulthood. The exact cause of Chiari malformations are not known, but often the cavity near the base of the skull (posterior fossa) is narrow and abnormally small in relation to the size of the cerebellum, which this portion of the skull encloses. Researchers believe that in some cases the small posterior fossa may cause the developing brain, specifically the cerebellum and the brainstem, to be pushed downward. Part of the cerebellum (known as the cerebellar tonsils) may protrude (herniate) through the foramen magnum, which is the normal opening found in the occipital bone at the base of the skull. The tonsils may thus interfere with the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to and from the skull and spinal canal, potentially leading to accumulation of cerebral spinal fluid in the subarachnoid spaces of the brain and spine. A Chiari malformation can also cause pressure on the brain and produce hydrocephalus (pressure due to excessive cerebrospinal fluid accumulation in the brain) and the spinal cord, potentially causing a wide variety of symptoms. In some cases, affected individuals may not develop any symptoms (asymptomatic); in others, severe, potentially debilitating or life-threatening symptoms can develop. A diagnosis of a Chiari malformation usually signifies that the cerebellar tonsils protrude below the foramen magnum (often cited as at least 5 millimeters, though this is controversial). However, researchers have determined that the length of tonsil descent in a Chiari malformation does not always correspond to the severity of symptoms or to the response to treatment. These individuals still have symptoms associated with a Chiari malformation, most likely due to abnormalities in the flow of cerebrospinal fluid within the skull and spinal canal."], [1311, "Arachnoiditis", "Arachnoiditis is a pain disorder caused by the inflammation of the arachnoid, one of the membranes that surrounds and protects the nerves of the spinal cord. Arachnoiditis has no consistent pattern of symptoms, but in many people it affects the nerves connecting to the lower back and legs. The most common symptom is pain, but arachnoiditis can also cause: Tingling, numbness, or weakness in the legs Sensations that may feel like insects crawling on the skin or water trickling down the leg Severe shooting pain that can be similar to an electric shock sensation Muscle cramps, spasms and uncontrollable twitching Bladder, bowel and sexual problems As the disease progresses, symptoms may become more severe or even permanent. Many people with arachnoiditis are unable to work and suffer significant disability because they are in constant pain. Inflammation of the arachnoid can lead to the formation of scar tissue and can cause the spinal nerves to stick together and malfunction. The arachnoid can become inflamed because of an irritation from one of the following sources: Direct injury to the spine. Also, there is concern that the preservatives found in epidural steroid injections may cause arachnoiditis. Infection from bacteria or viruses: Infections such as viral and fungal meningitis or tuberculosis can affect the spine. Diagnosing arachnoiditis can be difficult, but tests such as the CAT scan (computerized axial tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) have helped with diagnosis. A test called an electromyogram (EMG) can assess the severity of the ongoing damage to affected nerve roots by using electrical impulses to check nerve function. Note: Myelograms with the radiographic contrast currently in use, combined with CAT scanning, are not considered to be responsible for causing arachnoiditis or causing it to worsen."], [1312, "Appendicitis", "Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix, a 3 1/2-inch-long tube of tissue that extends from the large intestine. One study suggests that the appendix may have some role in gut immunity, but nothing is definite. Appendicitis is a medical emergency that almost always requires prompt surgery to remove the appendix. This can lead to peritonitis, a serious inflammation of the abdominal cavity's lining (the peritoneum) that can be fatal unless it is treated quickly with strong antibiotics. In the U.S., one in 20 people will get appendicitis. Although it can strike at any age, appendicitis is rare under age 2 and most common between ages 10 and 30. Blockage may also occur from infection, since the appendix can swell in response to any infection in the body. The classic symptoms of appendicitis include: Dull pain near the navel or the upper abdomen that becomes sharp as it moves to the lower right abdomen. Loss of appetite Nausea and/or vomiting soon after abdominal pain begins Abdominal swelling Fever of 99-102 degrees Fahrenheit Inability to pass gas Almost half the time, other symptoms of appendicitis appear, including: Dull or sharp pain anywhere in the upper or lower abdomen, back, or rectum Painful urination and difficulty passing urine Vomiting that precedes the abdominal pain Severe cramps Constipation or diarrhea with gas If you have any of the mentioned symptoms, seek medical attention immediately, because timely diagnosis and treatment is very important. Do not eat, drink, or use any pain remedies, antacids, laxatives, or heating pads, which can cause an inflamed appendix to rupture. Symptoms of appendicitis are frequently vague or extremely similar to other ailments, including gallbladder problems, bladder or urinary tract infection, Crohn's disease, gastritis, intestinal infection, and ovary problems. The following tests are usually used to help make the diagnosis: Abdominal exam to detect inflammation Urine test to rule out a urinary tract infection Rectal exam Blood test to see if your body is fighting infection CT scans and/or ultrasound How Is Appendicitis Treated? Surgery to remove the appendix, which is called an appendectomy, is the standard treatment for almost all cases of appendicitis. Generally, if appendicitis is suspected, doctors tend to err on the side of safety and quickly remove the appendix to avoid its rupture. If the appendix has formed an abscess, you may have two procedures: one to drain the abscess of pus and fluid, and a later one to remove the appendix. However, there is some research showing that treatment of acute appendicitis with antibiotics may eliminate the need for surgery in certain cases. General anesthesia is usually given, and the appendix is removed through a 4-inch incision or by laparoscopy. If surgery is done with a laparoscope (a thin telescope-like instrument for viewing inside the abdomen), the incision is smaller and recovery is faster. After an appendectomy, call your doctor if you have: Uncontrolled vomiting Increased pain in your abdomen Dizziness/feelings of faintness Blood in your vomit or urine Increased pain and redness in your incision Fever Pus in the wound Can Appendicitis Be Prevented?"], [1313, "APECED Syndrome", "A condition is said to be \"autoimmune\" when antibodies and immune cells are launched by the body against one or several antigens of its own tissues.

Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes a red, scaly rash, most commonly over the elbows, knees, ankles, feet, hands, and other areas. It is important to know which type of psoriatic arthritis you have and to understand the characteristics so that it may be treated properly. Symmetric psoriatic arthritis: Symmetric arthritis affects the same joints -- usually in multiple matching pairs -- on opposite sides of the body. Asymmetric psoriatic arthritis: Asymmetric arthritis typically involves one to three joints in the body -- large or small -- such as the knee, hip, or one or several fingers. DIP psoriatic arthritis is sometimes confused with osteoarthritis, a chronic disease that causes the deterioration of joint cartilage and bone as well as bone spurs at the joints. Arthritis mutilans: Arthritis mutilans is a severe, deforming, and destructive form of psoriatic arthritis that primarily affects the small joints in the fingers and toes closest to the nail. Affecting men and women equally, about 10% to 30% of people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis may develop at any age, but usually affects people between the ages of 30 and 50. While the cause is not known, genetic factors, along with the immune system, likely play a role in determining who will develop the disorder. As many as 40% of people with psoriatic arthritis have a family history of skin or joint disease. Having a parent with psoriasis triples the chance of getting psoriasis yourself and thus increases the chance of developing psoriatic arthritis. Certain factors may trigger psoriasis, including the following: Injury to the skin: Injury to the skin has been associated with plaque psoriasis. For example, a skin infection, skin inflammation, or even excessive scratching can trigger psoriasis. However, a small minority find that strong sunlight aggravates their symptoms. Streptococcal infections: Some evidence suggests that streptococcal infections may cause a type of plaque psoriasis. These bacterial infections have been shown to cause guttate psoriasis, a type of psoriasis that looks like small red drops on the skin. Some examples are as follows: Lithium: Drug used to treat bipolar disorderBeta-blockers: Drugs used to treat high blood pressureAntimalarials: Drugs used to treat malaria Lithium: Drug used to treat bipolar disorder Beta-blockers: Drugs used to treat high blood pressure Antimalarials: Drugs used to treat malaria Emotional stress: Many people see a worsening of their psoriasis when emotional stress is increased. Alcohol: Alcohol is considered a risk factor for psoriasis, particularly in young to middle-aged men. Hormone changes: The severity of psoriasis may fluctuate with hormonal changes. A pregnant woman's symptoms are more likely to improve than worsen during pregnancy, if any changes occur at all. If there is little improvement or if there are permanent changes visible on an X-ray, then a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) or a biologic drug will be added to help prevent long-term joint damage. But use of biologic agents have made remission a real possibility."], [1317, "Asthma Asthma Symptoms", "People with asthma experience symptoms when the airways tighten, inflame, or fill with mucus. Common asthma symptoms include: Coughing, especially at night Wheezing Shortness of breath Chest tightness, pain, or pressure Still, not every person with asthma has the same symptoms in the same way. Your asthma symptoms may also vary from one asthma attack to the next, being mild during one and severe during another. Some people with asthma may go for extended periods without having any symptoms, interrupted by periodic worsening of their symptoms called asthma attacks. In addition, some people may only have asthma during exercise, or asthma with viral infections like colds. Early warning signs are changes that happen just before or at the very beginning of an asthma attack. These signs may start before the well-known symptoms of asthma and are the earliest signs that your asthma is worsening. But by recognizing these signs, you can stop an asthma attack or prevent one from getting worse. Early warning signs of asthma include: Frequent cough, especially at night Losing your breath easily or shortness of breath Feeling very tired or weak when exercising Wheezing or coughing after exercise Feeling tired, easily upset, grouchy, or moody Decreases or changes in lung function as measured on a peak flow meter Signs of a cold or allergies (sneezing, runny nose, cough, nasal congestion, sore throat, and headache) Trouble sleeping If you have early warning signs or symptoms of asthma, you should take more asthma medication as described in your asthma action plan. During the attack, the lining of the airways becomes swollen or inflamed and the cells lining the airways produce more and thicker mucus than normal. All of these factors -- bronchospasm, inflammation, and mucus production -- cause symptoms such as difficulty breathing, wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and difficulty performing normal daily activities. Other symptoms of an asthma attack include: Severe wheezing when breathing both in and out Coughing that won't stop Very rapid breathing Chest pain or pressure Tightened neck and chest muscles, called retractions Difficulty talking Feelings of anxiety or panic Pale, sweaty face Blue lips or fingernails The severity of an asthma attack can escalate rapidly, so it's important to treat these asthma symptoms immediately once you recognize them. Without immediate treatment, such as with your asthma inhaler or bronchodilator, your breathing will become more labored. If you use a peak flow meter at this time, the reading will probably be less than 50%. Many asthma action plans suggestion interventions starting at 80% of normal. As your lungs continue to tighten, you will be unable to use the peak flow meter at all. Unfortunately, some people interpret the disappearance of wheezing as a sign of improvement and fail to get prompt emergency care. If you do not receive adequate asthma treatment, you may eventually be unable to speak and will develop a bluish coloring around your lips. This color change, known as cyanosis, means you have less and less oxygen in your blood. Without aggressive treatment for this asthma emergency, you may lose consciousness and eventually die. If you are experiencing an asthma attack, follow the \"Red Zone\" or emergency instructions in your asthma action plan immediately. Asthma affects as many as 10% to 12% of children in the United States and is the leading cause of chronic illness in children. While asthma symptoms can begin at any age, most children have their first asthma symptoms by age 5. Chronic coughing with asthma may be the only obvious sign, and a child's asthma may go unrecognized if the cough is attributed to recurrent bronchitis. Not everyone with asthma has the usual symptoms of cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath. Some \"unusual\" asthma symptoms may include the following: rapid breathing sighing fatigue inability to exercise properly (called exercise-induced asthma) difficulty sleeping or nighttime asthma anxiety difficulty concentrating chronic cough without wheezing Also, asthma symptoms can be mimicked by other conditions such as bronchitis, vocal cord dysfunction, and even heart failure. For instance, you might have a cold virus that triggers your asthma symptoms. It's important to know the signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infections and to call your health care provider immediately for diagnosis and treatment. For instance, you might have symptoms of increased shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, or wheezing with a bronchial infection. Then take the proper medications as prescribed to eliminate the infection and regain control of your asthma and health."], [1318, "Atrial Fibrillation When to Call a Doctor", "Most episodes of atrial fibrillation aren't life-threatening, but an irregular heartbeat can cause complications like a heart attack or stroke. When you're prepared to spot and handle what's going on, you can help your loved one get the medical care he needs faster, and ease your worries, too. To get started, make a list of their health conditions and the medications they take. You'll also want to know what happens during an AFib episode, heart attack, and stroke, and the different warning signs of each. What it is: When the heart beats irregularly, causing it to flutter, race, pound, or noticeably skip beats, that's an AFib episode. The symptoms: Your loved one may be very tired and short of breath. AFib episodes rarely cause serious problems, but your loved one will need to have a physical exam. If he's uncomfortable or his heart is beating rapidly, call 911 or go to an emergency room. Doctors may use medications or a device called a defibrillator to help his heart go back to a normal rhythm. What it is: A heart attack happens when blood doesn't flow to the organ like it should because of a blockage. The symptoms: The main ones are discomfort, pain, pressure, or heavinessin the chest.A heart attack can also cause shortness of breath, nausea, confusion, and exhaustion. How to help: If you notice these warning signs, call 911 right away, even if you're not sure if it's a heart attack. Your loved one is five times more likely to have a stroke than other people.

You might have to adjust your routine because of your symptoms or the medicine you take to treat them. Here are a few simple changes you can make and good habits you can practice to protect your heart and help you feel your best: A diet heavy on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy is always a good idea. Here are a few other diet tips for people who have AFib: Go to a low-fat, low-salt diet. Avoid saturated fat, trans fat, and salt to help control your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Watch how much soda, coffee, tea, energy drinks, and chocolate you have. If you take blood thinners, alcohol could make you bleed too much. Your body uses vitamin K to help your blood clot. Eating a lot or very little of this vitamin can affect how well your medicine works. Staying active will help control your weight, improve your sleep, and make your heart stronger. See your doctor before you start any new fitness program to make sure the activity is safe for you. If your heart goes out of rhythm during a workout, stop and rest. You have a higher chance of AFib when you are too heavy. It also makes your AFib more likely to come back after a procedure such as ablation. To manage your condition, try to lose at least 10% of your body weight with diet and exercise if your doctor or dietician has told you that you're obese. Smoking also damages your blood vessels and raises your chances for heart disease and a heart attack. Ask your doctor to recommend a method, such as medicine or nicotine replacement, to help you quit. When you feel anxious, try relaxation techniques such as these: Deep breathing Exercise Massage Meditation Yoga If your stress feels overwhelming, see a therapist or seek out a support group for help. If you snore or feel like you never get a good night's rest, see your doctor for a diagnosis. Your doctor will prescribe medicine or other treatments to control your heart rhythm and prevent blood clots.

Cardioversion: A doctor gives you a mild electric shock to reset your heart rhythm. First, you'll have a test called a \"transesophageal echocardiography\" (TEE) to see whether you have any blood clots in the top chambers of your heart, called the atria. Ablation: Your doctor burns off the tiny parts of your heart that are causing the abnormal beats. She threads a thin tube, called a catheter, through a blood vessel in your leg or groin up to your heart. Left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion: Most strokes in people with AFib happen when blood clots form in the upper left part of their heart, the left atrium. LAA occlusion seals off this part of the heart to prevent blood clots and strokes. Your doctor can do surgery or use a catheter that she inserts into a blood vessel in your leg.Maze procedure: During this type of surgery, the doctor makes very small cuts in the top part of your heart. If problems such as high blood pressure, cholesterol, or an overactive thyroid caused your AFib, you'll need to treat the underlying cause. Your doctor may also recommend screening and treatment for sleep apnea, a disorder in which breathing starts and stops throughout the night. You might also need to make these changes to your daily life to keep your heart healthy: Limit sugar, salt, and fat in your diet Quit smoking Cut down on alcohol and caffeine Exercise and eat healthier to control your weight Avoid certain cough and cold medicines that contain stimulants, which make your heart beat faster"], [1322, "Atrial Fibrillation Types", "Atrial fibrillation, also called AFib, is a common heart condition. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is when your heart goes in and out of normal rhythm for less than a week. You may not need treatment with this type of AFib, but you should see a doctor. If the heart isn't used to all this different activity, it may go into AFib. It might stop on its own, but it's possible you could need medicine or treatment to stop it. If that doesn't work, they might use a low-voltage current to reset your heart's rhythm back to normal. This means your AFib has lasted for more than a year and doesn't go away. Doctors can use another kind of treatment, such as ablation (which burns certain areas of your heart's electrical system) to restore your normal heart rhythm. If you have this type, you and your doctor will decide whether or not you may need long-term medication to control your heart rate and lower your risk of stroke. Valvular atrial fibrillation means that your AFib is caused by a heart valve problem. Some of these might include an artificial heart valve, valvular stenosis (meaning that one of your heart valves has stiffened), or regurgitation (meaning that you have a heart valve that isn't closing property and lets some blood flow the wrong way). Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is atrial fibrillation that isn't caused by a problem with a heart valve. The main reason why it matters if your AFib is \"valvular\" or \"nonvalvular\" is because it affects what type of medicine your doctor will prescribe to help lower your risk of stroke. There are a lot of options to treat atrial fibrillation, no matter which type you have. If you have symptoms, see your doctor to discuss what will be best for you."], [1323, "Atrial Fibrillation Tests", "So if your doctor suspects you have atrial fibrillation (AFib), he may ask for tests to confirm the diagnosis, find out what's causing it, and figure out the best way to treat it. Sometimes your primary care or family doctor will be the one who diagnoses AFib. First, the doctor will ask detailed questions about your symptoms, health habits, and health problems you or another family member have had. During the physical exam, he's likely to: Listen to your heartbeat's rate and rhythm Take your pulse and blood pressure Listen to your lungs Check for signs of heart muscle or valve problems This simple, painless test is the most helpful. It can show the: Speed of your heartbeat Rhythm of your heartbeat Strength and timing of electrical signals passing through your heart A doctor or technician places small patches, called electrodes, on different areas of your body, including several on your chest. These pick up signals that make wave patterns on the EKG results. It gives your doctor a picture of your heart's overall electrical activity. But because the test is a quick snapshot, a standard EKG won't always catch AFib. The extra time gives a better chance of picking up an abnormal heart rhythm, what doctors call an arrhythmia. Or you might have to push a button when you feel: Dizzy Weak Lightheaded A racing or fluttering heart You may need to wear it for a couple of months -- as long as it takes to catch and record the trouble. It's just what it sounds like: A test that puts extra stress on your heart to see how it responds to working hard and beating fast. You'll be hooked up to an EKG during the test, and the technician will watch your heart rate and blood pressure, too. Exercise is an easy way to get your heart pumping. If your body can't handle intense activity, you can take a special medicine that makes your heart work harder instead. This test uses sound waves and a computer to create a moving picture of your heart. An \"echo\" gives your doctor information about: The size and shape of your heart How well the heart chambers and valves are working Where the heart muscle isn't contracting the right way Areas of poor blood flow Previous injuries poor blood flow has caused The same device makes the sound waves and picks them up bouncing back. To get closer to your heart so it's easier to make clear pictures and see blood clots, he can feed the device through your mouth and down your throat while you're sedated and won't feel it. These can point your doctor to what might be causing your AFib. Blood tests may check for infection, thyroid, and kidney problems, signs of a heart attack, and more."], [1324, "Atrial Fibrillation Symptoms", "If your heart races rather than beats and the feeling lasts for a few minutes, that's a sign you might have a condition called atrial fibrillation. When you have this condition, faulty electrical signals make your heart flutter or beat too fast. AFib raises your chances for a stroke and other heart complications. If you have AFib, you might instead feel a flutter or quiver in your chest when your heart beats. Your heart might beat faster than usual, pound, or race. A few things can affect whether you have symptoms and how severe they are, including: Your age -- older people often don't have symptoms What caused your AFib How much it affects your heart's ability to pump Along with the fluttering or racing heart, you might have pain and pressure in your chest. You may also feel: Confused Dizzy Faint Short of breath Sweaty Tired Weak Some of these symptoms, such as shortness of breath or chest pain, can mimic those of a heart attack. If you're not sure whether you've got AFib or you're having a heart attack, call your doctor or 911. The fluttering goes on longer with some forms than others: Paroxysmal fibrillation last 7 days or less Persistent AFib lasts for more than 7 days Permanent AFib doesn't go away If your AFib continues for many months or years, you can reach the point where you barely notice the symptoms. Your doctor may have to treat you to bring your heart back into the right rhythm. Call your doctor if your heart doesn't go back into a normal rhythm within a few minutes, or your symptoms get worse. Call 911 right away if you have these symptoms, which could be signs of a heart attack or stroke: Pain or pressure in the middle of your chest that lasts more than a few minutes Pain that spreads to your jaw, neck, arms, back, or stomach Nausea Cold sweat Drooping face Arm weakness Trouble speaking Your doctor will do tests to check your heartbeat and the electrical impulses in your heart. If you do have an irregular heartbeat, you can get treatments to bring it back into a normal rhythm. You may also need treatments to lower your heart rate, or you may not need anything done at all. Your doctor may also recommend medication to lower your chance of stroke."], [1325, "Atrial Fibrillation Causes", "Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is the most common problem with the heartbeat's rate or rhythm. Disorganized signals make the heart's two upper chambers (the atria) squeeze very fast and out of sync. They contract so quickly that the heart walls quiver, or fibrillate. It can happen because the heart's electrical system has been damaged, typically from other conditions that affect the heart. But in at least 1 of every 10 AFib cases, other things may be at play. Even after you've been diagnosed with the condition, you may be able to control your AFib and avoid having an episode if you know what triggers them for you. As people grow older, they're more likely to develop heart disease and other conditions that can cause AFib. Since AFib is a problem with your heart, it's not surprising that other heart issues raise the risk of AFib, including: Coronary artery disease Heart valve disease Rheumatic heart disease Heart failure Weakened heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) Heart birth defects Inflamed membrane or sac around the heart (pericarditis) Sick sinus syndrome can also make it more likely. Medical problems not related to your heart can also increase the likelihood that you'll have AFib: High blood pressure Lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or emphysema, or a blood clot in your lung (pulmonary embolism) An overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) Obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome Sleep apnea Infections caused by a virus Newer research suggests that people who take high doses of steroids, perhaps for asthma or other conditions that cause inflammation, may be at greater risk for AFib. Caffeine, cigarettes, and other stimulant drugs can set off AFib. When you're under a lot of stress or feeling worn out, that could trigger an episode or make your symptoms worse."], [1326, "APLS", "Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is one of those, but plenty of people with APS never have symptoms, and there are very good treatments for those who do. APS is a disorder that affects how your blood clots, which can cause lots of issues in your body. It mostly affects young women, and sometimes the reason why you develop is unclear. But doctors do know a lot about how APS works and how to treat it. Normal antibodies fight infections, but with this condition, things called \"autoantibodies\" attack certain fats that help with blood clotting. APS antibodies can sometimes cause: Blood clots, which can lead to heart attack, stroke, or pulmonary embolism Miscarriages and other pregnancy complications Low platelet levels in your blood Rashes and skin ulcers Plenty of people with the APS antibodies never have symptoms, though. No one is certain why some people develop APS antibodies, but doctors do know that your chances are higher if you: Have an infection like HIV, syphilis, hepatitis C, or Lyme disease Are taking amoxicillin or certain blood pressure, heart-rhythm, and seizure medications Have lupus (about half of people with lupus also have APS) Have relatives with APS Again, if you have the APS antibodies you might never show signs of APS. But you're more likely to have symptoms of a blood clot if you: Get pregnant Have surgery Are obese Sit for a long time (like on bed rest or a long flight) Smoke Take birth control pills Have high cholesterol or high blood pressure Blood clots are the most common symptom of APS. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that commonly occurs in the deep veins of the leg (the ones closest to the bones), which carry a lot of blood to the heart. Brain clots in the blood vessels of the brain can also cause headaches, dementia, seizures, and strokes. Clots that travel to the lungs can cause a blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries (pulmonary embolism). Women with APS can have a hard time getting pregnant, and blood clots that form in the placenta can cause miscarriage, premature birth, and development issues with babies. Just having the antibodies doesn't mean that you have APS -- you also must have some of the health problems related to it. If your doctor suspects APS, you have to take two blood tests. To prevent another clot from happening again, some people have to take oral blood thinners for longer periods of time. Pregnant women with APS get injections of blood thinners and low doses of aspirin for the entire pregnancy, up until just before delivery. It's also important to treat any other conditions that put you at risk for blood clots, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, and other autoimmune disorders. You also need to stop smoking and stop estrogen therapy (either for menopause or birth control) if you have APS."], [1327, "Atrial Fibrillation What is Atrial Fibrillation", "Those little thumps you feel are your heart pumping, moving blood into and out of its chambers and through the rest of your body. Normally, the top part of your heart (the atria) squeezes first, then the bottom part (the ventricles). Because your blood isn't moving well, you're at greater risk for heart failure. If one gets stuck in your brain, you can have a stroke. Other heart problems can make it more likely: Heart disease due to high blood pressure Heart valve disease Heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy) Heart defect from birth (congenital heart defect) Heart failure Past heart surgery People with certain medical conditions have a greater chance, too: Long-term lung disease (such as COPD) Overactive thyroid gland Sleep apnea Certain medicines (including adenosine, digitalis, and theophylline) can raise the risk of AFib. Sometimes, it's linked to: Heavy alcohol, caffeine, or drug use Infections Genetics When your heart is in AFib, you might feel: Like your heart is racing or fluttering in your chest (palpitations) Fatigued or weak Dizzy or lightheaded Chest pain or pressure Short of breath If you have these symptoms, call your doctor and make an appointment as soon as possible. If you're at risk, talk to your doctor about your chances for having AFib, and get regular checkups. The main thing your doctor wants to see is the electrical activity in your heart. An electrocardiogram (EKG) uses small, sticky sensors placed on your chest to record what's happening. Your doctor may want you to wear a Holter monitor for a few days while you go about your regular activities. It's like a mobile EKG that continuously records what's going on with your heart, so your doctor can look for signs of an arrhythmia. If your AFib symptoms come and go, you may need a different kind of monitor for a longer time. Your doctor might ask for other tests and imaging, including: Blood tests to check your thyroid, liver, and kidneys A chest X-ray, if you might have lung disease An echocardiogram, which uses sound waves to make a video of your heart working Special X-rays, called CT, that make a 3-D picture of your heart An MRI, which uses magnets and radio waves to create snapshots and videos of your heart An exercise stress test Depending on how severe your symptoms are, you doctor may recommend medications, surgical procedures, or even a pacemaker to get and keep your heart in a normal rhythm. Your doctor can give you medicine to: Slow your heart rate and ease the strength of contractions (beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers) Bring your heart's rhythm back to normal (sodium and potassium channel blockers) Prevent blood clots (\"blood thinners\" or anticoagulants, and antiplatelets) When medications don't work, doctors can try electrical cardioversionto reset your heart's rhythm. This uses pads stuck on your chest to send an electric shock to your heart. Your doctor can also stop the short-circuiting in your heart by burning off the tissue on the surface of your heart that's causing the problem, or creating scar tissue that doesn't pass the offbeat signals. Usually, he'll get to your heart through a small tube placed in a blood vessel, and then use a laser, radio waves, or extreme cold. If you're having open heart surgery for another reason, your doctor might do the maze procedure, which is similar to ablation. It runs on batteries and sends little electrical bursts to your heart when it beats too slowly. You can protect your heart by the choices you make in your daily life, too. Eat a healthy diet that includes plenty of fresh vegetables and fruits, along with whole grains and lean protein. It helps keep your muscles strong, your blood moving, and your weight in check. Talk to your doctor about the best activities for you, so you don't overdo it."], [1328, "Autism Related Information", "Asperger's Syndrome Autism Spectrum Disorders Caregiver Tips Depression in Children and Teens Down Syndrome Epilepsy Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)"], [1329, "Autism Home Treatment", "Having a child with autism requires taking a proactive approach to learning about the condition and its treatment while working closely with others involved in your child's care. You also need to take care of yourself so that you are able to face the many challenges of having a child with autism. Ask your doctor or contact autism groups to find training about autism and how to manage symptoms. Parent and family education can reduce family stress and improve a child's functioning. Understanding the condition and knowing what to expect is an important part of helping your child develop independence.6 Become informed about your child's educational rights. Federal laws require services for handicapped children, including those with autism. Also, there may be state and local laws or policies to aid children who have autism. Learning about autism will also help prepare you for when your child reaches adulthood. Close communication with others involved in your child's education and care will help all concerned. The best treatment for children with autism is a team approach and a consistent, structured program. Everyone involved needs to work together to set goals for: Education. Not only does physical activity promote a healthy weight and body, but it also provides opportunities to build self-esteem, confidence, and friendships with other children. Work with your child's doctors to learn how physical activities may be best worked into your child's routine. If possible, keep televisions, video games, and computers out of your child's bedroom. When children with ASDs have these devices in their bedroom, they are more likely to sleep fewer hours. Children with autism often have picky eating habits or may take a long time to acquire tastes for new foods. You may try preparing the food in a different way, such as blending a banana in a smoothie instead of having your child eat the banana. Learn ways to handle the normal range of emotions, fears, and concerns that go along with raising a child who has autism. The daily and long-term challenges put you and your other children at an increased risk for depression or stress-related illnesses. Get involved in a hobby, visit with friends, and learn ways to relax. For more information on support groups in your area, contact the Autism Society of America at www.autism-society.org.

Symptoms and behaviors of autism can combine in many ways and vary in severity. Also, individual symptoms and behaviors often change over time. For these reasons, treatment strategies are tailored to individual needs and available family resources. But in general children with autism respond best to highly structured and specialized treatment. A program that addresses helping parents and improving communication, social, behavioral, adaptive, and learning aspects of a child's life will be most successful. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends the following strategies for helping a child to improve overall function and reach his or her potential:6 Behavioral training and management . Behavioral training and management uses positive reinforcement, self-help, and social skills training to improve behavior and communication. Many types of treatments have been developed, including Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA), Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), and sensory integration. These therapies are important components of managing autism and should all be included in various aspects of the child's treatment program. Occupational therapy may also help a child with autism to learn to process information from the senses (sight, sound, hearing, touch, and smell) in more manageable ways. Medicines are most commonly used to treat related conditions and problem behaviors, including depression, anxiety, hyperactivity, and obsessive-compulsive behaviors. Stories about alternative therapies, such as secretin and auditory integration training, have circulated in the media and other information sources. When you are thinking about any type of treatment, find out about the source of the information and about whether the studies are scientifically sound. But numerous studies have failed to show any evidence of a link between autism and the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.7If you avoid having your children immunized, you put them and others in your community at risk for developing serious diseases, which can cause serious harm or even death."], [1331, "Autism Exams and Tests", "The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends screening children for autism during regularly scheduled well-child visits.5 This policy helps doctors identify signs of autism early in its course. When a developmental delay is recognized in a child, further testing can help a doctor find out whether the problem is related to autism, another autism spectrum disorder, or a condition with similar symptoms, such as language delays or avoidant personality disorder. If your primary care provider does not have specific training or experience in developmental problems, he or she may refer your child to a specialist-such as a developmental pediatrician, a psychiatrist, a speech therapist, a psychologist, or a child psychiatrist-for the additional testing. Various guidelines and questionnaires are used to help a doctor determine the specific type of developmental delay a child has. During the medical history interview, a doctor asks general questions about a child's development, such as whether a child shows parents things by pointing to objects. Young children with autism often point to items they want, but do not point to show parents an item and then check to see if parents are looking at the item being pointed out. The American Association of Childhood and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) has established guidelines for diagnosing autism.2 The criteria are designed so a doctor can assess a child's behavior relating to core symptoms of autism. The parents may be asked to interpret whether certain behaviors are usual for the child in those circumstances.Developmental and intelligence tests.

An electroencephalograph (EEG), which is done if there are symptoms of seizures, such as a history of staring spells or if a person reverts to less mature behavior (developmental regression). All doctors who see infants and children for well-child visits should watch for early signs of developmental disorders. Developmental screening tools, such as the Ages and Stages Questionnaire or the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), can help assess behavior. If a doctor discovers the following obvious signs of developmental delays, the child should immediately be evaluated:5 No babbling, pointing, or other gestures by 12 months No single words by 16 months No 2-word spontaneous phrases by 24 months, with the exception of repeated phrases (echolalia) Any loss of any language or social skills at any age If there are no obvious signs of developmental delays or any unusual indications from the screening tests, most infants and children do not need further evaluation until the next well-child visit. But children who have a sibling with autism should continue to be closely monitored, because they are at increased risk for autism and other developmental problems.

Younger children with autism often focus on parts of toys, such as the wheels on a car, rather than playing with the entire toy. For example, a child with autism may always need to eat bread before salad and insist on driving the same route every day to school. Symptoms of autism are usually noticed first by parents and other caregivers sometime during the child's first 3 years. Although autism is present at birth (congenital), signs of the disorder can be difficult to identify or diagnose during infancy. Sometimes, a child with autism will start to talk at the same time as other children the same age, then lose his or her language skills. It often seems that a child with autism does not hear, yet at other times, he or she may appear to hear a distant background noise, such as the whistle of a train. Contrary to popular myths about children with autism, very few are completely socially isolated or \"live in a world of their own.\" During the teen years, the patterns of behavior often change. At least 33% are able to achieve at least partial independence.2 Some adults with autism need a lot of assistance, especially those with low intelligence who are unable to speak. At the other end of the spectrum, adults with high-functioning autism are often successful in their professions and able to live independently, although they typically continue to have some difficulties relating to other people. Many people with autism have symptoms similar to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). But these symptoms, especially problems with social relationships, are more severe for people with autism. About 10% of people with autism have some form of savant skills-special limited gifts such as memorizing lists, calculating calendar dates, drawing, or musical ability.1 Many people with autism have unusual sensory perceptions. For example, they may describe a light touch as painful and deep pressure as providing a calming feeling. Sleep problems occur in about 40% to 70% of people with autism.3 Almost half of the children who have autism spectrum disorders tend to \"wander off\" from a caregiver, or \"elope.\" For many caregivers of these children, elopement is one of the most stressful behaviors they must learn to cope with. Studies show that behavioral assessment interventions, such as applied behavioral analysis, may reduce the number of times a child wanders off.4 Autism is one of several types of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), once known as pervasive developmental disorders. It is not unusual for autism to be confused with other ASDs, such as Asperger's syndrome, or to have overlapping symptoms. Also, other conditions with similar symptoms may also have similarities to or occur with autism."], [1333, "Autism Topic Overview", "Autism is a brain disorder that often makes it hard to communicate with and relate to others.

It's important to make sure that your child gets all childhood vaccines. They help keep your child from getting serious diseases that can cause harm or even death. Usually, parents first notice that their toddler has not started talking yet and is not acting like other children the same age. But it is not unusual for a child with autism to start to talk at the same time as other children the same age, then lose his or her language skills. A child may seem to be deaf, even though hearing tests are normal. Repeated and overused types of behavior, interests, and play. Examples include repeated body rocking, unusual attachments to objects, and getting very upset when routines change. People can have many different kinds of behaviors, from mild to severe. Parents often say that their child with autism prefers to play alone and does not make eye contact with other people. Autism may also include other problems: Many children with autism have below-normal intelligence. Teenagers with autism often become depressed and have a lot of anxiety, especially if they have average or above-average intelligence. Some children get a seizure disorder such as epilepsy by their teen years. There are guidelines your doctor will use to see if your child has symptoms of autism. The guidelines put symptoms into categories such as: Social interactions and relationships. Older children and adults may be fascinated by certain topics, like trading cards or license plates. Your child may also have a hearing test and some other tests to make sure that problems are not caused by some other condition. Treatment for autism involves special behavioral training. Behavioral training rewards appropriate behavior (positive reinforcement) to teach children social skills and to teach them how to communicate and how to help themselves as they grow older. With early treatment, most children with autism learn to relate better to others. Medicine is sometimes used to treat problems such as depression or obsessive-compulsive behaviors. So be sure to work with everyone involved in your child's education and care to find the best way to manage symptoms. An important part of your child's treatment plan is making sure that other family members get training about autism and how to manage symptoms. Training can reduce family stress and help your child function better. Some families need more help than others. Take advantage of every kind of help you can find. Family, friends, public agencies, and autism organizations are all possible resources. Planned breaks will help the whole family. Get extra help when your child gets older.

It can feel like a heart attack, but often it's a warning sign. The chest pain happens because there isn't enough blood flowing to part of your heart. It's a symptom of heart disease, and it's occurs when something blocks the arteries or there's a decreased blood flow in the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your heart. Usually, medicine along with lifestyle changes can control it. Or you may need what's called a stent, a tiny tube that props open arteries. There are different types of angina: Stable angina is the most common. Physical activity or stress can trigger it. It usually lasts a few minutes, and it goes away when you rest. It isn't a heart attack, but it can be a sign that you're more likely to have one. The pain can be strong and long-lasting, and come back again and again. It can be a signal that you're about to have a heart attack, so see a doctor right away. Prinzmetal's angina (also called variant angina) is rare. The heart arteries suddenly tighten or narrow. It can cause a lot of pain, and you should get it treated. Angina is usually due to heart disease. A fatty substance called plaque builds up in your arteries, blocking blood flow to the heart muscle. This forces your heart to work with less oxygen. You may also have blood clots in the arteries of your heart, which can cause heart attacks. Other, less common causes of chest pain include: A blockage in a major artery of the lungs (pulmonary embolism) An enlarged or thickened heart (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) Narrowing of a valve in the main part of the heart (aortic stenosis) Swelling of the sac around the heart (pericarditis) Tearing in the wall of the aorta, the largest artery in your body (aortic dissection) Chest pain is the symptom, but it affects people differently. You may feel: Aching Burning Discomfort Feeling of fullness in the chest Heaviness Pressure Squeezing You're likely to have pain behind your breastbone, but it can spread to your shoulders, arms, neck, throat, jaw, or back. Men often feel pain in their chest, neck, and shoulders. Women may feel discomfort in their belly, neck, jaw, throat, or back. You may also have shortness of breath, sweating, or dizziness. For people with mild angina, medicine and lifestyle changes can often help blood flow better and control symptoms. Your doctor might prescribe medicines to: Widen blood vessels, letting more blood flow to the heart Slow the heart down so it doesn't have to work as hard Relax blood vessels to let more blood flow to the heart Prevent blood clots If meds aren't enough, you may need to have blocked arteries opened with a medical procedure or surgery. This could be: Angioplasty /stenting: The doctor threads a tiny tube, with a balloon inside, through a blood vessel and up to your heart. Then, he inflates the balloon inside the narrowed artery to widen it and restore blood flow. A small tube called a stent may be left inside the artery to help keep it open. The stent is usually permanent and made of metal. It can also be made of a material that the body absorbs over time. The procedure usually takes less than 2 hours. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), or bypass surgery. The surgeon takes healthy arteries or veins from another part of your body and uses them to go around the blocked or narrowed blood vessels. You can expect to stay in the hospital about a week after you have this. You'll be in the intensive care unit for a day or two while nurses and doctors keep a close eye on your heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. You can still lead an active life, but it's important that you listen to your body. Know what triggers your angina, like stress or intense exercise. These lifestyle changes can help protect your heart: Stop smoking . When those are out of normal range, your chance for heart disease can rise. Also: Use stress-relieving measures like meditation, deep breathing, or yoga to relax. If you have chest pain that is new or unusual for you, and you think you may be having a heart attack, call 911 right away. Angina raises your risk of having a heart attack. Consider it a warning sign and make smart choices."], [1335, "anaplastic large-cell lymphoma", "Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a rare type of blood cancer. It's more common in young people, mostly boys. When you have lymphoma, cells called lymphocytes grow out of control. With ALCL, they build up in small glands called lymph nodes or in other parts of your body, like your lungs or skin. ALCL can show up in two ways: In the skin, it's called cutaneous ALCL. In the lymph nodes and other organs, it's called systemic ALCL. This type may need stronger treatment because it is more likely to come back. Researchers don't know what causes ALCL, but they do know it isn't inherited. Often, the first sign of systemic ALCL is swelling in the neck, armpit, or groin, where your legs meet the trunk of your body. You may also have symptoms like: Fatigue Fever Loss of appetite Night sweats Weight loss With cutaneous ALCL, you may first notice one or more raised, red bumps on the skin that don't go away. They can form open sores, and they may itch. When you come in for a visit, your doctor will want to know: When did you first notice changes? To see if you have ALCL, doctors may take a biopsy from a swollen lymph node. Doctors make a small cut in the skin and remove all or part of the lymph node, or use a needle to take a sample. Other tests may be needed, such as: Blood tests Bone marrow biopsy. Chest X-ray, which uses radiation in low doses to make images of organs in your chest. CT. A powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures of the inside of your body. It helps you and your doctor decide the right treatment. Cancer is found in lymph nodes in only one part of the body, like the neck or groin. Cancer is found in two or more groups of lymph nodes. All of the lymph nodes are either above or below the diaphragm, a sheet of muscle between your chest and stomach. ALCL has spread to other organs, such as the liver, bones, or lungs. Have you treated someone with ALCL before? How do I connect with other families facing ALCL? No matter what form of ALCL you have, there are treatments to help. And researchers are hopeful to have new and better options in the future. Your treatment choices will depend on the type of ALCL you have and where it is in the body. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for systemic ALCL, when the cancer is in your lymph nodes and other parts of the body. A kind of chemotherapy called CHOP is used for both ALK-positive and ALK-negative ALCL. The therapy gets its name for the first letters of the drugs it uses: Cytoxan, hydroxydaunorubicin, Oncovin, and prednisolone. If your cancer is ALK-negative, doctors may use CHOP at higher doses. If your cancer doesn't respond to CHOP, you may get another drug called brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris). A stem cell transplant may also be an option for you, but it's a complicated and risky procedure. Doctors inject stem cells into your body to help you grow new cancer-free ones. The stem cells come from your own body, or from a closely matched donor. For primary cutaneous ALCL, treatment may include: Radiation, which uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells Surgery to remove the tumors If the cancer is in many areas of the skin, you may need a combination of chemotherapy drugs. Being diagnosed with cancer can make you feel like you've lost control. Remember that you're in charge of your treatment decisions and how you live your life. While you are getting treatment, you may not feel your best. Some treatments, like chemotherapy, have side effects. You may feel weak or tired, and you may be sick to your stomach To help you feel better: Eat enough calories and protein each day to keep up weight and stay strong. Try several small meals instead of fewer bigger ones. Ask the doctor or nurse for ways to ease nausea and other side effects of treatment. Get support from friends, family members, counselors, or members of your spiritual community. You can also join a support group of other people with ALCL. Wash hands often, and stay away from people who may be sick. They're key to finding out how well the treatment is going, and to deciding if any changes are needed. Every situation is different, but treatment to fight ALCL can work well. Sometimes, the cancer comes back. Take advantage of other therapies that can ease symptoms and help you feel better. Find the support you need, and ask for help when you need it. You may be able to take part in a clinical trial. You can find out more information on anaplastic large-cell lymphoma on the web site of the Lymphoma Research Foundation.

When you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks your own body. With alopecia areata, it's the hair follicles that are attacked. This causes the hair to come out, often in clumps the size and shape of a quarter. The amount of hair loss is different in everyone. It's rare, but you can lose all the hair on your head (alopecia areata totalis) or entire body (alopecia areata universalis). If you think you do have alopocia areata, you may want to see a dermatologist. They can also be given in pill form or rubbed on the skin as an ointment, cream, or foam. This is used when there's a lot of hair loss, or if it happens more than once. If it works, this reaction is actually what makes the hair grow back. This treatment, which is put on the scalp, is already used for pattern baldness. It usually takes about 12 weeks before you see growth, and some users are disappointed in the results. Other treatments for alopecia areata include medications that are sometimes used for other autoimmune disorders. These medicines have differing amounts of success in re-growing hair. Apart from drug treatments, there are other things you can try if you have alopecia areata. Alopecia areata isn't usually a serious medical condition, but it can cause a lot of anxiety and sadness. Remember, even if you lose all your hair, it could grow back. And if it doesn't, there are all kinds of great options if want to cover your hair loss. If you notice sudden hair loss, always check with a doctor. There can be a lot of other reasons for it besides alopecia areata."], [1338, "Allergies to Insect Stings", "If you get stung by a bee, wasp, yellow jacket, hornet, or fire ant, would you know if you had an allergic reaction? Those are the insect stings that most often trigger allergies. By knowing the difference, you can decide if you need to see a doctor. The severity of symptoms from a sting varies from person to person. But in general: A normal reaction sets off pain, swelling, and redness around the sting site. A large local reaction causes swelling that extends beyond the sting site. For example, a person stung on the ankle may have swelling of the entire leg. Large local reactions peak at about 48 hours and then gradually get better over 5 to 10 days. You'll need to get it treated right away. A mild allergic reaction may cause one or more of these symptoms at the site of the sting: Pain Redness Pimple-like spots Mild to moderate swelling Warmth Itching Severe allergic reactions (also called an anaphylactic reaction) are not that common. Symptoms can include: Trouble breathing Hives that appear as a red, itchy rash and spread to areas beyond the sting Swelling of the face, throat, or mouth tissue Wheezing or trouble swallowing Restlessness and anxiety Rapid pulse Dizziness or a sharp drop in blood pressure Get emergency treatment as soon as possible. About 2 million Americans have allergies to the venom of stinging bugs. If stung by a bee, the bee usually leaves a sac of venom and a stinger in your skin. Gently scrape the sac and stinger out with a fingernail or a stiff-edged object like a credit card. Don't squeeze the sac or pull on the stinger, or more venom will get into you. Wash the stung area with soap and water, then apply an antiseptic. Apply a soothing ointment, like a hydrocortisone cream or calamine lotion, and cover the area with a dry, sterile bandage. If swelling is a problem, apply an ice pack or cold compress to the area. Take an over-the-counter oral antihistamine to ease itching, swelling, and hives. Parents of children and people with medical conditions should talk with a pharmacist if they have questions about a medicine's use. If you have a severe allergic sting reaction, you'll need epinephrine, which you can inject yourself before you call 911. You'll still need emergency medical care, even if the symptoms seem to stop. If you've ever had allergic reactions to an insect sting, carry epinephrine with you wherever you go. Learn to recognize insect nests and avoid them. Yellow jackets nest in the ground in dirt mounds or old logs and walls. Hornets and wasps make their homes in bushes, trees, and on buildings. Wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, socks, and shoes when in rural or wooded areas. If you have severe allergies, make sure you have someone with you if you hike, boat, swim, golf, or do other things outdoors, just in case. Spray garbage cans regularly with insecticide, and keep the cans covered. Avoid or remove insect-attracting plants and vines growing in and around the home. Keep an epinephrine kit on hand in case of an emergency, too. For more information on where to get a MedicAlert bracelet, you can call 800-ID-ALERT. These let you give yourself medicine (epinephrine) right away if you're stung, before you get to a doctor for treatment. You'll need a prescription from your doctor to buy one of these kits.

A child may have a small head, flat face, and narrow eye openings, for instance. Children who were exposed to alcohol before they were born may be smaller than other children of the same age. Heavy alcohol use during pregnancy can also lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, or a baby being born early. Although the risk is higher with heavy alcohol use, any amount of alcohol may affect your developing baby. The effects that alcohol has on a developing baby depend on: How much, how often, and at what stage of pregnancy the mother drinks alcohol. The worst effects often are related to heavy alcohol use. Whether the mother used other drugs, smoked, or had poor health for any reason while she was pregnant. If your doctor knows to look for FASD-related problems while you're pregnant, he or she can watch your baby's health both before and after birth. And the doctor will know to do more tests, if needed, as your child grows. If you think you might have a drinking problem, talk with your doctor, counselor, or other support person. Doing this can help you to see and address how alcohol may affect many parts of your life, including your pregnancy. A doctor may be able to spot severe alcohol effects (fetal alcohol syndrome, or FAS) in the child at birth. But less severe effects, such as behavior or learning problems, may not be noticed until the child is in school. Sometimes the doctor can find severe problems before the baby is born. If your doctor knows about your alcohol use, he or she can order a test (ultrasound) to look for signs of FAS in your baby, such as heart defects or growth delays. The cause of problems that are found during the test may not be clear. But the findings alert the doctor to any special care a baby may need after he or she is born. Help for your child may include extra support in school, social skills training, job training, and counseling. Community services may be able to help your family handle the costs of and emotions from raising your child. Finding alcohol effects early, even if they are mild, gives a child the best chance to reach his or her full potential in life. Finding the problem early may help prevent problems in school and mental health problems, such as substance abuse, depression, or anxiety.

Chorioretinal lacunae are small holes in the retina (back part of the eye). These are only visible to a doctor using a device to look into the back of the eye. It is very unusual (maybe impossible) to have Aicardi syndrome without having chorioretinal lacunae. Infants with Aicardi syndrome usually have a type of seizures known as \"infantile spasms\".

Delays in attaining developmental milestones (developmental delays), cognitive impairment, and persistent issues with balance and the presence of continuous dance-like movements of limbs or facial muscles (chorea) may occur independently of episodes of paralysis, weakness or stiffness and persist between episodes. They described an unusual disorder in eight children who demonstrated intermittent episodes of weakness, affecting first one side of the body, then the other, with onset in early childhood, including one child who manifested symptoms as early as 3 months of age.

He will do a physical exam and maybe some tests to rule out any other medical problems that could be to blame. Your doctor will usually treat agoraphobia with therapy, medication, or a combination. You may also learn relaxation and breathing exercises. Sometimes your therapist may suggest exposure therapy, in which you try to slowly do some of the things that make you anxious. There are many drugs that your doctor might suggest for agoraphobia. The most common kinds are antidepressants and anti-anxiety medicines. Doctors often start with a low dose of one of these medicines that raises the level of a \"feel-good\" chemical in your brain, called serotonin. Some of the medications that raise serotonin are Celexa, Effexor, Zoloft, Lexapro, and Prozac.

Bone marrow is the soft, spongy tissue that fills the center of most bones. Bone marrow contains specialized cells called hematopoietic stem cells that grow and eventually develop into one of the three main types of blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets. In primary myelofibrosis, a change in the DNA of a single hematopoietic stem cell causes the abnormal cell to continually reproduce itself. Eventually, these abnormal cells crowd out normal, healthy cells in the marrow and, along with scarring within the marrow, disrupt the production of red and white blood cells and platelets. The symptoms associated with primary myelofibrosis vary and are related to the abnormalities affecting blood cell production. Eventually, affected individuals may develop fatigue, fever, frequent infections, pale skin, night sweats and unexplained weight loss. This group of disorders is characterized by the overproduction (proliferation) of one or more of the three main blood cell lines - red or white blood cells or platelets.

Ideally, you can take charge of anorexia with the help of a team that includes a mental health professional (such as a psychologist or licensed counselor), a medical health professional (such as a doctor or nurse), and a registered dietitian. If your medical condition is not life-threatening, your treatment likely will include: Medical treatment. If malnutrition or starvation has started to break down your body, medical treatment will be a top priority. Your doctor will treat the medical conditions that have been caused by anorexia, such as osteoporosis, heart problems, or depression. As you begin to get better, your doctor will continue to follow your health and weight. A registered dietitian will help you take charge of your weight in a healthy way. You will learn healthy eating patterns and gain a good understanding of nutrition.

In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in prescription drug misuse or abuse. This increase has led to a corresponding increase in ER visits because of accidental overdoses as well as admissions to drug treatment programs for drug addictions. It causes compulsive drug seeking and use despite harmful consequences to the addicted person as well as the people around that person. The abuse of drugs -- even prescription drugs -- leads to changes in the structure and function of the brain. Over a period of time, however, changes in the brain caused by repeated drug abuse affect a person's self control and ability to make sound decisions. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the three classes of prescription drugs that are often abused include: Opioids used to treat pain Central nervous system (CNS) depressants, such as benzodiazepines (Xanax, Valium, Ativan, Klonopin), used to treat anxiety and sleep disorders Stimulants, such as amphetamine and dextroamphetamine (Adderall) or methylphenidate (Concerta, Daytrana, Methylin, Ritalin) used to treat attention deficit disorder and narcolepsy (a sleep disorder). Since the early 1990s, doctors' prescriptions for opioid medications -- such as codeine and morphine (Astramorph, Avinza, Kadian, MS-Contin, Ora-Morph SR) -- have greatly increased. Other drugs in this class include: Fentanyl (Actiq, Duragesic, Fentora) Hydrocodone with acetaminophen (Lorcet, Lortab, Norco, Vicodin) Hydrocodone (Zohydro ER, Hysingla ER) Hydromorphone (Dilaudid, Exalgo) Meperidine (Demerol) Methadone (Dolophine, Methadose) Oxycodone (OxyContin, OxyFast, Roxicodone) Oxycodone with acetaminophen (Roxicet, Endocet,Percocet) Oxycodone and naloxone (Targiniq ER) When they're taken as prescribed, opioids and other painkillers manage pain quite effectively. However, when used long-term, opioids may lead to drug abuse with physical dependence and/or addiction. When they are taken with substances that depress the central nervous system -- including alcohol, barbiturates, or benzodiazepines such as alprazolam (Xanax), clonazepam (Klonopin), or diazepam (Valium) -- there is a greatly increased risk of respiratory depression, even death. However, opioids such as OxyContin are sometimes inappropriately snorted or injected to increase the euphoric effects. Benzodiazepines depress the central nervous system (CNS). They are used by millions in the U.S. to treat anxiety and sleep disorders, including insomnia. These CNS depressants affect the brain neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). GABA works by decreasing brain activity, which results in a drowsy or calming effect. Barbiturates, including amobarbital (Amytal), pentobarbital (Nembutal), phenobarbital (Luminal), and secobarbital (Seconal), are also CNS depressants. At one time, they were also commonly used to treat insomnia or anxiety on a short-term basis, but because of their dangers in overdosing, they have largely been replaced for those purposes by benzodiazepines. In addition, using CNS depressants with alcohol can slow down your heart and breathing and lead to death. Stimulants give your body a fast jumpstart, causing a great increase in alertness, energy, and attention. Today, stimulants are prescribed to treat problems such as ADHD, ADD, depression, narcolepsy, and other problems. Examples of stimulants include methylphenidate (Concerta, Daytrana, Methylin, Ritalin), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine, Dextrostat, ProCentra), lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse), and the combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine (Adderall). When they are abused -- for instance, by taking the drugs in higher doses or crushing the pills to get a high -- they have the potential for addiction and ongoing abuse. That includes prescriptions for commonly abused drugs such as opioids, CNS depressants, and stimulants. Instead of taking illegal substances commonly sold in back alleys, some teens today tell of having prescription parties where they gather at someone's home, mix their parents' prescription pills in a bowl, and then help themselves to whichever pill looks most appealing. The problem is most teens have no idea what medications they are taking and which medications may cause serious problems, even death, if taken with other drugs or alcohol. As an example, sometimes addictions run in families with a strong genetic link. In addition, social environment including friends or colleagues may also influence addiction. If you are abusing prescription drugs, you may be taking larger doses than your doctor prescribed, or using them for reasons other than prescribed. For instance, if your doctor prescribed a pain medication to be taken three times daily and you find yourself taking the same medication more frequently or taking twice as much, you are abusing prescription drugs. If you take the same pain medication for reasons other than prescribed -- such as, because you feel out of sorts or bored -- this is also an abuse of the prescription medication. This may also be a sign of abusing prescription drugs. According to the FDA, guidelines for using prescription medications safely include: Always follow the prescription medication directions carefully. Learn about possible interactions of the prescription medicine with alcohol and other prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. Never allow other people to use your prescription medications and don't take theirs. There are treatments, including nonaddictive medications that can help people counteract the symptoms of prescription drug addiction and regain control. Buprenorphine is a drug used to treat opiate withdrawal, and is often combined with the drug naloxone (a combination called Suboxone) in order to prevent relapse. A form of buprenorphine has become available that can be implanted under the skin (called Probuphine) and is used for maintenance treatment of opiate dependence in people who have been taking a stable dose of oral buprenorphine and are no longer in the midst of detoxification. Other drug treatments for opiate withdrawal include methadone and the blood pressure medicine clonidine. The drug naltrexone blocks the effects of opiates and is another treatment option for preventing opiate relapse. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, opioids should never be used with substances that cause CNS depression, including: Alcohol Antihistamines Barbiturates Benzodiazepines General anesthetics CNS depressors should never be used with other substances that depress the CNS, such as: Alcohol Prescription opioid pain medicines Some OTC cold and allergy medications Stimulants should be used with caution if combined with other substances that stimulate the nervous system, including: Antidepressants, as supervised by a doctor OTC decongestant medications Some asthma medications If you believe that a family member or close friend is abusing prescription drugs, talk with your health care professional. Many of these programs use outpatient treatment with medications and behavioral therapy. Many people with addiction must experience serious consequences before they acknowledge their illness."], [1357, "Alcohol Abuse Alcohol Abuse", "You may have an alcohol use disorder if you: Drink more, or longer, than you plan to Have tried to cut back or stop more than once and couldn't Spend a lot of time drinking, being sick, or hungover Want alcohol so badly you can't think of anything else Have problems with work, school, or family because of your habit (or because you're sick after having alcohol) Keep drinking even though it has caused problems for you or your relationships Quit or cut back on other activities that were important to you in order to drink Have found yourself in situations while drinking or afterward that made you more likely to get hurt Keep having alcohol even though it made you depressed or anxious, hurt your health, or led to a memory blackout Have to drink more than you used to for the effect you want Found that you had withdrawal symptoms when the buzz wore off, like trouble sleeping, shakiness, restlessness, nausea, sweating, a racing heart, a seizure, or seeing, hearing, or feeling things that aren't there.

A 12-step program is often part of treatment and continues afterward as part of your recovery. It helps you take control of your life so you don't have to depend on drugs. You might start with your family doctor, or your doctor may recommend that you enter a treatment facility. A friend could bring you to a self-help group, such as Narcotics Anonymous, or you might walk into a clinic that deals with drug abuse. A case manager helps plan and manage your treatment. You may be asked questions about your drug use, health problems, work, and living situation. Your team may write a plan, which includes your treatment goals and ways to reach those goals. Your doctor may decide you need medical care to manage withdrawal symptoms when you first quit using drugs. A doctor may prescribe medicines to help with withdrawal symptoms. In group therapy, you talk about your recovery with other people who are trying to quit. In cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), you learn to change the thoughts and actions that make you more likely to use drugs. With motivational interviewing (MI), you resolve mixed feelings you have about quitting and getting treatment. Motivational enhancement therapy (MET) uses motivational interviewing to help you find motivation to quit and get you started toward recovery. Couples or family counseling can help you to stop using drugs, stay drug-free, and improve your relationships with your partner and family. Treatment usually includes going to a support group, such as going to Narcotics Anonymous (NA) meetings. You may take medicines to help you quit or to help you overcome withdrawal symptoms. Medicines often are used for addiction to opiate drugs like heroin or certain painkillers. Medicines that can help you include methadone (such as Dolophine) or naltrexone (such as ReVia). Your treatment team can help you decide which type of program is best for you. In outpatient treatment, you regularly go to a mental health clinic, a counselor's office, a hospital clinic, or a local health department for treatment. In inpatient treatment, you stay at a hospital and have therapies during the day or evening. Residential treatment provides a place for you to live for 6 months or more while you recover. The rewards may get bigger when you go for a long time without drugs. Knowing that you will be tested can make you more likely to resist your cravings.

The toll for this abuse can be seen in our hospitals and emergency departments through direct damage to health by substance abuse and its link to physical trauma. Although use of some drugs such as cocaine has declined, use of other drugs such as heroin and \"club drugs\" has increased. Studies have made it clear that drug education and prevention aimed at children and adolescents offers the best chance to curb abuse nationally. The National Institute on Drug Abuse estimated the number of users of illicit drugs in 2014 in the United States ages 12 and over to be about 7 million. In addition, the survey estimated that 6.4% of Americans (roughly 17 million adults) abuse or are dependent on alcohol. Abused substances produce some form of intoxication that alters judgment, perception, attention, or physical control. Many substances can bring on withdrawal, an effect caused by cessation or reduction in the amount of the substance used. Many substances, such as alcohol, tranquilizers, opiates, and stimulants, over time also can produce a phenomenon known as tolerance, where you must use a larger amount of the drug to produce the same level of intoxication. Tobacco: People cite many reasons for using tobacco, including pleasure, improved performance and vigilance, relief of depression, curbing hunger, and weight control. Withdrawal symptoms of smoking include anxiety, hunger, sleep disturbances, and depression.Smoking is responsible for nearly a half million deaths each year. Tobacco use costs the nation an estimated $300 billion a year, in direct and indirect health care costs and lost productivity.

Tobacco use costs the nation an estimated $300 billion a year, in direct and indirect health care costs and lost productivity. Alcohol: Although many people have a drink as a \"pick me up,\" alcohol actually depresses the brain. Alcohol can cause heart enlargement and increase the risk for cancer of the esophagus and stomach. It can also cause chronic inflammation of the pancreas (chronic pancreatitis) and cirrhosis of the liver, which are both considered to be risk factors for pancreatic cancer.In addition to its direct health effects, officials associate alcohol abuse with nearly half of all fatal motor vehicle accidents.

In addition to its direct health effects, officials associate alcohol abuse with nearly half of all fatal motor vehicle accidents. Marijuana (also known as grass, pot, weed, herb): Marijuana, which comes from the plant Cannabis sativa, is the most commonly used illegal drug in the United States. In 2014, there were 22.2 million Americans age 12 and over who reported using marijuana in the past month, up from 14.4 million (5.8 percent) in 2007. Often, the first illegal drug people use, marijuana is associated with increased risk of progressing to more powerful and dangerous drugs such as cocaine and heroin. The risk for progressing to cocaine is 104 times higher if you have smoked marijuana at least once than if you never smoked marijuana.

The risk for progressing to cocaine is 104 times higher if you have smoked marijuana at least once than if you never smoked marijuana. Cocaine (also known as crack, coke, snow, rock): Cocaine use has gone down in the last few years; from 2007 to 2012, the number of current users in the U.S. ages 12 or older dropped from 2.1 million to 1.7 million. In 2014, the number of adults (ages 12 and older) that reported using cocaine in the previous month was 0.10 percent. Derived from the coca plant of South America, cocaine can be smoked, injected, snorted, or swallowed. Desired effects include pleasure and increased alertness.Short-term effects also include paranoia, constriction of blood vessels leading to heart damage or stroke, irregular heartbeat, and death. Severe depression and reduced energy often accompany withdrawal.Both short- and long-term use of cocaine has been associated with damage to the heart, the brain, the lung, and the kidneys.

According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), in 2012 about 669,000 Americans reported using heroin in the past year, a number that has been on the rise since 2007. Withdrawal can be intense and can include vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, confusion, aches, and sweating.Overdose may result in death from respiratory arrest (stopping breathing). Because heroin is usually injected, often with dirty needles, use of the drug can trigger other health complications including destruction of your heart valves, HIV/AIDS, infections, tetanus, and botulism. Because heroin is usually injected, often with dirty needles, use of the drug can trigger other health complications including destruction of your heart valves, HIV/AIDS, infections, tetanus, and botulism. Methamphetamine (also known as meth, crank, ice, speed, crystal): Use of this drug also has increased, especially in the West. Methamphetamine is a powerful stimulant that increases alertness, decreases appetite, and gives a sensation of pleasure. It shares many of the same toxic effects as cocaine -- heart attacks, dangerously high blood pressure, and stroke. Club drugs: The club scene and rave parties have popularized an assortment of other drugs. These are the more popular club drugs: Ecstasy (also called MDMA, or 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine, as well as Adam, STP): This is a stimulant and hallucinogen used to improve mood and to maintain energy, often for all-night dance parties. GHB is often used as a date-rape drug because it is tasteless, colorless, and acts as a powerful sedative.Rohypnol (also called roofies, roche): This is another sedative that can be used as a date-rape drug. Effects include low blood pressure, dizziness, abdominal cramps, confusion, and impaired memory.Ketamine (also called Special K, K): This is an anesthetic that can be taken orally or injected. Higher doses can cause amnesia, paranoia and hallucinations, depression, and difficulty breathing.LSD (also called acid, microdot) and mushrooms (also called shrooms, magic mushrooms, peyote, buttons): Popular in the 1960s, LSD has been revived in the club scene. Long-term effects include unwanted \"flashbacks,\" psychosis (hallucinations, delusions, paranoia), and mood disturbances.PCP (also known as angel dust, hog, love boat): PCP is a powerful anesthetic used in veterinary medicine.

Use and abuse of substances such as cigarettes, alcohol, and illegal drugs may begin in childhood or the teen years. Factors within a family that influence a child's early development have been shown to be related to increased risk of drug abuse. Chaotic home environment Genetic risks (drug or alcohol abuse sometimes can run in families) Lack of nurturing and parental attachment Factors related to a child's socialization outside the family may also increase risk of drug abuse. Inappropriately aggressive or shy behavior in the classroom Poor social coping skills Poor school performance Association with a deviant peer group Perception of approval of drug use behavior Friends and family may be among the first to recognize the signs of substance abuse. Signs to watch for include the following: Giving up past activities such as sports, homework, or hanging out with new friends Declining grades Aggressiveness and irritability Forgetfulness Disappearing money or valuables Feeling rundown, hopeless, depressed, or even suicidal Sounding selfish and not caring about others Use of room deodorizers and incense Paraphernalia such as baggies, small boxes, pipes, and rolling paper Getting drunk or high on drugs on a regular basis Lying, particularly about how much alcohol or other drugs he or she is using Avoiding friends or family in order to get drunk or high Planning drinking in advance, hiding alcohol, drinking or using other drugs alone Having to drink more to get the same high Believing that in order to have fun you need to drink or use other drugs Frequent hangovers Pressuring others to drink or use other drugs Taking risks, including sexual risks Having \"blackouts\"-forgetting what he or she did the night before Constantly talking about drinking or using other drugs Getting in trouble with the law Drinking and driving Suspension from school or work for an alcohol or drug-related incident If you recognize you have a substance abuse problem and want to quit, a doctor can refer you to community resources. A doctor also may prescribe medications to help reduce cravings and withdrawal or help manage medical complications resulting from substance abuse. Call your doctor if you recognize any of the following symptoms: Mild tremors or an alcohol withdrawal seizure not accompanied by hallucinations or confusion Jaundice (yellow skin and eyes) Increasing abdominal girth Leg swelling Cough that won't go away Continuing feelings of sadness or depression Pain at an injection site Fever If any of the following occur, call 911 or go to a hospital's emergency department immediately: Thoughts of harming yourself or others Chest pain, rapid heartbeat, difficulty breathing, or lightheadedness Severe abdominal pain Confusion or ongoing hallucinations Severe tremors or recurrent seizures Difficulty speaking, numbness, weakness, severe headache, visual changes, or trouble keeping balance Severe pain at an injection site (may be accompanied by redness, swelling, discharge, and fever) Dark, cola-colored urine Any suspicion that you were sexually assaulted while under the influence Most substances abusers believe they can stop using drugs on their own, but a majority who try do not succeed. Research shows that long-term drug abuse alters brain function and strengthens compulsions to use drugs. Treating substance abuse depends on both the person and the substance being used. Behavioral treatment provides you with strategies to cope with your drug cravings and ways to avoid relapse. Your doctor may prescribe medications, such as nicotine patches and methadone, naltrexone or Suboxone, to control withdrawal symptoms and certain drug cravings. Often, a drug user has an underlying mental disorder, one that increases risk for substance abuse. Abuse prevention efforts in schools and community settings now focus on school-age groups. Programs seek to increase communication between parents and their children, to teach resistance skills, and to correct children's misperceptions about cigarettes, alcohol, and drugs and the consequences of their use. Most importantly, officials seek to develop, through education and the media, an environment of social disapproval from children's peers and families. Costs to society In 2002, drug abuse in the U.S. cost around $180 billion in direct health costs, lost productivity, and law enforcement costs. Alcohol abuse in 2003 cost $223 billion in health care expenses, lost workplace productivity, and law enforcement costs. Crime: More than half the economic cost of alcohol and drugs is due to crime. A substance abuser is 18 times more likely to be involved in criminal activity than someone in the general population. Drugs and alcohol have been linked to domestic violence and sexual assault. Among jailed sex offenders, 43% say they were under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of their crime. Behavior: In addition to their direct effects on health, drugs produce other indirect effects. Many drugs lessen inhibitions and increase the likelihood that a person will participate in risky behavior. Studies show that the use of alcohol and drugs among teenagers increases chances for teen pregnancy and contracting HIV/AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases. Any injected drug is associated with contracting HIV/AIDS and hepatitis B and C. Trauma: Up to 75% of injured people treated at emergency departments test positive for illicit or prescription drugs.

You think about food, dieting, and weight all the time. Other people say you are too thin, but when you look in the mirror, you see your body as overweight. Anorexia usually starts in the teen years. The earlier it is treated, the better the chances someone can recover from anorexia. Untreated anorexia can lead to starvation and serious health problems, such as bone thinning (osteoporosis), kidney damage, and heart problems. Some people die from these problems. If you or someone you know has anorexia, get help right away. The longer this problem goes on, the harder it is to overcome. Over time and with treatment, a person with anorexia can feel better and stay at a healthy weight. Eating disorders are complex, and experts don't really know what causes them. But they may be due to a mix of genetics, family behaviors, social factors, and personality traits. You may be more likely to have anorexia if: Other people in your family have an eating disorder, such as anorexia or bulimia nervosa. You have a job or do a sport that stresses body size, such as ballet, modeling, or gymnastics. You are the type of person who tries to be perfect all the time, never feels good enough, or worries a lot.

Treatment can help you get back to and stay at a healthy weight. It can also help you learn good eating habits and learn to feel better about yourself. Because anorexia is both a physical and emotional problem, you may work with a doctor, a dietitian, and a counselor. If your weight has dropped too low, you will need to be treated in a hospital.

With adenosine deaminase severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID), your body's defenses stop working because of a problem with your genes. ADA-SCID is a serious disease that usually shows up early in life. Treatments can help, though, and people who get treatment before an infection happens can live long, healthy lives. As a result, your body doesn't make enough of a certain tool, called an enzyme, that helps your white blood cells protect you from getting sick. Without that protection, you can easily get infections. If your child is born with ADA deficiency, he'll probably get a SCID diagnosis by the time he's 6 months old. If the disease starts later, the symptoms may be less severe. Left untreated, the body becomes less and less able to fight infections, which can be life-threatening. You get ADA-SCID only if both your parents pass on a copy of a faulty gene to you. If you get a copy from just one parent, you won't get the disorder, but you can pass that copy on to your own children. If your baby has this disease, he may have a lot of infections in different parts of his body, including: Ear Sinus Mouth Lung Skin It's common for babies to get infections. Pay special attention if your child has them often and they: Are severe Are long-lasting Are unusual Frequently recur Children with ADA-SCID often have diarrhea and widespread skin rashes. They may also grow slowly and have delayed progress in other development areas like motor and social skills. If the disease doesn't appear until later in childhood or adulthood, the symptoms may be mild at first. The first symptoms may be ear or upper-respiratory infections that keep coming back. Some states screen all newborns for ADA-SCID, and many experts say early testing should be required in all states. Your doctor will want to know: What kind of infections have you (or your child) had? If you find out you or child has ADA-SCID, your doctor may talk with you about genetic counseling and early blood testing of all your children. Your doctor will prescribe antibiotic, antifungal, or antiviral medications to treat any existing infections. Your doctor may also prescribe antibiotics to prevent new infections. A baby or child with ADA-SCID may need to spend some time in an isolated hospital room, but his parents will be able to be with him. Although it doesn't cure the disease, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) may help your immune system work better and prevent infections. In this therapy, you get injections of healthy enzymes, usually from a cow. Doctors will put healthy stem cells into your body to try to rebuild your immune system. It's most successful in infants, and when the donor stem cells come from a close relative. In some cases, people need chemotherapy before getting a transplant to kill damaged cells first. In these studies, researchers add healthy genes to your own cells in a lab and transplant them back into your body to correct faulty cells. If you or your child has ADA-SCID, avoid infections as much as you can. Wash your hands often, stay away from people who are sick, and talk to your doctor before getting any vaccinations. These include rotavirus, MMR, chicken pox, and the flu vaccine that comes in mist form. (You can get other types of flu vaccines that don't have the live virus.) Eat right, exercise, and get enough sleep to help your body stay healthy. Talk through your challenges, and get tips for making your daily life easier. But those who get treatment before infections happen can live long, healthy lives.

This makes parts of your body -- like your hands, feet, and face -- grow too much. Children can have problems with too much growth hormone, but that's a different condition called gigantism. Because of the tumor, your body makes too much growth hormone. Once in a while, tumors in the pancreas, liver, or parts of the brain can cause high levels of growth hormone. That leads to higher levels of another hormone, called insulin-like growth hormone, which causes the symptoms you see. First, your hands and feet usually start to swell. You might notice a change in your ring or shoe size, especially your shoe width. The features in your face -- your lips, nose, and tongue -- often change, becoming larger, swollen, and broader. Your brow and lower jaw may start to jut out from your face. Other symptoms may include: Achy joints, possibly leading to arthritis Stiff, rough body hair Hoarser, deeper voice Pinched nerve problems High blood pressure Heart disease Thickening skin with skin tags Sweating a lot with oily skin Headaches Snoring and sleep apnea, a breathing problem that happens during sleep Weakness and being tired Tingling or pain in fingers (carpal tunnel syndrome) Vision problems Lower sex drive Changes in menstrual cycle and breast discharge in women Erectile dysfunction in men You can sometimes have problems such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, a higher chance of heart disease, and an enlarged heart. To tell for sure if you have acromegaly, your doctor will do blood tests to see if your growth hormone levels are high. Your growth hormone levels can change from minute to minute or day to day. Your doctor will do other tests, such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans, to learn more about the size of the tumor and where it is, or to check on how it has affected your body. When you find out you have acromegaly, you've probably got a lot of questions. How many other people with acromegaly have you treated? Your doctor will work with you to come up with the best treatment plan, taking into account your age, health, and how far along your condition is. There are three ways to treat acromegaly: Surgery Medicine Radiation Surgery is often the first treatment for people with large tumors affecting vital areas, and it works well for most people. To get to it, they'll make a small cut in your nose or the inside of your upper lip. In some cases, your doctor may have you take medicine before the surgery to shrink the tumor. After the surgery, your symptoms may start to get better after only a few days. Your doctor may recommend taking one of these medicines after surgery to help control or cure the disease and bring growth hormone levels back to normal: Somatostatin analogs (lanreotide or octreotide) Growth hormone receptor antagonists (pegvisomant) Dopamine agonists (cabergoline, bromocriptine) Those drugs either lower the level of growth hormone in your blood or block the effects it has on your body. Radiation helps if you have parts of a tumor left after surgery, or if you need more help reducing growth hormone levels after taking medicine. When you get diagnosed with a condition like acromegaly, it can help to connect with other people who have it. If you think it would be helpful to talk with a counselor, your doctor can give you a referral. They'll want to help, but they may not know what to offer, so be specific about what you would find helpful. Work closely with your doctor so you understand your options and what you can expect as your treatment moves forward. You can get information there about joining a support group near you."], [1371, "Acquired Lipodystrophy", "Lipodystrophy is a problem with the way your body uses and stores fat. It often affects the fat that's just under your skin, so it can change the way you look. It also can cause other changes in your body. Other acquired lipodystrophies are: Acquired generalized lipodystrophy (AGL), or Lawrence syndrome Acquired partial lipodystrophy (APL), also called progressive lipodystrophy or Barraquer-Simons syndrome Localized lipodystrophy AGL often shows up in children, but adults can get it, too. Both cause a person to lose fat from her face, so she may look sick or much older than she is. A small dimple of localized lipodystrophy may look odd, but it probably won't cause any other trouble. However, because fat tissue makes the hormone leptin, people with larger areas of acquired lipodystrophy might not have enough of this chemical in their bodies. Leptin tells your body you've eaten enough and to make insulin. Fat could also build up in places it shouldn't, like the blood, heart, liver, and kidneys. Depending on which type of lipodystrophy a person has, it may cause other problems, including diabetes, high cholesterol and triglycerides, liver disease, and kidney failure. Often, doctors don't know what causes acquired lipodystrophy, but some triggers are: An infection, such as measles, pneumonia, infectious mononucleosis, or hepatitis A disease where your immune system attacks your body (called an autoimmune disease) Repeated injections in or pressure on the same place on your body An injury For example, people with diabetes who have to inject insulin daily tend to get localized lipodystrophy where they keep giving themselves shots. That's a good reason to change your injection site often. While all kinds of acquired lipodystrophy cause a loss of body fat, exactly what that means for each person is different. The type your child has will affect: Where it happens How much fat is lost Other effects on her body AGL. She'll lose fat from under the skin all over her body, including her face, arms, legs, palms, and sometimes the soles of her feet. She could look very muscular, and you'll be able to see veins under her skin. She'll probably have extra hair on her upper lip and chin. Some people with AGL have patches of dark, velvety skin in their underarms, on their neck, around their belly button or nipples, or on their hands and feet. Because of the fat loss, a person may have problems using sugar in her body or controlling her blood sugar and triglyceride levels. This type affects just the upper body, on both sides. It usually starts with her face and moves to her neck, arms, and chest. This looks like a dent in the skin, but the skin itself seems fine. When you go to the doctor, he'll do a full exam and ask questions about your child's health: What symptoms have you noticed? Have you had her blood sugar, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels checked? Tests of body fat can confirm the diagnosis. For a skin biopsy, the doctor will cut a small piece of skin and check the cells under a microscope. Your doctor may also look for a pattern of fat loss with: Skinfold thickness measurements, checking how much skin he can pinch between his fingers at specific spots on her body A special X-ray that measures bone mineral density A special whole-body MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures showing tissues with fat Blood tests check: Blood sugar Kidney health Fats Liver enzymes Uric acid If the doctor suspects APL, he'll check her blood for evidence of a specific way the body attacks fat cells. Urine tests check for kidney problems. Since you can't replace the missing body fat, your aim will be to avoid complications of the disease. Physical activity lowers blood sugar and can keep fat from building up dangerously. People with AGL may be able to get metreleptin injections (Myalept) to replace the missing leptin and help prevent other diseases. If your child has or gets diabetes, she'll need to take insulin or other drugs to control her blood sugar. Women with AGL shouldn't use oral birth control or hormone replacement therapy for menopause because they can make levels of certain fats worse. Your doctor may prescribe a lotion or cream to lighten and soften dark skin patches. As your child gets older, she may be able to get plastic surgery to help fill out her face with skin grafts from her thighs, belly, or scalp. Doctors can also use implants and injections of fillers to help reshape facial features. People with APL who have extra fat deposits can use liposuction to get rid of some, but fat may build up again. Talk to your doctor about what approach for her appearance makes sense and when. People may not know how to react or what to say to keep from prying, or offending or embarrassing you and your child. Try to focus your praise on achievements, rather than appearance. But kids will be kids, so prepare her for unkind looks and words. Someone with training can help your child and your family sort out their feelings as they deal with the challenges of this disease. Over time, people with AGL can lose most or all of their body fat. With APL, it typically stops after a few years. You'll need to work closely with your doctor to prevent complications. For example, people with AGL are likely to have heart and liver problems. They might develop autoimmune disorders such as vitiligo (light-colored spots of skin), rheumatoid arthritis, and a kind of hepatitis. People with APL probably won't have the insulin-related problems that often come with AGL. But it can lead to kidneys that don't work well or at all, and drusen, tiny fat deposits in the back of the eyes that may be connected to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Women may get extra fat on their hips and thighs. AGL and APL can be linked to autoimmune disorders, too, including rheumatoid arthritis and celiac disease.

This results in an abnormally high level of acid in the blood (academia) and body tissues. The disorder may be caused by a deficiency of one or more of the enzymes methylmalonyl CoA mutase, methylmalonyl racemase, or adenosylcobalamin synthetic enzymes.

It lets you rise up on your toes and push off when you walk or run. The two main problems are: Achilles tendinopathy. This refers to tiny tears (microtears) in the tissue in and around the tendon. Achilles tendon tear or rupture. An Achilles tendon also can partially tear or completely tear (rupture) . But a complete rupture causes pain and sudden loss of strength and movement. Problems with the Achilles tendon may seem to happen suddenly. But usually they are the result of many tiny tears in the tendon that have happened over time. Achilles tendinopathy is most often caused by overuse or repeated movements during sports, work, or other activities. For example, if you do a lot of pushing off or stop-and-go motions when you play sports, you can get microtears in the tendon. Achilles tendon rupture is most often caused by a sudden, forceful motion that stresses the calf muscle. Symptoms of Achilles tendinopathy include swelling in the ankle area and mild or severe pain. The pain may come on gradually or may only occur when you walk or run. You may have less strength and range of movement in the ankle. Symptoms of an Achilles tendon rupture may include a sudden, sharp pain. Swelling and bruising may occur. Your doctor can tell if you have an Achilles tendon problem by asking questions about your past health and checking the back of your leg for pain and swelling. If your symptoms are severe or don't improve with treatment, your doctor may want you to get an X-ray, ultrasound scan, or MRI. Treatment for mild Achilles tendon problems includes rest, over-the-counter pain medicine, and stretching exercises. You may need to wear well-cushioned shoes and change the way you play sports so that you reduce stress on the tendon. Orthotic shoe devices can also help reduce stress on the tendon. Even in mild cases, it can take weeks to months of rest for the tendon to repair itself. It's important to be patient and not return too soon to sports and activities that stress the tendon. Treatment for severe problems, such as a torn or ruptured tendon, may include surgery or a cast, splint, brace, walking boot, or other device that keeps the lower leg and ankle from moving. Exercise, either in physical therapy or in a rehab program, can help the lower leg and ankle get strong and flexible again.

Rarely, people with certain types of cancer can also develop acanthosis nigricans. Eating a special diet can help reduce circulating insulin and may lead to some improvement of the acanthosis nigricans. When acanthosis nigricans is related to obesity, weight management is an important part of prevention.

How your body ages depends in part on your family (genetic) patterns of aging. But your lifestyle choices have a more powerful impact on how well your body ages. A healthy lifestyle may slow many of these normal effects of aging. With age, the skin becomes less elastic and more lined and wrinkled. You can slow skin aging by using moisturizer and protecting the skin from the sun with sunscreen and sun-protective clothing, such as a hat or cap. It's normal for hair to gradually thin on the scalp, pubic area, and armpits. By age 80, it's common to have lost as much as 2 in. (5 cm) in height. This is often related to normal changes in posture and compression of joints, spinal bones, and spinal discs. Most people in their 40s develop a need for reading glasses as the lenses in the eyes become less flexible (presbyopia). Vision changes can affect your ability to drive safely. Changes in sleep and circadian rhythm occur as you age. You will probably sleep less at night, and you may not sleep as deeply as you did when you were younger. And it's more likely that you'll wake up during the night and/or wake up earlier in the morning. For more information, see the topic Coping With Changing Sleep Patterns as You Get Older. Throughout adulthood, men and women gradually lose some of the mineral content in their bones. The bones get less dense and strong. You can slow natural bone loss and reduce your risk of osteoporosis by getting regular, weight-bearing exercise (such as walking), getting enough calcium and vitamin D, and avoiding lifestyle choices that weaken bones (such as smoking). Over time, the body typically needs less energy, and your metabolism slows. When your muscle mass is reduced, your metabolism slows down. Starting in the third decade of life, the brain's weight, the size of its nerve network, and its blood flow decrease. But the brain adapts to these changes, growing new patterns of nerve endings. You can help keep your brain sharp. And be physically active, to increase blood and oxygen flow to the brain. The heart naturally becomes less efficient as it ages, and your heart has to work a little harder during activity than it did in the past. You'll notice a gradual decline in your energy or endurance from one decade to the next. Regular physical activity plays a key role in keeping your lungs strong. With advancing age, the kidneys decline in size and function. This makes it increasingly important that you minimize the toxins, alcohol, and unnecessary medicine that you take in, and that you drink plenty of water. Age-related changes in the urinary system, decreased mobility, and some medicine side effects can all lead to urinary incontinence. This does not have to be part of normal aging, so talk to your doctor if urinary incontinence is affecting you. Men and women produce lower levels of hormones starting in their 50s.

Anderson says your risk of having the flu is cut by about half if you get the shot. If you still come down with it after you've been vaccinated, it's likely to be shorter and less severe. Who should get it: Everyone -- young, old, and in between -- should get a flu shot, but especially pregnant women, people with long-term health issues, and people over 65. Who shouldn't get it: If you've had a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction to the flu vaccine, or are allergic to eggs, or have had Guillain-Barre syndrome (which causes tingling, weakness, and loss of movement in your muscles), talk to your doctor about whether you should get it. When to get it: It's important to get a shot every year. You should look for a new vaccine batch to hit your doctor's office in late August or September. It's also a safeguard for those most vulnerable to the diseases, like people with compromised immune systems. If you're pregnant, it's especially critical to get the Tdap vaccine. Who shouldn't get it: If you've had seizures or an allergic reaction to Tdap, you may need to avoid it. When to get it: If you're pregnant, you should get the vaccine between your 27th and 36th week. Everyone should have a booster for tetanus and diphtheria (called a Td) every 10 years, or any time you're exposed to tetanus. If you work with or are around infants, be sure to get your Tdap at least two weeks before coming into contact with them.

If you're sick when you're scheduled to get either shot, move the appointment to when you're well. If you're pregnant, ask your doctor before getting the hepatitis A shot. How you get it: The hepatitis A vaccine comes in two doses, 6 months apart. There is also a combination vaccine that protects against hepatitis A and B. The infection it causes can lead to cervical, vulvar, and vaginal cancers in women, and penile cancer in men. Who should get it: The HPV vaccine is recommended for boys and girls at age 11 or 12 so they're protected before ever being exposed to the virus. However, women younger than 26 and men who aren't yet 21 can still get it. Men who are in sexual relationships with other men can get the vaccine until age 26. Who shouldn't get it: People who are allergic to it or are pregnant. How you get it: The HPV vaccine comes in three doses. Your doctor will give you the second shot a month or two after the first. Who should get it: Your doctor should recommend this vaccine once you turn 65. If you are at least 19 years old, you should also consider it if you: Live with chronic illness Have sickle cell disease Have a cochlear implant Have a transplanted organ Have HIV or another illness that affects your immune system You're also at higher risk of getting the disease if you smoke. When you should get it: The CDC recommends 2 pneumococcal vaccines for all adults 65 years or older. You should receive a dose of PCV13 first, followed by a dose of PPSV23 at least 1 year later. Who should get it: If you were born after 1957, haven't gotten your MMR vaccine, and have never had measles, you should see your doctor about getting the shot. It's also good for College students Teachers Health care workers People who travel outside the U.S. Who shouldn't get it: If you're pregnant, have HIV or AIDS, are taking medication for cancer, or have a blood disorder, avoid it. Also, if you've had another vaccine within four weeks, recently had a blood transfusion, or are ill, you may need to delay your shot. How you get it: It comes in one dose, given by your doctor. Now, the number of people with chickenpox is at an all-time low in the U.S. Who should get the vaccine: If it wasn't around when you were a child, you should think about getting it, especially if you: Work in health care Work or live with children Are in college Work in a jail or prison Are in the military Are of childbearing age Travel to other countries Who shouldn't get it: If you're pregnant, wait until one month after your baby's born.

You need treatment from a dentist or endodontist -- a specialist who can help save your tooth. If you don't treat it, the infection can spread beyond your jaw to your neck, head, or other body parts. Your tooth is hard on the outside, but the inside is filled with a pulp made up of nerves, connective tissue, and blood vessels. Most often that results from: A deep cavity or tooth decay Gum disease, also known as periodontal disease A cracked tooth If you don't treat the infection, it can kill the pulp and lead to an abscess. There are two common types: A periapical abscess forms at the tip of your tooth's root. A periodontal abscess affects the bone next to your tooth. You might notice: Pain Swelling Gum redness Bad taste Pain when you chew Jaw pain Fever Swollen lymph nodes Trouble breathing or swallowing Sometimes an abscess causes a pimple-like bump on your gum. If you press it and liquid oozes out, it's a sure bet you have an abscessed tooth. While pain and swelling are common signs, you may not have any symptoms. If you don't have symptoms, your dentist could spot an abscess through X-rays at a routine exam. If he can't diagnose the abscess on his own, he'll probably send you to an endodontist, who's specially trained to work on abscessed teeth. To do that, the endodontist may try: Antibiotics: If the infection has spread past the abscess site to your jaw or farther into your body, you'll probably get them. Root canal: You may have heard about this common way to treat an abscess. You'll either get a filling or a crown. Surgery: You may need it to drain a periodontal abscess. Keep in mind, if an abscess ruptures, your pain will ease but you'll still need treatment from a dentist or endodontist. Take these simple steps to keep your teeth and gums healthy: Get regular dental checkups and teeth cleanings. Floss daily to clean hard-to-reach spots between your teeth and gums. Make a dentist appointment as soon as possible if you have a loose or cracked tooth.

Doctors aren't sure what causes it, but some things can raise your risk. Common risk factors for placenta abruptio include: High blood pressure (140/90 or higher). This is the biggest risk factor for placenta abruptio, whether the high blood pressure is a long-term problem or is caused by the pregnancy (preeclampsia). Less common risk factors include: Using cocaine. Having a scar from a past surgery or a uterine fibroid where the placenta has attached to the wall of the uterus. This could occur because of a car accident, a fall, or physical abuse. Premature rupture of membranes for 24 hours or more, especially when there is an infection in the uterus. If you have placenta abruptio, you may notice one or more warning signs. Call your doctor right away if you are pregnant and you: Have light to moderate bleeding from your vagina. It might also feel hard or rigid. These include regular contractions and aches or pains in your lower back or belly. Call or emergency services right away if you have: Sudden or severe pain in your belly. Severe vaginal bleeding, such as a gush of blood or passing a clot. These include feeling lightheaded or like you are going faint; feeling confused, restless, or weak; feeling sick to your stomach or vomiting; and having fast, shallow breathing. In rare cases, symptoms of shock are the only signs of a serious problem. This is to assess your baby's condition and check for contractions of the uterus. You can become anemic from heavy blood loss. If placenta abruptio is suspected, you'll probably need to be in the hospital until your doctor finds out how severe it is. If you have mild placenta abruptio and your baby is not in distress, you may not have to stay in the hospital. You and your baby will be checked often throughout the rest of your pregnancy. If you are in preterm labor and are far from your due date, you may be given medicine to stop labor. If you have moderate to severe placenta abruptio, you will probably have to stay in the hospital so your baby's health can be watched closely. In most cases, the baby will need to be delivered quickly. This means you are likely to have a C-section (cesarean delivery). If you have lost a lot of blood, you may need a blood transfusion. If your baby is premature, he or she may be treated in a neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU. The NICU is geared to the needs of premature or ill newborns. There is no sure way to prevent placenta abruptio, but you can do things to lower your risk. Your risk is much higher than normal if you have had placenta abruptio before, so these steps are very important. If you have high blood pressure, follow your doctor's treatment advice. Don't use illegal drugs, like cocaine and meth. Get regular prenatal checkups throughout your pregnancy."], [1388, "Abortion", "This topic is about ending a pregnancy. If you have had unprotected sex in the last 5 days and don't want to become pregnant, see the topic Emergency Contraception. Abortion is the early ending of a pregnancy. But women can also choose to end a pregnancy by getting surgery or taking medicine. If you think you might be pregnant, see a doctor as soon as possible. The earlier you are in your pregnancy, the more options you are likely to have. Your doctor will ask about your medical history and will do a physical exam. You will have lab tests to make sure that you are pregnant. It's not easy to decide to end a pregnancy. Counseling may help you to decide what is best for you. You may also want to talk with someone close to you who understands how pregnancy and raising a child would affect your life. Carefully think through your choices, which are to: Have a baby, and support and raise your child to adulthood. Have a baby, and place the baby for adoption. You may have a choice between a medical abortion (which means taking medicine to end the pregnancy) and a surgical abortion such as vacuum aspiration or dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E). After 9 weeks, surgical abortion is usually the only option. The risks from having an abortion in the second trimester are higher than in the first trimester. Abortions done early in the pregnancy can be done by your doctor or gynecologist. Some nurse-midwives, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants may also be trained to do some types of abortions. Abortion services are most likely to be offered at university hospitals and family planning clinics. Some states in the U.S. have legal restrictions on abortion. Abortions are rarely done after 24 weeks of pregnancy (during the late second trimester and entire third trimester). Less than 1 out of 100 women have a serious problem from an abortion.1 The safest timing for an abortion is usually during the first trimester. This is when a low-risk medicine or vacuum aspiration procedure can be used. The most widely used methods for abortion do not prevent a woman from becoming pregnant later. Keep in mind that you can get pregnant in the weeks right after an abortion. It will probably take you 1 to 3 weeks to heal and feel better after an abortion. But when you do have sex again, be sure to use a condom for several weeks or for as long as your doctor tells you to."], [1389, "Abnormal Pap Test", "A Pap test, also called a Pap smear, is an exam a doctor uses to test for cervical cancer in women. It can also reveal changes in your cervical cells that may turn into cancer later. You'll spread your legs, and your doctor will insert a metal or plastic tool (speculum) into your vagina. Your doctor will use a swab to take a sample of cells from your cervix. The Pap test doesn't hurt, but you may feel a little pinch or a bit of pressure. That means your doctor didn't find any strange-looking cells on your cervix. If your results come back positive, it doesn't mean you have cancer. Or, you might have minor cell changes (doctors call this \"dysplasia\"). These often clear up on their own, so your doctor may take a \"wait and see\" approach. He'll likely suggest you have another Pap test in a few months. If the abnormal cells haven't cleared up by then, your doctor may order more tests. During a colposcopy, your doctor will insert a speculum into your vagina, just like he did for the Pap test. That's a tool that has a lens and a bright light that allow your doctor to get a better look at your cervix. Your doctor will swab your cervix with vinegar or some other liquid solution. Doctors recommend you begin Pap testing at age 21. If you're age 30 or over, you can have a Pap test every 5 years if you're tested at the same time for the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). That's the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI), and it's linked to cervical cancer. If you have certain health concerns, your doctor may recommend you have a Pap more often. Some of these include: Cervical cancer or a Pap test that revealed pre-cancerous cells HIV infection A weakened immune system due to organ transplant, chemotherapy, or chronic corticosteroid use Having been exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) before birth Talk to your doctor if you have questions or concerns."], [1390, "Ablepharon Macrostomia Syndrome", "Ablepharon-Macrostomia Syndrome (AMS) is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by various physical abnormalities affecting the head and facial (craniofacial) area, the skin, the fingers, and the genitals. In infants with Ablepharon-Macrostomia Syndrome, characteristic craniofacial features may include absence or severe underdevelopment of the upper and lower eyelids (ablepharon or microblepharon) as well as absence of eyelashes and eyebrows; an unusually wide, \"fish-like\" mouth (macrostomia); and/or incompletely developed (rudimentary), low-set ears (pinnae). Individuals with AMS may also have additional characteristic features including abnormally sparse, thin hair; thin, wrinkled skin with excess (redundant) folds; webbed fingers with limited extension; and/or malformations of the external genitals. In some cases, additional features associated with AMS may include absent or abnormally small (hypoplastic) nipples and/or abdominal wall abnormalities."], [1391, "Aase Syndrome", "Aase syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that may be detected during early infancy. The disorder is primarily characterized by the presence of three bones (phalanges) within the thumbs (triphalangeal thumbs) rather than the normal two and abnormally reduced production of red blood cells (hypoplastic anemia). However, most evidence suggests that the disorder is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait."], [1392, "Burns", "It is common to get a minor burn from hot water, a curling iron, or touching a hot stove. Heat burns (thermal burns) are caused by fire, steam, hot objects, or hot liquids. Scald burns from hot liquids are the most common burns to children and older adults. Cold temperature burns are caused by skin exposure to wet, windy, or cold conditions. Chemical burns are caused by contact with household or industrial chemicals in a liquid, solid, or gas form. Natural foods such as chili peppers, which contain a substance irritating to the skin, can cause a burning sensation. Radiation burns are caused by the sun, tanning booths, sunlamps, X-rays, or radiation therapy for cancer treatment. Athletes who fall on floors, courts, or tracks may get friction burns to the skin. Burns injure the skin layers and can also injure other parts of the body, such as muscles, blood vessels, nerves, lungs, and eyes. Burns are defined as first-, second-, third-, or fourth-degree, depending on how many layers of skin and tissue are burned. The deeper the burn and the larger the burned area, the more serious the burn is. First-degree burns are burns of the first layer of skin . Superficial partial-thickness burns injure the first and second layers of skin. Fourth-degree burns extend through the skin to injure muscle, ligaments, tendons, nerves, blood vessels, and bones. The seriousness of a burn is determined by several things, including: The depth, size, cause, affected body area, age, and health of the burn victim. Older adults are at a higher risk for burns, mostly scald burns from hot liquids. Babies and young children may have a more severe reaction from a burn than an adult. A burn in an adult may cause a minor loss of fluids from the body, but in a baby or young child, the same size and depth of a burn may cause a severe fluid loss. A child's age determines how safe his or her environment needs to be, as well as how much the child needs to be supervised. At each stage of a child's life, look for burn hazards and use appropriate safety measures. Since most burns happen in the home, simple safety measures decrease the chance of anyone getting burned. When a child or vulnerable adult is burned, it is important to find out how the burn happened. If the reported cause of the burn does not match how the burn looks, abuse must be considered and resources for help, such as social services, offered. Self-inflicted burns will require treatment as well as an evaluation of the person's emotional health. Home treatment for a minor burn will reduce the risk of infection."], [1393, "Bunions", "If you're like many people, your big toe may lean slightly toward your other toes. Over time, the base of the big toe pushes outward against the first metatarsal bone, which is directly behind it. T he result is a bunion -- a bony, often painful hump at the base of the big toe. But when you have a bunion, all of your body weight rests on it each time you take a step. And, because your shoe likely rubs against it, a bunion can also cause calluses to form. They may be just one of many problems caused by weak or poor foot structure. If one of your legs is longer than the other, you may develop a bunion on the big toe of the longer one. See where the bottom of your big toe connects to it? If you see a bony bump there with your big toe headed in the opposite direction, you probably have a bunion. It may sometimes swell, turn red, feel tender to the touch, or even hurt. Over time, it may also become shiny and feel warm when you touch it. If you have pain when you're walking in flat shoes that should feel comfortable, make an appointment with a podiatrist (a foot specialist)."], [1394, "Bullying", "Bullying is acting in ways that scare or harm another person. Kids who bully usually pick on someone who is weaker or more alone, and they repeat the actions over and over. Bullying starts in elementary school and becomes most common in middle school. By high school, it is less common but still occurs. Bullying can take many forms, including: Physical harm, such as hitting, shoving, or tripping. Emotional harm, such as making fun of the way a child acts, looks, or talks. Writing mean things about someone in emails or online journals (blogs) is also bullying. Girls who bully are more likely to do so in emotional ways. Boys who bully often do so in both physical and emotional ways. For example: A girl may form a group and exclude another girl or gossip about her. Emotional bullying doesn't leave bruises, but the damage is just as real. If you think your child is being bullied-or is bullying someone else-take action to stop the abuse. Bullying is a serious problem for all children involved. They may fear or lose interest in going to school. Sometimes they take extreme measures, which can lead to tragic results. They may carry weapons, use violence to get revenge, or try to harm themselves. Kids who bully others are more likely to drop out of school, have drug and alcohol problems, and break the law. Say, \"Leave me alone,\" or \"You don't scare me.\" Have your child practice saying this in a calm, strong voice. A parent or teacher can then take steps to stop the bullying. Bullying can be stopped if people pay attention and take action. Bullying most often occurs in school, and it is most common in schools where students are not well supervised. If bullying is happening at your child's school, talk to the principal or vice principal. As a parent, you can help your child get involved in new hobbies or groups, such as school clubs or church youth groups. Being part of a group can help reduce bullying. Kids can help keep other kids from being bullied. Speak up when you see someone else being picked on. It can help to say something like, \"Cut it out. If this is too hard or scary to do, walk away and tell an adult. If someone sends you a mean email about another person, don't forward it to others."], [1395, "Buchanan's Syndrome", "Truncus arteriosus is a rare type of heart disease that is present at birth (congenital) in which there is a single main blood vessel, rather than the normal two, carrying blood away from the heart. Instead of having a separate pulmonary artery, to carry blood to the lungs, and aorta, to carry blood to the rest of the body, a baby with truncus arteriosus has just one blood vessel leaving the heart which then branches into other blood vessels. Blood from both ventricles of the heart is mixed, resulting in a situation in which some oxygen-rich blood travels needlessly back to the lungs and some oxygen-poor blood travels to the rest of the body."], [1396, "Briquet's Syndrome", "Conversion disorder is a mental illness characterized by the loss or alteration of physical functioning without any physiological reason. A lack of concern over the debilitating symptoms (la belle indifference), which commonly accompanies this illness, may be a clue to distinguishing it from the physiological disorder it may mimic."], [1397, "Breech Position and Breech Birth", "During most of pregnancy, there is enough room in the uterus for the baby (fetus) to change position. Instead, the baby is in a breech position.1 Babies in breech position usually must be delivered by C-section. In some cases, breech position may be linked to early labor, twins or more, problems with the uterus, or problems with the baby.2 You probably won't be able to feel whether your baby is breech. But if you are 36 or more weeks pregnant and think you feel the baby's head pressing high up in your belly or you feel kicking in your lower belly, see your doctor for an exam. During a routine exam late in your pregnancy, your doctor will feel your upper and lower belly and may do a fetal ultrasound to find out if your baby is breech. Your doctor may also learn that your baby is breech when he or she checks your cervix. (If you are using a midwife and your baby is in breech position, your midwife will refer you to a doctor for this procedure.) If the baby can be turned head-down before labor starts, you may be able to have a vaginal birth. You also can ask your doctor if you can try certain positions at home that may help turn your baby. It's normal to feel disappointed and worried about a breech pregnancy, especially if the doctor has tried to turn the baby without success. But most breech babies are healthy and don't have problems after birth. In most cases, a planned cesarean delivery (C-section) is safest for the baby. If your fetus is still in a breech position near your due date, your doctor will likely schedule a cesarean. If you are using a midwife, your midwife will refer you to a doctor for a scheduled C-section. In rare cases, a cesarean breech birth may not be recommended or even possible. For instance, if a breech labor progresses too quickly, a vaginal birth may be the only option. During a twin birth in which the first twin is head-down and the second twin is breech, both babies may best be delivered vaginally.3 No matter what position a baby is in, every labor and delivery is unique. Even though you and your doctor have a birth plan for labor and delivery, plans can change. If something unexpected happens, your doctor may need to make some quick decisions to keep you and your baby safe."], [1398, "Breath-Holding Spells", "Breath-holding spells usually occur when a young child is angry, frustrated, in pain, or afraid. There are two types of breath-holding spells: A cyanotic spell is caused by a change in the child's usual breathing pattern, usually in response to feeling angry or frustrated. A pallid spell is caused by a slowing of the child's heart rate, usually in response to pain. Some children may have both types of spells at one time or another. Breath-holding spells are usually caused by either a change in the child's breathing or a slowing of the heart rate. These reactions may be brought on by pain or by strong emotions. In some children, breath-holding spells may be related to iron deficiency anemia, a condition in which the body doesn't produce a normal number of red blood cells.

In a cyanotic spell: There may be a short burst of intense crying. In a pallid spell: There may be a single cry or no cry at all. It may help for you to keep a record of what happens during each spell. If your doctor thinks that your child has a seizure disorder or another condition, such as iron deficiency anemia, your child may need other tests. If your doctor thinks that a medical condition is causing the spells, your child may need treatment. To decrease the chance of more spells, make sure that your child gets plenty of rest, and try to help your child feel secure. If you have trouble dealing with your child's spells or find yourself getting angry, talk with your doctor or a counselor. To protect your child during a spell, lay your child on the floor and keep his or her arms, legs, and head from hitting anything hard or sharp. Your child may stop breathing for up to 1 minute (60 seconds) during a spell. If your child doesn't wake up quickly and start breathing again, call or other emergency services."], [1399, "Breast Reconstruction", "If you've have a mastectomy because of breast cancer, you may choose to have reconstructive plastic surgery. It can restore symmetry between the two breasts by replacing skin, breast tissue, and the removed nipple. The amount of reconstruction will depend on the mastectomy, and the width, size, and location of the removed tumor. The long-term prospects of living without a breast or part of one affects every woman differently. You can wear external breast forms or pads, or make no attempt to change your appearance. You can choose breast reconstruction using either breast implants or your own tissue. Since it's considered part of the treatment of a disease, the law says insurance providers must provide coverage. The timing is based on your desires, medical conditions, and cancer treatment. You can choose to have it done during the same operation to remove the breast, or months or years after a mastectomy. If you've started any chemotherapy or radiation treatments, reconstruction is usually postponed until you complete those treatments. You and your doctor will need to talk about your wants and needs, your medical condition, and any previous surgery before you decide. Implants involve stretching the skin with a tissue expander that goes inside you, and then inserting a silicone-gel or saline (salt water) implant weeks later. The tissue expander is filled to a desired volume by adding saline, usually once a week for a few sessions. Many women find these sessions painful, but they're often pleased with the final result. Tissue flap procedures use a woman's own tissue taken from the abdomen or back (or sometimes the thighs and bottom) to create a mound to reconstruct the breast. Taking abdominal tissue is called a TRAM flap. Taking tissue from the back is called a latissimus dorsi flap. Other times it's disconnected and then reconnected to a blood supply near the new location. Usually, the nipple and areola (the dark area around the nipple) are removed during the mastectomy to lower the chance of cancer returning. This allows the new tissue to heal and settle into place. Surgeons can make a nipple from tissue taken from the back or abdominal flap. In rare cases, the nipple from the original breast can be reattached, but only if the surgeon is convinced the tissue is cancer-free. Because of a lack of nerve connections, the nipple will not rise or flatten in response to touch or temperature. The plastic surgeon makes a copy of your natural nipple and colors the areola. After the surgery, you'll spend about 2 to 3 hours in recovery before being transferred to a hospital room. The day after surgery, you may be able to sit in a chair beside the bed. You'll likely get IV fluids for a day or two. You may have a urinary catheter in overnight or until you can walk to the bathroom. If you go home with these drains in place, you'll get instructions on how to care for them. The length of your hospital stay depends on the type of operation and how your recovery goes. If you got implants, the average hospital stay is 1 to 2 days. After you go home, you can expect some soreness, swelling, and bruising for 2 to 3 weeks. You may be asked to apply medications to the suture area or change bandages at home. Your plastic surgeon will advise you about showering, bathing, and wound care. Instead of feeling pain where the tissue was taken, you may feel numbness and tightness. If you have a temporary expander implanted, it will be expanded with saline once a week, on average, until the desired size is reached (usually within six to 10 office visits). Breast reconstruction doesn't change the chance of cancer coming back, and it generally doesn't interfere with treatment. If the disease does come back, your medical team can still treat you with surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy."], [1400, "Breast Problems", "Breast lumps come in many forms, including cysts, adenomas, and papillomas. Most lumps are benign and do not signal cancer; however, any time you find a new or unusual lump, have your doctor check it to make sure it is not precancerous or cancerous. Researchers are studying the incidence of breast lumps in women using hormone replacement therapy (HRT). In combination HRT, women take the hormones estrogen and progestin to ease the symptoms of menopause. In 2002, a study called the Women's Health Initiative discovered that HRT resulted in more harm than good. Taking both hormones was shown to increase the risk of breast cancer and change the breast's structure, increasing breast density and making mammograms harder to read. To put this into numbers, if 10,000 women took combined HRT for a year, this would add up to about 8 more cases of breast cancer per year than if they had not taken hormone therapy (HT). Fibroadenomas are the most common benign breast tumors in women under 25 and occasionally in adolescents. Your doctor may recommend removal if the lump persists, gets larger, or if you are anxious about it. They vary in appearance, sometimes come back after being removed, and are sometimes associated with cancer. Usually seen in women over 40, papillomas produce a discharge, which may be bloody. You should discuss breast self-exams with your doctor, and your doctor should go over how to perform them with you. Premenstrual changes can cause temporary thickening in breast tissue that disappears after your period, so your doctor may tell you to wait until a few days after your period to do them. A breast self-exam is easiest in the shower, using soap to smooth your skin. Using light pressure, check for lumps near the surface. Any time you find a new or unusual lump in your breast, have your doctor check it to make sure it is not cancer. Mammograms -- detailed X-ray pictures of the breasts -- can reveal tumors too tiny to be felt by hand. There is disagreement as to when a woman should start getting mammograms: Some doctors say between ages 35 and 40; others say not until age 50. The National Cancer Institute recommends a mammogram every 1 to 2 years, starting at 40. The USPSTF recommends routine screening for women starting at 50. If you have a family history of breast cancer, especially in your mother or sister, your doctor may want you to start them earlier. Breast pain can have many causes, including the normal swelling of breast tissue during the menstrual cycle. Other causes include infection or injury; growths, including cancer; and perhaps diet. The general swelling of breast tissue with your period can be painful, but it is not dangerous, and no treatment is necessary if you can tolerate the discomfort. Each monthly cycle brings about changes in hormones, including more estrogen and progesterone, that bring more fluid into the breasts, expanding tissue, stretching nerve fibers, and causing pain. Some women have this painful swelling just before their periods, with symptoms easing near the end of the menstrual flow. Trauma and infection in the breast have the same symptoms you would see elsewhere in your body. Infections tend to become walled off from surrounding tissue, producing small abscesses. Cysts may produce pain, but breast cancer rarely does -- although pain does not rule out the possibility of cancer."], [1401, "Breast Pain (Mastalgia)", "Many women have breast tenderness and pain, also called mastalgia. It may come and go with monthly periods (cyclic) or may not follow any pattern (noncyclic). Cyclic pain is the most common type of breast pain. It is generally described as a heaviness or soreness that radiates to the armpit and arm. Cyclic breast pain occurs more often in younger women. It is often described as a sharp, burning pain that occurs in one area of a breast. Occasionally, noncyclic pain may be caused by a fibroadenoma or a cyst. If the cause of noncyclic pain can be found, treating the cause may relieve the pain. Breast pain can get worse with changes in your hormone levels or changes in the medicines you are taking. You may be able to relieve breast pain by using nonprescription medicines. Acetaminophen, such as Tylenol Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin), naproxen (Aleve or Naprosyn), or aspirin (Anacin, Bayer) If breast pain becomes severe or lasts longer than 3 weeks, call your doctor to discuss your symptoms. If you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant, talk to your doctor before using any medicine. Danazol and tamoxifen citrate are prescription medicines used for the treatment of severe cyclic breast pain. You may also be able to relieve breast pain by: Using birth control pills (oral contraceptives). These may help reduce cyclic breast pain and breast swelling before periods. But breast pain is also a known side effect of birth control pills. Magnesium supplements taken in the second half of the menstrual cycle (usually the 2 weeks before the next period) relieve cyclic breast pain as well as other premenstrual symptoms. You may be able to prevent breast pain, tenderness, or discomfort by wearing a sports bra during exercise. It should keep the breasts almost motionless and allow them to move together with the chest, not separately. It is important to replace your sports bra as the material stretches and become less supportive."], [1402, "Breast Engorgement", "Breast engorgement means your breasts are painfully overfull of milk. Your breasts may become firm and swollen, which can make it hard for your baby to breastfeed. Engorged breasts can be treated at home. Engorgement may happen: When your milk first comes in, during the first few days after birth. Your breasts start making milk about 2 to 5 days after your baby is born. It's normal for your breasts to feel heavy, warm, and swollen when your milk \"comes in.\" This early breast fullness is from the milk you make and extra blood and fluids in your breasts. Your body uses the extra fluids to make more breast milk for your baby. This normal breast fullness will probably go away in a few days as you breastfeed and your body adjusts to your baby's needs. Your breasts may become painfully engorged if you aren't breastfeeding your baby often or if the feedings don't empty your breasts. Your breasts will be engorged for several days if you don't or can't breastfeed after your baby is born. This will gradually go away if your breasts are not stimulated to make milk. At present, there is no approved medicine to \"dry up\" your milk supply and prevent engorgement. Symptoms of engorged breasts include: Swollen, firm, and painful breasts. If the breasts are severely engorged, they are very swollen, hard, shiny, warm, and slightly lumpy to the touch. If engorgement is severe, your breasts get very swollen and painful. Severe engorgement can make it hard for your baby to latch on to the breast properly. Your breasts may not empty completely. This may cause you to breastfeed less, and that makes the engorgement worse. Severe engorgement can lead to blocked milk ducts and breast infection, which is called mastitis. They can relieve your symptoms and keep your milk flowing. Or you can use your hands or use a pump to let out (express) a small amount of milk from both breasts. Pump your breasts if your baby won't breastfeed. Take care to empty your breasts each time. Take ibuprofen (such as Advil or Motrin) to reduce pain and swelling. But it's a good idea to check with your doctor before you take any kind of medicine while breastfeeding. Apply it to your breasts for 15 minutes at a time every hour as needed. To prevent damage to your skin, place a thin cloth between your breast and the cold pack. If you are not breastfeeding, use one or more of these steps to relieve discomfort: Do not pump or remove a lot of milk from your breasts. If your breasts are very painful, it's okay to remove just a little bit to make you more comfortable. Apply a cold pack to your breasts for 15 minutes at a time every hour as needed. To prevent damage to your skin, place a thin cloth between your breast and the cold pack. You may be able to prevent engorgement if you keep milk moving out of your breasts and take care not to let your breasts become overfilled. If your breasts are hard and overfilled, let out (express) enough to soften your nipples before putting your baby to the breast. Empty one breast completely before you switch to the other side."], [1403, "Breast Cancer: Treatment", "Breast cancer treatments are getting better all the time, and people have many more options today than ever before. No matter which ones you choose, all breast cancer treatments have two main goals: To rid the body of as much of the cancer as possible To prevent the disease from coming back Your doctor will think about a few things before she recommends a treatment for you: The type of breast cancer you have The size of your tumor and how far the cancer has spread in your body, called the stage of your disease If your tumor has things called \"receptors\" for HER2 protein, estrogen, and progesterone, or other specific features. Your age, if you've gone through menopause, other health conditions you have, and your personal preferences also play a role in this decision-making process. Some treatments remove or destroy the disease within the breast and nearby tissues, such as lymph nodes. These include: Surgery to remove the whole breast, called a mastectomy, or to remove just the tumor and tissues around it, called a lumpectomy or breast-conserving surgery. Other treatments destroy or control cancer cells all over the body: Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. As these powerful medicines fight the disease, they also can cause side effects, like nausea, hair loss, early menopause, hot flashes, and fatigue. Hormone therapy uses drugs to prevent hormones, especially estrogen, from fueling the growth of breast cancer cells. Medicines include tamoxifen (Nolvadex, Soltamox) for women before and after menopause and aromatase inhibitors including anastrozole (Arimidex), exemestane (Aromasin), and letrozole (Femara) for postmenopausal women. Some types of this therapy work by stopping the ovaries from making hormones, either through surgery or medication. They target breast cancer cells that have high levels of a protein called HER2. Along with an aromatase inhibitor, palbociclib and ribociclib are for postmenopausal women with certain types of advanced cancer. Talk with your doctor about all the risks and benefits of each treatment option and how they will affect your lifestyle. Other people with breast cancer know what you're going through and can give you advice and understanding. Ask your doctor if you should join a clinical trial, a research study that tests new treatments before they're available to everyone."], [1404, "Breast Cancer: Screening", "When it comes to breast cancer screening and detection, experts and advocacy groups don't agree on when women should start getting regular breast cancer screening mammograms. Without delving into the controversy, consider these facts: The lifetime risk (to age 85) of a woman developing breast cancer in 1940 was 5% or one in 20; the risk is now 13.4%, or greater than one in 8. Women who undergo breast cancer screening mammograms have demonstrated significantly reduced deaths from the disease. The effectiveness of any breast cancer screening program will depend on how often women are screened, compliance with screening recommendations, and the quality of the screening test. The following are American Cancer Society recommendations for breast cancer screening: Breast exam by a health care provider is recommended by some expert groups every 1-3 years starting at age 20 and annually beginning at age 40. Annual screening mammography starting at age 45; breast cancer experts don't all agree. Women in high-risk categories should have screening mammograms every year and typically start at an earlier age."], [1405, "Breast Cancer, Metastatic or Recurrent", "This topic provides information about breast cancer that has spread or come back after treatment. If you are looking for information about first-time diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, see the topic Breast Cancer. Breast cancer occurs when abnormal cells grow out of control in one or both breasts. Metastatic breast cancer means that cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Recurrent breast cancer means that cancer has come back in or near the original site or in another part of the body. For most women who have had breast cancer, their greatest fear is that the cancer will come back or spread. Other recurrent breast cancers and metastatic breast cancer usually can't be cured. Even with the best treatment, cancer can come back. If just a few cancer cells remain in your body after your initial treatment, those cells can spread through the blood or lymph system and grow. This may happen from a few months to many years after the first diagnosis. If your breast cancer has come back, you may second-guess your previous treatment choices. Now it is time to make new decisions and explore other treatment options. The most common places for breast cancer to spread are within the breast or to the nearby chest wall or to the liver, lungs, or bones. Common symptoms include a lump in your breast or on your chest wall, bone pain, and shortness of breath. To plan your treatment, your doctor will consider where the cancer is and what type of treatment you had in the past. Treatment choices may include surgery, medicines like chemotherapy or hormone therapy, and radiation. Treatments for breast cancer can cause side effects. Your doctor can tell you what problems to expect and help you find ways to manage them. Your doctor may recommend that you join a clinical trial if one is available in your area. Clinical trials test new cancer treatments and may be the best choice for you. If treatments don't work, a time may come when the goal of your treatment shifts from trying to cure your cancer to keeping you as comfortable as possible. This can allow you to make the most of the time you have left. It may be hard to stay hopeful when you are fighting cancer for the second or third time. These ideas may help: Get the support you need. Spend time with people who care about you, and let them help you. Find a support group where you can share your experience. If your emotions are too much to handle, be sure to tell your doctor. You may be able to get counseling or other types of help. You may want to think about planning for the future. A living will lets doctors know what type of life-support measures you want if your health gets much worse. You can also choose a health care agent to make decisions in case you aren't able to. If you put your wishes in writing, you can make it easier for your loved ones and others to know what you want. What are the types of breast cancer?"], [1406, "Breast Cancer Risk Factors", "In 1940, the lifetime risk of a woman developing breast cancer was 5%, or one in 20. In fact, about half of all women with breast cancer have no known risk factors. A risk factor is anything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease. Different cancers have different risk factors. However, having a cancer risk factor, or even several of them, does not necessarily mean that a person will get cancer. Some women with one or more breast cancer risk factors never develop breast cancer, while about half of women with breast cancer have no apparent risk factors. A woman with a history of cancer in one breast, such as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive breast cancer, is three to four times likelier to develop a new breast cancer, unrelated to the first one, in either the other breast or in another part of the same breast. Your risk for breast cancer increases as you age. About 77% of women diagnosed with breast cancer each year are over age 50, and almost 50% are ages 65 and older. Consider this: In women ages 40 to 50, there is a one in 68 risk of developing breast cancer. From ages 50 to 60, that risk increases to one in 42. Having a mother, sister, or daughter (\"first-degree\" relative) who has breast cancer puts a woman at higher risk for the disease. Having one first-degree relative with breast cancer approximately doubles a woman's risk, and having two first-degree relatives triples her risk.Having a male blood relative with breast cancer will also increase a woman's risk of the disease. About 5% to 10% of breast cancer cases are thought to be hereditary. Carriers of alterations in either of two familial breast cancer genes called BRCA1 or BRCA2 are at higher risk. Women with an inherited alteration in the BRCA1 gene have a 55%-%65 chance of developing breast cancer during her lifetime, and those with an inherited alteration in the BRCA2 gene have up to a 45% chance of developing breast cancer. A previous breast biopsy result of atypical hyperplasia (lobular or ductal) or lobular carcinoma in situ increases a woman's breast cancer risk by four to five times. This refers to breast cancer in second- or third-degree relatives such as aunts, grandmothers, and cousins. Women with earlier biopsies showing any of the following have a slight increased risk: fibroadenomas with complex features, hyperplasia without atypia, sclerosing adenosis, and solitary papilloma. Longer lifetime exposure to endogenous (your own) estrogen increases your risk, such as starting to menstruate before age 12, starting menopause after age 55, and never having had a pregnancy. Being overweight (especially in the waist), with excess caloric and fat intake, increases your risk, especially after menopause. Female descendents of Eastern and Central European Jews (Ashkenazi) are at increased risk. Use of alcohol is linked to increased risk of developing breast cancer. Compared with nondrinkers, women who consume one alcoholic drink a day have a very small increase in risk, and those who have 2 to 5 drinks daily have about 1.5 times the risk of women who do not drink. Caucasian women are at a slightly higher risk of developing breast cancer than are African-American, Asian, Hispanic, and Native American women. The exception to this is African-American women, who are more likely than Caucasians to have breast cancer under age 40. Long-term use of combined estrogen and progesterone increases the risk of breast cancer. Having a pregnancy before age 18, starting menopause early, and having the ovaries removed before age 37 decreases the risk of developing breast cancer. Factors not related to breast cancer Fibrocystic breast changes Multiple pregnancies Coffee or caffeine intake Use of anti-perspirants Wearing underwire bras Using hair dye Having an abortion or miscarriage Using breast implants Scientists are still investigating whether smoking, high-fat diets, lack of exercise, and environmental pollution increase breast cancer risk. Some studies have suggested that women who are using birth control pills have a very slight increased risk of developing breast cancer. Women who breastfeed have a reduced risk of breast cancer."], [1407, "Breast Cancer in Men", "The \"breasts\" of an adult man are similar to the breasts of a girl before puberty. Men get the same types of breast cancers that women do, but cancers involving the parts that make and store milk are rare. Doctors used to think that breast cancer in men was more severe than it was in women, but it now seems that it's about the same. The major problem is that breast cancer in men is often diagnosed later than breast cancer in women. It's rare for a man under age 35 to get breast cancer. Other things that raise the odds for male breast cancer include: Breast cancer in a close female relative History of radiation exposure of the chest Enlargement of breasts (called gynecomastia) from drug or hormone treatments, or even some infections and poisons Taking estrogen A rare genetic condition called Klinefelter's syndrome Severe liver disease, called cirrhosis Diseases of the testicles such as mumps orchitis, a testicular injury, or an undescended testicle Symptoms of breast cancer in men are similar to those in women. But unlike women, men tend to delay going to the doctor until they have more severe symptoms, like bleeding from the nipple. The same techniques that are used to diagnose breast cancer in women are used in men: physical exams, mammography, and biopsies (examining small samples of tissue under a microscope). Likewise, the same treatments that are used in treating breast cancer in women -- surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, biological therapy, and hormone therapy -- are also used to treat breast cancer in men. The one major difference is that men with breast cancer respond much better to hormone therapy than women do. About 90% of male breast cancers have hormone receptors, meaning that hormone therapy can work in most men to treat the cancer."], [1408, "Breast Cancer and Your Genes", "Women with a family history of breast cancer make up about 5% to 10% of all women with the disease. Having a close relative (mother, sister, or daughter) with breast cancer doubles your risk compared to that of other women. If any of the following are true for you, there's an increased likelihood you carry a breast cancer gene: You were diagnosed with breast cancer before age 45. You have several family members diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer. You were diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer (cancer in both breasts). You were diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer before the age of 60. If you inherit a mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2, you're more likely to develop cancer during your lifetime. Women who inherit the mutated BRCA1 gene have a 55% to 65% risk of developing breast cancer by age 70. Women with the mutated BRCA2 have around a 45% risk. Either mutation brings an increased risk of developing breast cancer at a younger age (before menopause). People who have the mutated BRCA1 gene have an increased risk of breast cancer recurrence. Bilateral breast cancer (cancer in both breasts) is also common in women who carry the mutated BRCA1. Both mutations also increase your risk of other cancers, especially ovarian cancer. At-risk families can take blood tests to screen for mutations in these genes. The screening can also help determine if a woman who has already been diagnosed with breast cancer is at an increased risk for a second breast cancer or ovarian cancer."], [1409, "Breast Cancer and Pregnancy", "It doesn't happen often, but sometimes mothers-to-be have breast cancer. Getting pregnant doesn't cause the cancer, although the changes in hormones from the pregnancy can make the disease grow faster. Your breasts thicken while you're expecting, and that can make it hard to spot small masses or lumps. Because of this, breast cancer tumors are often larger and more advanced by the time they're noticed. Any lumps or suspicious symptoms need to be checked by a doctor. These visits are called prenatal (or \"before birth\") checkups, and they're crucial for keeping you and your baby in the best possible health. If you're not sure exactly how to give yourself a breast exam, your doctor or nurse can teach you. A mammogram is considered fairly safe during pregnancy, but it may not be as helpful because of the increased density of the breasts. If a suspicious lump is found, your doctor should do a biopsy. She'll remove a small sample of the suspicious tissue with a needle or by making a small cut. Surgery, in general, is safe during any trimester of pregnancy. If the cancer is still in its early stages, your doctor will most likely recommend removing either the suspicious lump (lumpectomy) or the entire breast (mastectomy). Lumpectomy is usually an option for women diagnosed in the third trimester. During breast cancer surgery, the surgeon will examine the lymph nodes to see whether any are affected. If you need chemotherapy, your doctor will usually wait until after the first trimester to lessen the chance that it will harm the baby. Advanced breast cancer usually requires both surgery and chemotherapy, so the risk for the baby is higher. There's no evidence that stopping your flow of breast milk will improve your cancer. It's often okay to breastfeed when you have this disease, but talk with your doctor or a lactation counselor to see what's best for you and your baby."], [1410, "Bulimia Nervosa (Sensitive Topic) References", "Gwirtsman HE, et al., (2008).

Dialectical behavior therapy, which is a long-term approach that focuses on helping the person regulate emotions. Group counseling, which may enhance individual therapy. Family members can be very helpful to their loved one's recovery, especially for an adolescent with bulimia. Family therapy teaches about the disorder and ways to help. Organized programs that provide self-help materials, such as manuals or computer-based activities, may be useful in treating eating disorders. But most people who have an eating disorder also need counseling and possibly medicine. Although it isn't part of the treatment of bulimia, relieving stress can help during recovery. Expressing yourself in writing can be a very effective way to reduce your stress level. Talking, laughing, crying, and expressing anger are normal parts of the emotional healing process.

Both are long-term treatments that may require weeks or months before you notice significant results. You may need treatment with counseling and possibly medicines for more than a year. Bulimia that occurs with another condition may take longer to treat. If you have another condition that commonly occurs with bulimia, such as depression or substance abuse, your doctor may want to treat that condition first. People who seek treatment for bulimia or another eating disorder may have other health problems caused by the disorder. If you have had bulimia for a long time without treatment, or if you have used substances such as laxatives, diuretics, or ipecac syrup to purge, then you may have a health problem such as dehydration that needs treatment first. In serious cases, these conditions related to bulimia may require you to spend time in the hospital. Initial treatment depends how severe the bulimia is and how long you have had it. If you have no other conditions that need treatment first, then treatment for bulimia usually consists of: Medicines. Antidepressants, such as fluoxetine (Prozac, for example), are sometimes used to reduce binge-purge cycles and relieve symptoms of depression that often occur along with eating disorders. In CBT you learn how to change negative thoughts that you may have about food, your weight, your body, or beliefs about yourself. To help correct these relationship patterns, so that you won't binge eat or purge in response to bad feelings. Continuing treatment usually consists of: Psychological counseling, such as interpersonal psychotherapy or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Antidepressants can help lower the number of binge-purge cycles you have and may also be used to treat another related condition, such as depression or anxiety. If you develop other health problems such as dehydration or an esophageal tear because of bulimia, you may need to stay in the hospital or in an eating disorder treatment facility. Sometimes people with bulimia get discouraged because recovery can take a long time and relapse is common. If you or the person with bulimia feels very discouraged or feels suicidal, call a doctor or other health professional immediately to get help.

It is common for another mental health problem (such as depression, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorder) to play a part in an eating disorder. Common exams and tests for a possible eating disorder include: Questions about your medical history, including your physical and emotional health, both present and past. A physical exam to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, weight, mouth, skin, and hair for diet problems. Blood tests to check for signs of malnutrition, such as low potassium levels or other chemical imbalances. People with bulimia often seek medical care for related health concerns, such as fatigue or stomach problems caused by repeated vomiting. It is common for a person with bulimia to try to hide symptoms, which can make it hard to detect. Most often a loved one thinks that there is a problem and seeks help for bulimia.

Struggles with cultural and social factors such as admiring thinness."], [1421, "Bulimia Nervosa (Sensitive Topic) What Happens", "In order to help cope with these feelings, you follow a strict diet to try to lose weight. Binge eating may also be triggered by a stressful event, when food gives you a sense of comfort. Feeling guilty and ashamed of binge eating can cause you to purge to avoid weight gain. As bulimia develops, you may not eat at the beginning of the day. But later you may binge to comfort yourself, especially at the end of a stressful day. Vomiting causes the body to release endorphins, which are natural chemicals that make you feel good. After bulimia becomes a pattern, it is very hard to return to normal eating without help. If not treated, bulimia can lead to serious, long-term health problems. By the time others discover the disorder, many people with bulimia already have serious problems. These range from mild to severe, depending on the type of purging behaviors and how long they have continued. Health problems caused by bulimia include: Tooth decay, toothaches, swollen gums, gum disease (gingivitis), and erosion of tooth enamel. Electrolyte imbalances and changes in metabolism that can lead to heart problems, such as arrhythmia and even death. Dehydration, which can lead to weakness, fainting, or kidney damage. Inflammation or tears of the esophagus, which may cause bloody vomit. Long-term problems with bowel movements because of laxative abuse. Other mental health problems often occur along with bulimia, which may make treatment take longer or make bulimia harder to treat.1 These conditions include: Depression, which commonly occurs with eating disorders and increases related feelings of guilt, anxiety, and obsession. Borderline personality disorder, which more commonly occurs with bulimia than with other eating disorders. Anxiety and anxiety disorders. Although bulimia is a long-term disorder linked to serious health problems, it can be successfully treated. About half of people with bulimia recover completely with treatment. 2 Although treatment is usually successful, bulimia is a long-term disorder, and setbacks can occur. But with ongoing treatment and patience, most people can eventually overcome bulimia. These teens often lose weight before their diabetes is discovered, then quickly gain weight when treatment begins. This causes poor control of their diabetes and can result in serious problems that can lead to blindness or kidney failure."], [1422, "Bulimia Nervosa (Sensitive Topic) Symptoms", "Symptoms of bulimia include: Repeated binge eating, or eating larger amounts of food than most people would in a similar situation, in a short period of time (2 hours or less). Frequently getting rid of the calories you've eaten (purging) by making yourself vomit, fasting, exercising too much, or misusing laxatives, diuretics, ipecac syrup, or enemas. Feeling ashamed of overeating and very fearful of gaining weight. Thinking about food, your body, or dieting so much that it distracts you from other tasks. Any of the above symptoms can be a sign of bulimia or another eating disorder that needs treatment. If you or someone you know has any of these symptoms, talk to a doctor, friend, or family member about your concerns right away. Often a person won't get evaluation and treatment until someone else notices the signs of bulimia and encourages the person to seek the help that he or she needs. Common signs that a person may have bulimia are when the person: Is very secretive about eating and does not eat around other people. Sneaks food or hides food in the house. For example, the person may gain and lose large amounts of weight in short periods of time. Has low levels of potassium or other blood electrolyte imbalances. Looks sick or has symptoms such as: Tooth decay or erosion of tooth enamel.Sore gums or mouth sores.Dry skin.Loose skin.Thin or dull hair.Swollen salivary glands.Bloating or fullness.Lack of energy.Teeth marks on the backs of the hands or calluses on the knuckles from self-induced vomiting.

Feels depressed, anxious, or guilty. Drinks large amounts of alcohol or uses illegal drugs and may have a substance abuse problem. Conditions that commonly occur with bulimia, such as depression, substance abuse, or anxiety disorders, can make treatment of bulimia harder. Recovery from bulimia can take a long time. Warning signs of possible suicide in children and teens can include being preoccupied with death or suicide, giving away belongings, withdrawing, being angry, or having failing grades. Warning signs and possible triggers of suicide in adults can include alcohol or substance abuse, depression, giving away belongings, a recent job loss, or divorce. If you or someone you know shows warning signs of suicide, seek help immediately. For more information, see the topic Anorexia Nervosa."], [1423, "Bulimia Nervosa (Sensitive Topic) Cause", "The cause of bulimia is not clear, but it probably results from a combination of genetics, family behaviors, social values (such as admiring thinness), and other things that can put someone at risk (such as perfectionism). Stressful life events such as moving, divorce, or the death of a loved one can trigger bulimia in some people. Many young women, such as those in college or high school, have unhealthy attitudes toward eating and toward their bodies. Socially, they may accept and encourage destructive behaviors like extreme dieting or binge eating and purging. Bulimia, like all eating disorders, is a complex physical and psychological condition. Recovery requires treatment that helps you change your behavior and also deals with the deeper attitudes and feelings that cause you to binge and purge."], [1424, "Bulimia Nervosa (Sensitive Topic) Topic Overview", "Bulimia (say \"boo-LEE-mee-uh\") is a type of eating disorder. People with bulimia will eat a larger amount of food than most people would in a similar situation, in a short period of time (binge). Then, in order to prevent weight gain, they will do something to get rid of the food (purge). People who have bulimia judge themselves harshly on their body weight and shape. In order to help them cope with these feelings, they follow a strict diet to try to lose weight. But over time the hunger from the strict diet triggers them to binge eat. After binge eating, they feel out of control, ashamed, guilty, and afraid of gaining weight. This distress causes them to purge, in hopes of \"undoing\" any possible weight gain from the binge. Acid in the mouth from vomiting can cause tooth decay, gum disease, and loss of tooth enamel. Any type of purging can lead to bone thinning (osteoporosis), kidney damage, heart problems, or even death. If you or someone you know has bulimia or another eating disorder, get help. Treatment can help a person who has an eating disorder feel better and be healthier. All eating disorders are complex problems, and experts do not really know what causes them. But they may be caused by a mix of family history, social factors, and personality traits. You may be more likely to have bulimia if: Other people in your family are obese or have an eating disorder. Have a poor body image, or feel that your body should be slim like many people in the media. You are the type of person who tries to be perfect all the time, never feels good enough, or worries a lot. You are dealing with stressful life events, such as divorce, moving to a new town or school, or losing a loved one. Bulimia is most common in: Teens. Like other eating disorders, bulimia usually starts in the teen years. While bulimia often starts in the teen years, it usually lasts into adulthood and is a long-term disorder. People with bulimia: Binge eat on a regular basis. They eat larger amounts of food than most people would in a similar situation, in a short period of time (2 hours or less). During a binge, they feel out of control and feel unable to stop eating. Purge to get rid of the food and avoid weight gain. They may make themselves vomit, exercise very hard or for a long time, or misuse laxatives, enemas, water pills (diuretics), or other medicines. Any one of these can be a sign of an eating disorder that needs treatment. Bulimia is different from anorexia nervosa, another eating disorder. People who have anorexia eat so little that they become extremely thin. People who have bulimia may not be thin. This makes it hard for others to know that a person with bulimia has a serious problem. Is secretive about eating, hides food, or will not eat around other people. Bulimia can be treated with psychological counseling and sometimes medicines, such as antidepressants. By working with a counselor, a person with bulimia can learn to feel better about herself. Other mental health problems such as depression often happen with bulimia. If a person has another condition along with bulimia, more treatment may be needed, and it may take longer to get better. Eating disorders can take a long time to overcome. And it is common to fall back into unhealthy ways of eating. If you think a friend or loved one has bulimia, you can help. Urge him or her to talk to someone who can help, like a doctor or counselor. Tell someone who can make a difference, like a parent, teacher, counselor, or doctor. The sooner your friend or loved one gets help, the sooner she will be healthy again. How can I show support for a loved one with bulimia?"], [1425, "Brain Tumors, General", "Brain tumors are abnormal growths of cells in the brain. Although such growths are popularly called brain tumors, not all brain tumors are cancer. Like all cells of the body, tumor cells need blood and nutrients to survive. In the U.S., brain or nervous system tumors affect about 6 of every 1,000 people. Some brain cancers occur when one type of cell transforms from its normal characteristics. The most common primary brain tumors are gliomas, meningiomas, pituitary adenomas, vestibular schwannomas, and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (medulloblastomas). The term glioma includes glioblastomas, astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and ependymomas. Most of these are named after the part of the brain or the type of brain cell from which they arise. Metastatic brain tumors are made of cancerous cells from a tumor elsewhere in the body. The cells spread to the brain from another tumor in a process called metastasis. As with tumors elsewhere in the body, the exact cause of most brain cancer is unknown. Genetic factors, various environmental toxins, radiation to the head, HIV infection, and cigarette smoking have all been linked to cancers of the brain. MRI Brain Cancer Picture: Side view section through the brain of a young girl. MRI Brain Cancer Picture: Cross-section (image taken from the top of the head down) of a brain tumor in a young girl."], [1426, "Brain Tumors in Adults", "Children who receive radiation to the head have a higher risk of developing a brain tumor as adults, as do people who have certain rare genetic conditions such as neurofibromatosis or Li-Fraumeni syndrome. But those cases represent a fraction of the approximately 28,000 new primary brain tumors diagnosed each year in the United States. People between the ages of 65 and 79 make up the population most likely to be diagnosed with a brain tumor. A primary brain tumor is one that originates in the brain, and not all primary brain tumors are cancerous; benign tumors are not aggressive and normally do not spread to surrounding tissues, although they can be serious and even life threatening. A tumor is a mass of tissue that's formed by an accumulation of abnormal cells. As this process goes on, the tumor continues to grow as more and more cells are added to the mass. Primary brain tumors emerge from the various cells that make up the brain and central nervous system and are named for the kind of cell in which they first form. The most common types of adult brain tumors are gliomas as in astrocytic tumors. These form in the meninges, the thin layer of tissue that covers the brain and spinal cord. Malignant primary brain tumors are cancers that originate in the brain, typically grow faster than benign tumors, and aggressively invade surrounding tissue. Although brain cancer rarely spreads to other organs, it can spread to other parts of the brain and central nervous system. This makes them easier to surgically remove, assuming they are in an area of the brain that can be safely operated on. Although benign tumors in other parts of the body can cause problems, they are not generally considered to be a major health problem or to be life-threatening. Symptoms of brain tumors vary according to the type of tumor and the location. Other symptoms include: Seizures Changes in speech or hearing Changes in vision Balance problems Problems with walking Numbness or tingling in the arms or legs Problems with memory Personality changes Inability to concentrate Weakness in one part of the body It's important to keep in mind that these symptoms can be caused by a number of different conditions. To diagnose a brain tumor, the doctor starts by asking questions about your symptoms and taking a personal and family health history. If there's reason to suspect a brain tumor, the doctor may request one or more of the following tests: Imaging studies such as a CT(CAT) scan or MRI to see detailed images of the brain Angiogram or MRA, which involve the use of dye and X-rays of blood vessels in the brain to look for signs of a tumor or abnormal blood vessels The doctor may also ask for a biopsy to determine whether or not the tumor is cancer. A tissue sample is removed from the brain either during surgery to remove the tumor or with a needle inserted through a small hole drilled into the skull before treatment is started. Surgery to remove the tumor is typically the first option once a brain tumor has been diagnosed. In those cases, chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be options for killing and shrinking the tumor. Sometimes, chemotherapy or radiation is also used after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells. Tumors that are deep in the brain or in areas that are difficult to reach may be treated with Gamma Knife therapy, which is a form of highly focused radiation therapy. Because treatment for cancer also can damage healthy tissue, it's important to discuss possible side and long-term effects of whatever treatment is being used with your doctor. The doctor can also explain the importance of planning for rehabilitation following treatment. Rehabilitation could involve working with several different therapists, such as: Physical therapist to regain strength and balance Speech therapist to address problems with speaking, expressing thoughts, or swallowing Occupational therapist to help manage daily activities such as using the bathroom, bathing, and dressing"], [1427, "Brain Aneurysm", "A brain (cerebral) aneurysm is a bulging, weak area in the wall of an artery that supplies blood to the brain. In most cases, a brain aneurysm causes no symptoms and goes unnoticed. In rare cases, the brain aneurysm ruptures, releasing blood into the skull and causing a stroke. When a brain aneurysm ruptures, the result is called a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Depending on the severity of the hemorrhage, brain damage or death may result. The most common location for brain aneurysms is in the network of blood vessels at the base of the brain called the circle of Willis. A person may inherit the tendency to form aneurysms, or aneurysms may develop because of hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and aging. Some risk factors that can lead to brain aneurysms can be controlled, and others can't. The following risk factors may increase your risk for an aneurysm or, if you already have an aneurysm, may increase your risk of it rupturing: Family history. People who have a family history of brain aneurysms are more likely to have an aneurysm than those who don't. In addition to being a cause of high blood pressure, the use of cigarettes may greatly increase the chances of a brain aneurysm rupturing. Most brain aneurysms cause no symptoms and may only be discovered during tests for another, usually unrelated, condition. When this happens, the person may suffer from severe headaches, blurred vision, changes in speech, and neck pain, depending on what areas of the brain are affected and how bad the aneurysm is. Symptoms of a ruptured brain aneurysm often come on suddenly. Because unruptured brain aneurysms often do not cause any symptoms, many are discovered in people who are being treated for a different condition. If your doctor believes that you have a brain aneurysm, you may have the following tests: Computed tomography (CT) scan. Sometimes a lumbar puncture may be used if your doctor suspects that you have a ruptured cerebral aneurysm with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. CTA uses a combination of CT scanning, special computer techniques, and contrast material (dye) injected into the blood to produce images of blood vessels. Although this test is more invasive and carries more risk than the above tests, it is the best way to locate small (less than 5 mm) brain aneurysms. Things that will determine the type of treatment you receive include your age, size of the aneurysm, any additional risk factors, and your overall health. Because the risk of a small (less than 10 mm) aneurysm rupturing is low and surgery for a brain aneurysm is often risky, your doctor may want to continue to observe your condition rather than do surgery. Your doctor may suggest ways to keep your blood vessels as healthy as possible, such as managing high blood pressure and not smoking. If your aneurysm is large or causing pain or other symptoms, though, or if you have had a previous ruptured aneurysm, your doctor may recommend surgery. The following procedures are used to treat both ruptured and unruptured brain aneurysms: Endovascular embolization. During this procedure, a small tube is inserted into the affected artery and positioned near the aneurysm. For coil embolization, soft metal coils are then moved through the tube into the aneurysm, filling the aneurysm and making it less likely to rupture. In mesh embolization, mesh is placed in the aneurysm, reducing blood flow to the aneurysm and making it less likely to rupture. But they involve risks, including rupture of the aneurysm. This surgery involves placing a small metal clip around the base of the aneurysm to isolate it from normal blood circulation. Whether this surgery can be done depends on the location of the aneurysm, its size, and your general health. Some aneurysms bulge in such a way that the aneurysm has to be cut out and the ends of the blood vessel stitched together, but this is very rare. Sometimes the artery is not long enough to stitch together, and a piece of another artery has to be used. Management includes hospitalization, intensive care to relieve pressure in the brain and maintain breathing and vital functions (such as blood pressure), and treatment to prevent rebleeding."], [1428, "BPES", "Blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare disorder that is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.

To learn about using a bottle to feed breast milk to your baby or to learn about breastfeeding, see the topic Breastfeeding. If you are having a hard time breastfeeding and are trying to decide whether to switch to using formula, know that the first few weeks of breastfeeding are the most challenging. You may want to talk to your health care provider to help you make your choice. You may not be able to breastfeed for different health reasons, such as if you've had breast surgery or if you have certain infections. While breast milk is the ideal food for babies, your baby can get good nutrition from formula. Formulas are designed to give babies all the calories and nutrients they need. If your baby is at risk for low iron, talk to your health care provider about the type of formula your baby needs. Talk to your health care provider before you try other types of formulas: Soy formulas may be recommended for babies who are unable to tolerate cow's-milk formulas or for vegetarian parents who don't want to feed their babies animal products. Or soy formulas may be chosen for cultural, ethical, or religious reasons. It should not be given to any infant who has a soy protein allergy. Lactose-free formulas are used for babies who are lactose-intolerant, which means that they can't digest lactose, a natural sugar found in foods with cow's milk. Hydrolyzed protein or amino acid formulas are used for babies who cannot tolerate formulas made from cow's milk or soy. Homemade formulas do not contain the nutrients, vitamins, and minerals your baby needs. When you make formula, use safe water and be sure your hands and equipment are clean. Follow the advice of your health care provider, and read the label on the formula package. Make sure the formula is not too hot or too cold when you give it to your baby. As you get to know your baby, you will be able to notice his or her signs of hunger and fullness. Don't hesitate to call your health care provider if you are worried about whether your baby is eating enough. Throw away any formula left in the bottle after you feed your baby, because bacteria can grow in the leftover formula. Other kinds of milk, such as goat's milk, soy milk, fat-free milk, 1% milk, or 2% milk, don't have as many nutrients as whole-fat milk. It is best not to give your baby these kinds of milk if you can give whole-fat milk instead."], [1431, "Borderline Personality Disorder", "Borderline personality disorder is a mental illness that causes intense mood swings, impulsive behaviors, and severe problems with self-worth. Most of the time, signs of the disorder first appear in childhood. But problems often don't start until early adulthood. Treatment can be hard, and getting better can take years. Problems with emotions and behaviors are hard to improve. But with treatment, most people with severe symptoms do get better over time. Problems with chemicals in the brain that help control moods may play a role. Often, people who get it faced some kind of childhood trauma such as abuse, neglect, or the death of a parent. The risk is higher when people who had childhood trauma also have problems coping with anxiety or stress. Everyone has problems with emotions or behaviors sometimes. But if you have borderline personality disorder, the problems are severe, repeat over a long time, and disrupt your life. The most common symptoms include: Intense emotions and mood swings. Harmful, impulsive behaviors. These may include things like substance abuse, binge eating, out-of-control spending, risky sexual behavior, and reckless driving. You may see others as either \"good\" or \"bad\" and may shift from one view to the other suddenly, for minor reasons. Problems with anger, such as violent temper tantrums. So if you think that you or someone you know may have borderline personality disorder, see a doctor. And many people with the disorder have troubled relationships with their counselors and doctors. Long-term treatment can reduce symptoms and harmful behaviors and help you better manage your emotions. Treatment may include: Counseling and therapy. This can be hard, because your condition may cause you to see your counselor as caring one minute and cruel the next, especially when he or she asks you to try to change a behavior. Try to find a counselor who has special training in dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) to treat this disorder. In combination with counseling or therapy, they may be helpful in treating symptoms of borderline personality disorder. And they can help make your symptoms less severe and less frequent. Many people find relief from harmful symptoms within the first year of treatment.1 And about half of those treated find that they no longer have most of the behaviors after about 10 years of treatment.1 Unfortunately, many people don't seek treatment for mental health problems. They may think that their symptoms aren't bad enough or that they can work things out on their own. But getting treatment is key to improving your symptoms and the quality of your life. People with this disorder often have other mental health problems such as depression, eating disorders, or substance abuse. Treatment can help with these problems too. Show love, and learn as much as you can about the illness. Understand that the behavior you may see-which may include anger directed at you-is caused by the illness, not by the person you love.

Most people think of something sharp when they think of a \"spur,\" but a bone spur is just extra bone. It's usually smooth, but it can cause wear and tear or pain if it presses or rubs on other bones or soft tissues such as ligaments, tendons, or nerves in the body. Common places for bone spurs include the spine, shoulders, hands, hips, knees, and feet. As we age, the slippery tissue called cartilage that covers the ends of the bones within joints breaks down and eventually wears away (osteoarthritis). Over time, this leads to pain and swelling and, in some cases, bone spurs forming along the edges of the joint. Bone spurs also form in the feet in response to tight ligaments, to activities such as dancing and running that put stress on the feet, and to pressure from being overweight or from poorly fitting shoes. For example, the long ligament on the bottom of the foot (plantar fascia) can become stressed or tight and pull on the heel, causing the ligament to become inflamed (plantar fasciitis). As the bone tries to mend itself, a bone spur can form on the bottom of the heel (known as a \"heel spur\"). Pressure at the back of the heel from frequently wearing shoes that are too tight can cause a bone spur on the back of the heel. Bone spurs can form in this narrow area that, in turn, pinch the rotator cuff tendons, resulting in irritation, inflammation, stiffness, weakness, pain, and sometimes tearing of the tendon. It is also common in athletes, especially baseball players, and in people such as painters who frequently work with their arms above their heads. But if the bone spurs are pressing on other bones or tissues or are causing a muscle or tendon to rub, they can break that tissue down over time, causing swelling, pain, and tearing. Bone spurs in the foot can also cause corns and calluses when tissue builds up to provide added padding over the bone spur. If you had an X-ray to evaluate one of the problems associated with bone spurs, such as arthritis, bone spurs would be visible on that X-ray. Treatment directed at the cause of bone spurs may include weight loss to take some pressure off the joints (especially when osteoarthritis or plantar fasciitis is the cause) and stretching the affected area, such as the heel cord and bottom of the foot. Treatment directed at symptoms could include rest, ice, stretching, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen. If a bone spur is in your foot, changing footwear or adding padding or a shoe insert such as a heel cup or orthotic may help. If the bone spur is causing corns or calluses, padding the area or wearing different shoes can help. If the bone spur continues to cause symptoms, your doctor may suggest a corticosteroid injection at the painful area to reduce pain and inflammation of the soft tissues next to the bone spur. Bone spurs can be surgically removed or treated as part of a surgery to repair or replace a joint when osteoarthritis has caused considerable damage and deformity. Examples might include repair of a bunion or heel spur in the foot or removal of small spurs underneath the point of the shoulder."], [1434, "BMD", "Becker muscular dystrophy is in the category of inherited muscle wasting diseases caused by a gene abnormality (mutation) that results in deficient or abnormal production of the dystrophin protein (dystrophinopathies).

You may need a blood transfusion if you lose too much blood, such as through: Injury or major surgery. If you have an illness in which your bone marrow doesn't make enough blood, such as aplastic anemia, you may need transfusions. Blood used for transfusions in the United States is very safe and generally free from disease. It is very rare to get a disease through a blood transfusion. Getting the wrong blood type by accident is the main risk in a blood transfusion, but it is rare. For every 1 million units of blood transfused, getting the wrong blood type happens, at the most, 4 times.1 Transfusion with the wrong blood type can cause a severe reaction that may be life-threatening.2 Some people bank their own blood a few weeks before they have surgery. If they need a transfusion during surgery, they can receive their own banked blood. This reduces the risk of disease and transfusion reaction from donated blood. If you have many blood transfusions, you are more likely to have problems from immune system reactions. A reaction causes your body to form antibodies that attack the new blood cells. Before you get a blood transfusion, your blood is tested to find out your blood type. You may have a mild allergic reaction even if you get the correct blood type. The most important blood type classification systems are the ABO system and the Rh system. A, B, AB, and O are the blood types in the ABO system. Each type of blood in the ABO system also has a positive or negative Rh factor. For example, if you have \"A+ blood,\" it means your blood is type A in the ABO system and your Rh factor is positive. If you get blood in a transfusion that isn't the right type, you may have a transfusion reaction. If there is any chance that the blood may not be safe to use, it is thrown away. Most blood that passes the tests is then split into its components and sent out for use. Blood and its components can be stored or used for only a short time before they must be thrown away."], [1436, "Blood and Body Fluid Precautions", "Blood and body fluid precautions are recommendations designed to prevent the transmission of HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and other diseases while giving first aid or other health care that includes contact with body fluids or blood. These precautions treat all blood and body fluids as potentially infectious for diseases that are transmitted in the blood. Blood and body fluid precautions apply to blood and other body fluids that contain visible traces of blood, semen, and vaginal fluids. They also apply to tissues and other body fluids, such as from around the brain or spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid), around a joint space (synovial fluid), in the lungs (pleural fluid), in the lining of the belly and pelvis (peritoneal fluid), around the heart (pericardial fluid), and amniotic fluid that surrounds a fetus. Although skin provides some protection from exposure to potentially infectious substances, it is strongly recommended that health professionals use blood and body fluid precautions for further protection when they are providing health care. These precautions also help protect you from exposure to a potential infection from your health professional in the unlikely event that you come in contact with the health professional's blood. The American Red Cross recommends that everyone use blood and body fluid precautions when giving first aid. The best practice is to always use blood and body fluid precautions, even when you can't see any blood and there's no chance that blood is present. But the precautions aren't absolutely needed if you don't see any blood when you come in contact with other body fluids, such as: Breast milk. Blood and body fluid precautions involve the use of protective barriers such as gloves, gowns, masks, and eye protection. Health care workers should always use protective barriers to protect themselves from exposure to another person's blood or body fluids. The use of gloves also decreases the risk of disease transmission if you are pricked with a needle. Always wear gloves for handling items or surfaces soiled with blood or body fluids.Wear gloves if you have scraped, cut, or chapped skin on your hands.Change your gloves after each use.Wash your hands immediately after removing your gloves.Wash your hands and other skin surfaces immediately after they come in contact with blood or body fluids. Wash your hands and other skin surfaces immediately after they come in contact with blood or body fluids. Masks and protective eyewear, such as goggles or a face shield, help protect your eyes, mouth, and nose from droplets of blood and other body fluids. Always wear a mask and protective eyewear if you are doing a procedure that may expose you to splashes or sprays of blood or body fluids. Gowns or aprons protect you from splashes of blood or body fluids. Always wear a gown or apron if you are doing a procedure that may expose you to splashes or sprays of blood or body fluids. The American Red Cross recommends that everyone use blood and body fluid precautions while giving first aid.

Doctors have many ways to find out what stage of breast cancer you have. A doctor called a pathologist puts tissue samples from the breast and lymph nodes under the microscope to find out even more. Based on these findings, doctors string together letters and numbers to assign a stage to every case of breast cancer. Think of it like this: The longer the list of letters and numbers, the more exact the diagnosis and the more precise the treatment plan. The stages are the number zero and the Roman numerals I, II, III, or IV (often followed by A, B, or C). In general, the higher the number, the more advanced the cancer. You're likely to hear or see the words in situ, meaning \"in the original place.\" Starting at this level, breast cancer is called invasive, meaning it has broken free to attack healthy tissue. Stage 1A means the cancer has spread into the fatty breast tissue. The tumor itself is no larger than a shelled peanut, or there may be no tumor Stage IB means some cancer cells, but just tiny amounts, have been found in a few lymph nodes. IIA means the tumor in the breast is still small, if there's one at all. There may be no cancer in the lymph nodes, or it may have spread to as many as three. A stage IIB breast tumor is bigger -- it may be the size of a walnut or as big as a lime. The cancer has not spread to bones or organs, but it's considered advanced, and it's harder to fight. IIIA means the cancer has been found in up to nine of the lymph nodes that form a chain from your underarm to your collarbone. Or it has spread to or enlarged the lymph nodes deep in your breast. In some cases there is a large tumor in the breast, but other times there's no tumor. It's also IIIC if fewer lymph nodes outside the breast are affected but those inside it are enlarged or cancerous. This stage is described as \"metastatic,\" meaning it has spread beyond the region of the body where it was first found. \"T\" stands for tumor, or the lump of cancer found in the breast itself. \"N\" stands for nodes, as in lymph nodes. These small filters are found throughout the body, and they're especially dense in and around the breast. Here, too, a number (0-III) tells you whether the cancer has spread to lymph nodes near the breast and, if so, how many. The cancer has spread beyond the breast and lymph nodes. The 5-year survival rate shows how many people live for at least 5 years after being diagnosed with breast cancer. The lower the stage, the better the chances of living longer. According to the National Cancer Institute, the 5-year survival rates for breast cancer are: Stage 0: 100% Stage I: 100% Stage II: 93% Stage III: 72% Stage IV: 22% A breast cancer diagnosis is a lot to take in."], [1438, "Blocked Tear Ducts", "Tears normally drain from the eye through small tubes called tear ducts , which stretch from the eye into the nose. If a tear duct becomes blocked or fails to open, tears cannot drain from the eye properly. The duct may fill with fluid and become swollen, inflamed, and sometimes infected. Blocked tear ducts happen most often in babies, though they may occur at any age. They affect about 6 out of 100 newborns.1 Most of the time, blocked tear ducts in babies clear up on their own during the baby's first year. They usually have no effect on the baby's vision or cause any lasting eye problems. Causes of blocked tear ducts in children include: Failure of the thin tissue at the end of the tear duct to open normally. Abnormal growth of the nasal bone that puts pressure on a tear duct and closes it off. Closed or undeveloped openings in the corners of the eyes where tears drain into the tear ducts. In adults, blocked tear ducts may be caused by an injury to the bones or tissues around the eyes or by another disorder, sometimes related to aging. For example, a blocked tear duct may result from a thickening of the tear duct lining, abnormal tissue or structures in the nose, or problems from surgery on or around the nose. Babies who have blocked tear ducts usually have symptoms within the first few days to the first few weeks after birth. The symptoms of a blocked tear duct may get worse after an upper respiratory infection, such as a cold or sinus infection. A blocked tear duct is diagnosed based on a medical history and a physical exam. Most babies who have blocked tear ducts don't need treatment. To wipe away drainage , moisten a clean cotton ball or washcloth with warm water, and gently wipe from the inner (near the nose) to the outer part of the eye. If signs of infection develop, your baby may need antibiotics. Sometimes a probing procedure may be done to open the duct if the duct doesn't clear on its own. Probing successfully opens the duct for about 80 out of 100 babies who have blocked ducts.1 In rare cases, babies with blocked tear ducts have a more severe problem that requires more complex surgery. In adults who have blocked tear ducts, treatment depends on the cause of the blockage. If the duct is blocked because of a long-term infection, antibiotics may be used. Surgery may be needed for structural problems or abnormal growths."], [1439, "Blisters", "Blisters are fluid-filled bumps that look like bubbles on the skin.

Other types of injuries to the skin that may cause a blister include: Burns from exposure to heat, electricity, chemicals, radiation from the sun, or friction. Symptoms of a brown recluse spider bite include reddened skin followed by a blister that forms at the bite site, pain and itching, and an open sore with a breakdown of tissue (necrosis) that develops within a few hours to 3 to 4 days following the bite. Chickenpox (varicella) is a common contagious illness that is caused by a type of herpes virus. It is most contagious from 2 to 3 days before a rash develops until all the blisters have crusted over. Shingles blisters look like chickenpox, but they usually develop in a band on one side of the body. Symptoms include a rash of small sores or blisters that usually appear on the hands and feet and in the mouth. Cold sores , sometimes called fever blisters, are clusters of small blisters on the lip and outer edge of the mouth. Cold sore-type blisters that develop in the genital area may be caused by a genital herpes infection. Its blisters, which often occur on the face, burst and become crusty (honey-colored crusts). Infected hair follicles (folliculitis ) cause red, tender areas that turn into blisters at or near the base of strands of hair. A scabies infection, which occurs when mites burrow into the skin, may cause tiny, itchy blisters that often occur in a thin line or curved track. Blisters may develop from a disease that causes your body to attack your own skin (autoimmune disease). The blisters may be small or large and usually occur with reddened, itchy skin. If the blisters are not severe and you do not have other symptoms, stopping the use of the medicine or ointment may be all that is needed. Blisters may also occur as a symptom of a toxic reaction to a medicine.

You make countless trips to the bathroom, and still you feel like you have to go again. When you get a bladder infection, it leads to cystitis, which is when your bladder swells and gets irritated. A bladder the most common type of urinary tract infection (UTI). Here are the parts of your urinary tract and what they do: Your kidneysclean waste from your blood and make pee. Your urethra carries pee from the bladder to outside your body. But they can travel up the ureters to the kidneys and cause more severe problems, so it's important to treat them right away. But if they get into the urethra, they can end up in the bladder and cause an infection. Having sex, wiping from back to front after you go to the bathroom, putting in a tampon, and using a diaphragm for birth control are all ways bacteria can get in. During pregnancy, the baby can press on your bladder, which prevents it from emptying completely and gives bacteria a place to thrive. That causes the lining of the urethra to get thinner and may change the balance of bacteria in the vagina, making infections more likely. When men get them, a prostate infection usually is the cause. But any blockage -- like from a bladder stone or enlarged prostate -- can prevent the bladder from totally emptying and cause infection."], [1441, "Bladder Infections in Children", "For information about these infections in teens and adults, see the topic Urinary Tract Infections in Teens and Adults. The urinary tract is the part of the body that makes urine and carries it out of the body. When germs (called bacteria) get into the urinary tract, they can cause an infection. But if your child keeps getting infections, your doctor may suggest tests to rule out more serious problems. Urinary infections can lead to a serious infection throughout the body called sepsis. Problems from a urinary infection are more likely to happen in babies born too soon, in newborns, and in infants who have something blocking the flow of urine. This is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. In a baby or a young child, look for: A fever not caused by the flu or another known illness. Older children are more likely to have common symptoms, such as: Pain or burning when they urinate. Needing to urinate often. Red, pink, cloudy, or foul-smelling urine. The doctor will give your child a physical exam and ask about his or her symptoms. Your child also will have lab tests, such as a urinalysis and a urine culture, to check for germs in the urine. It takes 1 to 2 days to get the results of a urine culture, so many doctors will prescribe medicine to fight the infection without waiting for the results. This is because a child's symptoms and the urinalysis may be enough to show an infection. After your child gets better, the doctor may have him or her tested to find out if there is a problem with the urinary tract. For example, urine might flow backward from the bladder into the kidneys. Problems like this can make a child more likely to get an infection in the bladder or kidneys. Your child will take antibiotics for a urinary tract infection. Give this medicine to your child as your doctor says. He or she needs to take all the medicine to get better. The number of days a child will need to take the medicine depends on the illness, the child's age, and the type of antibiotic. Call the doctor if your child isn't feeling better within 2 days after starting the medicine. Your doctor may give your child a different medicine. It is important to treat urinary infections quickly in children to prevent other serious health problems. Sometimes a baby younger than 3 months may need to get medicine through a vein (IV) and stay in the hospital for a while. A child who is too sick to take medicine by mouth or has trouble fighting infections also may need to stay in the hospital."], [1442, "BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)", "You can do a lot to take care of yourself and give your body what it needs. It's a natural part of aging, but at some point, it can lead to a condition called BPH, or benign prostatic hyperplasia. Your prostate surrounds part of your urethra, the tube that carries urine and semen out of your penis. When you have BPH, your prostate is larger than usual, which squeezes the urethra. This can cause a weak stream when you pee and cause you to wake up a lot at night to go to the bathroom. BPH isn't prostate cancer and doesn't make you more likely to get it. Your doctor can help you choose the best care based on your age, health, and how the condition affects you. Some think it may have to do with normal hormonal changes as you age, but it's not clear. This causes symptoms that affect your urine flow, such as: Dribbling when you finish A hard time getting started A weak stream, or you pee in stops and starts When your urethra is squeezed, it also means your bladder has to work harder to push urine out. Over time, the bladder muscles get weak, which makes it harder for it to empty. Your doctor will first talk to you about your personal and family medical history. You might also fill out a survey, answering questions about your symptoms and how they affect you daily. During this, he puts on a glove and gently inserts one finger into your rectum to check the size and shape of your prostate. Basic tests: Your doctor may start with one or more of these: Blood tests to check for kidney problems Urine tests to look for infection or other problems that could be causing your symptoms PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood test. Advanced tests: Based on the results of those tests, your doctor may order additional tests to rule out other problems or to see more clearly what's happening. These might include: Different types of ultrasound to measure your prostate and see if it looks healthy Biopsy to rule out cancer Urine flow test to measure how strong your stream is and how much pee you make How your doctor handles your case varies based on your age, health, the size of your prostate, and how BPH affects you. If your symptoms don't bother you too much, you can put off treatment and see how it goes. For example, you can: Do exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles Lower the amount of fluids you drink, especially before you go out or go to bed Drink less caffeine and alcohol Medicine: For mild to moderate BPH, your doctor might suggest medicine. For some men, it takes a mix of medicines to get the best results. Procedures: If lifestyle changes and medications don't work, your doctor has a number of ways to remove part or all of your prostate. Many of these are called \"minimally invasive,\" meaning they're easier on you than regular surgery. An example of a minimally invasive procedure is water-induced thermotherapy to destroy part of the prostate with heated water. Other surgical procedures include: Laser therapy to remove part of your prostate Transurethral resection of the prostate, or TURP, in which the doctor uses a scope and cuts out pieces of the gland with a wire loop In some cases, your doctor may also suggest a traditional, open surgery to remove your prostate.

It organizes, explains, and directs interactions between you and the world around you. The nervous system controls: Sight, hearing, taste, smell, and feeling (sensation). Voluntary and involuntary functions, such as movement, balance, and coordination. The nervous system also regulates the actions of most other body systems, such as blood flow and blood pressure. The nervous system allows you to be conscious and have thoughts, memories, and language. The nervous system is divided into the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system, or CNS) and the nerve cells that control voluntary and involuntary movements (peripheral nervous system, or PNS). The symptoms of a nervous system problem depend on which area of the nervous system is involved and what is causing the problem. Nervous system problems may occur slowly and cause a gradual loss of function (degenerative). Or they may occur suddenly and cause life-threatening problems (acute). Some serious conditions, diseases, and injuries that can cause nervous system problems include: Blood supply problems (vascular disorders). Injuries (trauma), especially injuries to the head and spinal cord. Problems that are present at birth (congenital). Problems that cause a gradual loss of function (degenerative). Multiple sclerosis (MS). These may occur in the: Brain (encephalitis or abscesses).Membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord (meningitis). Membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord (meningitis). Overuse of or withdrawal from prescription and nonprescription medicines, illegal drugs, or alcohol. Kidney failure (uremia). Electrolyte problems.Nutritional deficiencies, such as vitamin B1 (thiamine) or vitamin B12 deficiency.Guillain-Barre syndrome. Thyroid dysfunction (overactive or underactive thyroid). High blood sugar (diabetes) or low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Nutritional deficiencies, such as vitamin B1 (thiamine) or vitamin B12 deficiency. A sudden (acute) nervous system problem can cause many different symptoms, depending on the area of the nervous system involved. Stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) are common examples of acute problems. You may experience the sudden onset of one or more symptoms, such as: Numbness, tingling, weakness, or inability to move a part or all of one side of the body (paralysis). Dizziness, unsteadiness, or the inability to stand or walk, especially if other symptoms are present. Seizures can also cause sudden changes in consciousness, feeling (sensation), emotion, or thought. Abnormal body movements, such as muscle twitching, may or may not be present. Vertigo and dizziness are problems of balance and coordination (equilibrium). Vertigo is often caused by a medicine or a problem of the inner ear or brain. For more information, see the topic Dizziness: Lightheadedness and Vertigo. Most headaches are not caused by serious central nervous system problems. The pain that comes with a headache can range from a throbbing or a piercing pain, such as with a migraine, to severe pain that comes and goes over several days, such as with cluster headaches."], [1444, "Black Lung Disease", "Black lung disease is a common name for any lung disease that develops from inhaling coal dust. This name comes from the fact that those with the disease have lungs that look black instead of pink. Medically, it is a type of pneumoconiosis called coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP). There are two forms: simple CWP and complicated CWP, which also involves progressive massive fibrosis (PMF). The inhalation and accumulation of coal dust into the lungs increases the risk of developing chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The inhalation and accumulation of coal dust causes coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP). This stems from working in a coal mine, coal trimming (loading and stowing coal for storage), mining or milling graphite, and manufacturing carbon electrodes (used in certain types of large furnaces) and carbon black (a compound used in many items, such as tires and other rubber goods). Because CWP is a reaction to accumulated dust in the lungs, it may appear and get worse during your exposure to the dust or after your exposure has ceased. The severity of CWP depends on the type of coal dust, how much dust was in the air, and how long you have been exposed to it. Although CWP may share many of the symptoms of emphysema and/or chronic bronchitis (which are also known as COPD), CWP is not COPD and is not treated like COPD. CWP starts with the inhalation and accumulation of coal dust in the lungs. For many, there are no symptoms or noticeable effect on quality of life. There may be a cough and sputum (mucus) from inhalation of coal dust, but this may be more a matter of dust-induced bronchitis. As CWP progresses and is complicated by PMF, a cough and shortness of breath develop, along with sputum and moderate to severe airway obstruction. When coal dust accumulates in the lungs, a coal macule may form. As the disease progresses, macules can develop into a coal nodule, an abnormality of the lung tissue. have been accepted as evidence of progressive massive fibrosis (PMF), although some organizations say a minimum width of 2 cm (0.8 in.) Nodules may grow to a large size and hinder or stop the airflow in the lungs' airways. Occupational history is very important to the diagnosis of CWP-if a person has not been exposed to coal dust, he or she cannot have CWP. For information on organizations dealing with mining and black lung disease, see the Other Places to Get Help section of this topic."], [1445, "Black Eye", "A ''black eye'' is a bruise to the eyelid skin caused by blunt trauma to the eye region. Any damage to the eyeball that causes it to become red and swollen must be promptly evaluated by a doctor or an eye specialist. Blunt force eye injuries, as happens in fighting, competitive sports, and ordinary accidents, could involve an unsuspected detached retina, internal bleeding, or other serious problems. An orbital fracture involving one of the five delicate bones around the eye may trap an eye muscle or soft tissues. A fracture could also damage the optic nerve and permanently damage eyesight. Most black eyes are the result of blunt trauma that causes bleeding beneath the thin eyelid skin, producing the characteristic black and blue discoloration."], [1446, "Biting", "Most children younger than age 3 bite someone else at least once. Biting that happens past age 3 or that occurs frequently at any age may need treatment. Biting isn't always intentional, and a bite from a child rarely causes serious injury to another person or poses any health risks. Children bite other people for different reasons, depending on their age. From 5 to 7 months of age, children may bite when they feel discomfort around their mouths, such as when they are teething. From 8 to 14 months of age, children may bite when they are excited. Most often they bite a caregiver or another child close to them. From 15 to 36 months of age, children may bite when they are frustrated or want power or control over another person. After age 3, children may bite when they feel powerless or scared, such as when they are losing a fight or think that someone is going to hurt them. Biting at this age may be a sign that a child has problems with expressing feelings or self-control. Biting occurs in a variety of situations, most often when many children are together, such as at day care. Most biting can be prevented when adults help children find better ways to express their feelings. A child of any age who frequently bites other children may need special arrangements for day care. If biting becomes an ongoing problem, parents may be asked to take their child out of a day care center. Biting in young children usually doesn't lead to behavior problems at a later age. But children who bite others often and act aggressively in other ways, especially if they are older than age 3, may have health problems or emotional issues. For children ages 8 to 14 months, tell them that biting hurts other people. (Children this age are often not aware that bites hurt.) For children ages 15 to 36 months, help them find other ways to express their feelings. You may be able to stop the biting before it happens if you can distract or redirect your child. Don't try to reason with young children or have long talks about biting. Don't pinch, slap, or use other physical punishment."], [1447, "Birthmarks", "A birthmark is a colored mark on or under a newborn baby's skin. Some kinds of birthmarks fade or go away as a child gets older. They can be any size or shape and can be different colors, such as blue or blue-gray, brown, tan, black, pink, white, red, or purple. Some birthmarks are smooth, and some are raised or lumpy. But it's important to have a doctor check all birthmarks, just to be sure they are okay. Some birthmarks are from extra color (pigment) in the skin. Other birthmarks are blood vessels that are bunched together or don't grow normally. Salmon patches (also called stork bites, angel kisses, and macular stains). Salmon patches are thin, flat, light pink or red birthmarks. They tend to be on the back of the neck, the upper eyelids, upper lip, or between the eyebrows. Most cafe-au-lait spots are smooth, oval birthmarks. They range in color from light brown to chocolate brown and usually are found on the torso, buttocks, and legs. Mongolian spots are smooth, blue or blue-gray birthmarks. They are often uneven in shape and are on the lower back and buttocks. Hemangiomas are raised birthmarks. They are clumps of blood vessels that didn't grow normally. They may grow only on the skin, or they may extend deeper into the body. Port-wine stains are birthmarks that are pink-red at birth and then become a darker red-purple. They can be small, or they can cover a large area of the body. Most birthmarks are harmless and need no treatment. But in rare cases, birthmarks need treatment because they are growing quickly, growing on an internal organ, or causing a medical problem (such as a problem with sight, breathing, hearing, speech, or movement). There are several ways to fade, shrink, or remove birthmarks. Your options will depend on the type of birthmark, where it is, and what problems it's causing. The treatments may not work, and they can be painful and cause side effects. If a birthmark upsets your child, it may help to have your child talk with a trusted doctor. If you see a birthmark on your baby, make sure that a doctor has seen it. If a birthmark grows, bleeds, hurts, or gets infected, see a doctor to have it checked."], [1448, "Birth Defects Testing", "When you're pregnant, prenatal tests give you information about your health and your baby's. They help detect any problems that could affect him, like birth defects or genetic diseases. The results can help you make the best health care decisions before and after your child is born. Prenatal tests are helpful, but it's important to know how to interpret what they find. A positive test result doesn't always mean your baby will be born with a disorder. You'll want to talk with your doctor, midwife, or other health care provider about what the tests mean and what you should do once you have the results. Doctors recommend some prenatal tests for all pregnant women. Only some women will need other screening tests to check for certain genetic problems. There are different prenatal tests you can get in your first, second, and third trimester. Some check your health, and others get information about your baby. Your health care provider will check samples of your blood and urine for certain conditions, including: HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases Anemia Diabetes Hepatitis B Preeclampsia, a type of high blood pressure She'll also check your blood type and whether your blood cells have a protein called the Rh factor. This usually happens in the last month before you give birth. If your pregnancy is normal, you'll have it twice, once near the beginning to see how far along you are, and the second time around 18-20 weeks to check your baby's growth and make sure his organs are developing properly. Doctors also can use prenatal tests to look for signs that your baby is at risk for certain genetic disorders or birth defects. You don't have to have these tests, but your doctor may suggest some to make sure your baby is healthy. They're especially important for women who have a higher risk of having a baby with a birth defect or a genetic problem.This is you if you: Are over age 35 Have had a premature baby or a baby with a birth defect before Have a genetic disorder or one that runs in your family or the other parent's family Have a medical condition like diabetes, high blood pressure, a seizure disorder, or an autoimmune disorder such as lupus Have had miscarriages or stillborn babies in the past Have had gestational diabetes or preeclampsia when you were pregnant before Some prenatal genetic tests are screening tests. They tell you if your baby has a higher risk of having a certain disorder or disease, but they can't tell you for certain that he'll be born with it. Usually, you'll get this kind after you have a positive result on a screening test. To start, your doctor may want to test you and the child's other parent for the genes that cause certain genetic diseases, like cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs disease, sickle cell disease, and others. If both of you have a gene for one of these diseases in your DNA, you could pass it on to your baby, even if you don't have the disease itself. Your doctor can use one or more different screening tests to check your baby for a genetic problem, including: Ultrasound. You'll already have one of these early in your pregnancy to make sure everything is going well. Around 11-14 weeks, doctors can use it to look at the back of your baby's neck. Folds or thick skin there could mean a higher risk of Down syndrome. Your doctor also may take a sample of your blood at the same time. In the first part, doctors combine the results of the ultrasound looking at your baby's neck and the blood tests you got at 11-14 weeks. The results measure your baby's risk for Down syndrome and spina bifida, a spinal cord and brain disorder. This is similar to integrated screening, but your doctor reviews the results with you right after the first phase at 11-14 weeks. It's not as accurate as the longer test, but it lets you know your baby's risk earlier. If the screening finds there may be a problem, your doctor will use more tests to find out for sure. If it doesn't find a risk, you'll most likely get the second blood test at 16-18 weeks to be safe. Doctors check your blood for hormones and proteins that come from your baby or your placenta, the organ that brings him oxygen and nutrients. The test can look for three different substances (triple screening) or four (quadruple screening). Certain amounts of these mean your baby has a higher chance of having a birth defect or a genetic disease. Doctors use this test to find your baby's DNA in your blood and check it for Down syndrome and two other genetic conditions, trisomy 18 and trisomy 13. If you get a positive result on a screening, your doctor can use other tests to look for a problem. Using a thin needle in your belly, your doctor will take a sample of the fluid that surrounds your baby and check it for genetic disorders or birth defects. They test the sample for Down syndrome and other genetic conditions. Only some high-risk women will need this test, usually if a screening found a risk of a birth defect. The procedure will tell you for sure if there's a problem, but it also comes with a risk of miscarriage that's similar to amniocentesis. But it's important to remember that many of them tell you it's possible, but not certain, that your baby will be born with a disorder. A genetics counselor can also help you decide what to do after a positive result and what life will be like for your child if he has a disorder. Will anyone else (like my insurance company) have access to the results, especially of genetic tests?"], [1449, "Bird Flu (Avian Influenza)", "Bird flu is an infection caused by a certain kind of avian influenza virus. Although there are many kinds of bird flu, the most common kinds that concern health workers are H5N1 and H7N9 bird flu viruses. Most of the time, wild birds don't get sick from the virus. But wild birds can easily pass the virus to birds that are being raised for food, such as chickens, ducks, and turkeys. Usually bird flu virus is not passed from birds to people. But since 1997, some people have become sick with this serious, deadly kind of bird flu. Most of these infections have been in Asian countries among people who have had close contact with birds raised on farms. After a wild bird infects a farm-raised bird, the virus can easily and quickly spread among hundreds or thousands of birds. People who come into contact with sick chickens, ducks, or turkeys are more likely to get the virus. You cannot get bird flu from eating fully cooked chicken, turkey, or duck, because heat kills the virus. In a few cases, bird flu was passed from one person to another person, not from a bird to a person. The bird flu virus can make people sicker than other kinds of flu viruses. Even though only a few hundred people are known to have been sick with bird flu, more than half of them have died. Experts also worry because the bird flu virus is so different from other flu viruses that our bodies do not have immunity against it. Not having immunity means that our bodies have a hard time fighting the virus. It also means that anyone, including those who are otherwise very healthy, can get seriously ill if he or she gets bird flu. At first, the symptoms of bird flu can be the same as common flu symptoms, such as: A fever. Sometimes bird flu also can cause other symptoms, such as: Vomiting or diarrhea. Bird flu can quickly progress to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, a serious lung problem that can be deadly. For the people who die from bird flu, the average length of time from the start of symptoms until death is 9 to 10 days.1 Call your doctor right away if you have traveled somewhere or live in an area where there is bird flu and you have a fever and a hard time breathing. If your doctor thinks that you may have bird flu, he or she will do a physical exam and ask you questions about your symptoms and past health. Your doctor will also ask where you live, where you have traveled recently, and if you have been near any birds. Then your doctor may order blood tests, nasal swabs, or other tests, such as X-rays, to help find out what is making you sick. Some questions your doctor might ask are: Have you been within 3 ft (1 m) of live, sick, or dead poultry, or with wild birds? Have you had close contact (touching or speaking distance) with someone from an area affected with a bird flu virus who has a severe respiratory illness or who later died from an unknown cause? Are you a lab or poultry worker who might have been exposed to a bird flu virus? How bird flu is treated depends on what the virus is doing to your body. If you have bird flu, you will stay in a private hospital room (isolation room) to reduce the chances of spreading the virus to others. Some people who have bird flu may need a machine called a ventilator to help them breathe better. More than half of the time, bird flu leads to death. The World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are preparing for the possibility that bird flu could spread to people all over the world in what is called a pandemic. This is a plan to prepare for a pandemic and to make sure that as few people as possible get the virus. Even though there is a lot of talk about bird flu, most people in the United States don't have to worry about getting it. As of January 2015, three cases of bird flu in humans had been reported in the U.S. and Canada. All of these cases were in people who got the disease while in China and then traveled to North America. If you live in an area with bird flu, or if you are traveling to a country where there is bird flu: Avoid poultry farms, poultry-processing factories or plants, and close contact with chickens, turkeys, or ducks.Stay away from open-air markets where live birds are sold. Stay away from open-air markets where live birds are sold. If you have been exposed to the virus, your doctor will watch you for signs of illness for 10 days. Your doctor may give you medicine to reduce your risk for getting the disease. If you are traveling to a country where there is bird flu, ask your doctor about getting a regular flu shot. These organizations are studying and keeping track of bird flu, including what is being done to prevent its spread."], [1450, "Bipolar Disorder in Child and Teens", "Although bipolar disorder more commonly develops in older teenagers and young adults, it can appear in children as young as 6. Another diagnosis, called Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) also has been established to describe children ages 6-18 who have severe and persistent irritability and temper outbursts that don't meet conventional definitions of bipolar disorder. If your child is diagnosed with bipolar disorder, you might want to get a second opinion before embarking on a treatment plan. Diagnosing bipolar disorder in young children is difficult, because many of the symptoms are similar to those of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or conduct disorders -- or even just normal, childhood behavior. One problem is that medications used for ADHD are often stimulants, which can potentially trigger mania in children with bipolar disorder. Young children in a manic phase might be more irritable than adults; they may be more likely to have psychotic symptoms, hearing and seeing things that aren't real. During a depressive episode, they might be more likely to complain of physical symptoms, like aches and pains. One of the most notable differences is that bipolar disorder in children cycles much more quickly. While manic and depressive periods may be separated by weeks, months, or years in adults, they can happen within a single day in children. As the parent of a child with bipolar disorder, there's a lot you can do to keep your child well. You absolutely must make sure that your child gets the medication he or she needs for bipolar disorder. Most drugs used for bipolar disorder were originally tested in adults, and only a few have been well-studied in children and adolescents. Children do seem to be more prone to side effects from some of these drugs, such as weight gain and changes in blood sugar and cholesterol caused by some atypical antipsychotics. The FDA has issued a warning that using some types of antidepressants or other medicines used to treat depression may increase the risk of suicide in children, adolescents and young adults up to 24 years old. In some cases, a child with bipolar disorder may need special allowances at school. In some cases, you may need to take your child out of school for a while, at least until his or her bipolar symptoms stabilize. Children with bipolar disorder can really benefit from a daily schedule. Help them get up, eat meals, exercise, and go to bed at roughly the same times each day. Having a child with bipolar disorder can be disruptive to the whole family. Your other children may not understand what's wrong with their sibling, or they may be resentful of all the attention he or she is getting. But unfortunately, it can happen, even with young children. So if your child begins to express a desire to die, or engages in life-threatening behavior, don't ignore it. In older teenagers, the symptoms and treatment of bipolar disorder are much more similar to those seen in adults. But having a teenager with this condition presents a lot of distinct problems. As with adults, it's key that teenagers with bipolar disorder avoid alcohol and drugs, which can interact with medications or bring on or worsen mood episodes. The risks of developing a substance abuse problem are much higher in teens with bipolar disorder than in their peers. It's also important to maintain regular routines around sleep and wake times, and to develop effective coping strategies for managing stress and distress."], [1451, "Biofeedback", "Biofeedback is a method that uses the mind to control a body function that the body normally regulates automatically, such as skin temperature, muscle tension, heart rate, or blood pressure. When you are first learning biofeedback, you will have sensors attached to your body and to a monitoring device. This provides instant feedback on a body function (for example, your skin temperature). The biofeedback therapist will then teach you physical and mental exercises that can help you control the function. The monitor beeps or flashes when you achieve the desired change in that body function (such as increasing skin temperature or reducing muscle tension). This type of biofeedback uses a device that measures muscle tension while you practice a relaxation technique, such as meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, or visualization. This type of biofeedback uses a device that measures the skin temperature of your hands while you try to increase it, often through visualization or guided imagery. For instance, you may listen to a tape that stirs images of blood flowing to your hands. Learning biofeedback requires several sessions in a biofeedback lab or other setting. With practice, many people may be able to learn to influence their muscle tension or blood flow without the help of the feedback monitor. People most often use biofeedback to control problems related to stress or blood flow, such as headaches, high blood pressure, and sleep disorders. The sensors placed on the skin to measure a body function may irritate your skin."], [1452, "Bioterrorism", "Public health threats are events or disasters that can affect you and your community.

Here are some things you can do to help prepare for a disaster: Learn about specific health threats and what you can do to reduce the risk to your health and safety. This topic helps you understand how health hazards can spread through a community and how you can limit your exposure to them. And know where to find first aid information in case of injuries. Always look to local authorities and health experts for specific, up-to-date information for your area. Following these steps can help you be better prepared for any type of public health threat. Chemicals, fumes, viruses, bacteria, and low-level radiation are just a few of them.

That's accompanied by no sense of control over eating behavior and followed by inappropriate methods for trying to lose weight, such as vomiting, fasting, enemas, excessive use of laxatives and diuretics, or compulsive exercising. People with bulimia often perform the behaviors in secret, feeling disgusted and ashamed when they binge, yet relieved once they purge. People with bulimia usually weigh within the normal range for their age and height. However, they may fear gaining weight, have desire to lose weight, and may feel intensely dissatisfied with their bodies. The exact cause of bulimia is not known, but research suggests that a combination of certain personality traits, emotions, and thinking patterns, as well as biological and environmental factors might be responsible. Researchers also believe that this eating disorder may begin with a dissatisfaction of the person's body and extreme concern with body size and shape. Symptoms of bulimia may include: Eating uncontrollably followed by purging Vomiting or abusing laxatives or diuretics in an attempt to lose weight Using the bathroom frequently after meals Excessive exercising Preoccupation with body weight Dental problems Sore throat Depression or mood swings Feeling out of control Swollen glands in neck and face Heartburn, indigestion, bloating Irregular periods Weakness, exhaustion, bloodshot eyes Complications of bulimia may include: Erosion of tooth enamel because of repeated exposure to acidic gastric contents Dental cavities Tooth sensitivity to hot or cold food Swelling and soreness in the salivary glands (from repeated vomiting) Stomach ulcers Ruptures of the stomach and esophagus Disruption in the normal bowel release function Dehydration Irregular heartbeat Heart attack (in severe cases) Lower libido (sex drive) Higher risk for suicidal behavior Bulimia treatment requires the consideration of the physical as well as the psychological needs of the person. The antidepressant fluoxetine (Prozac) is FDA-approved for the treatment of bulimia, and doctors sometimes recommend other antidepressants or types of medicines. The ideal outcome of treatment is to restore physical health and normal eating patterns. Many people improve, but relapses may recur from time to time in some cases. Because the true reason for the development of bulimia is not known, it is difficult to say how bulimia can be prevented. If you or any member of your family develops an unhealthy preoccupation with weight and size and/or appears unduly interested in food, you should consult a health care professional."], [1454, "Bilateral Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome", "One of the most common reasons a woman has trouble getting pregnant is a condition called polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). High levels of androgens interfere with the development of your eggs and the regular release of your eggs. If a healthy egg isn't released, it can't be fertilized by sperm, meaning you can't get pregnant. Your doctor may prescribe birth control pills that contain man-made versions of the hormones estrogen and progestin. If you cannot tolerate a combination birth control pill, your doctor might recommend a progestin-only pill. You take this pill for about 2 weeks a month, for about 1-2 months. But if you need help ovulating so that you can become pregnant, certain medicines may help: Clomiphene is an anti-estrogen drug that you take at the beginning of your cycle. If clomiphene doesn't help with ovulation, you may be prescribed the diabetes drug metformin. If clomiphene and metformin don't work, your doctor may prescribe a medication containing a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and a luteinizing hormone (LH). If you have PCOS and you want to get pregnant, you should work with a doctor who is a specialist in reproductive medicine. This type of doctor is also known as a fertility specialist. A specialist will help make sure you get the right dose of medicines, help with any problems you have, and schedule regular checkups and ultrasounds to see how you're doing.

A low thyroid level (hypothyroidism) can cause fatigue, weakness, lethargy, weight gain, depression, memory problems, constipation, dry skin, intolerance to cold, coarse and thinning hair, brittle nails, or a yellowish tint to the skin. A high thyroid level (hyperthyroidism) can cause fatigue, weight loss, increased heart rate, intolerance to heat, sweating, irritability, anxiety, muscle weakness, and thyroid enlargement. Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare nerve disorder that causes weakness in the legs, arms, and other muscles and that can progress to complete paralysis. Myasthenia gravis, a rare, chronic disorder that causes weakness and rapid muscle fatigue. Sudden muscle weakness and loss of function in one area of the body can indicate a serious problem within the brain (such as a stroke or transient ischemic attack) or spinal cord or with a specific nerve in the body. Any illness, such as a cold or the flu, may cause fatigue, which usually goes away as the illness clears up. Most of the time, mild fatigue occurs with a health problem that will improve with home treatment and does not require a visit to a doctor. Many prescription and nonprescription medicines can cause weakness or fatigue. The use or abuse of alcohol, caffeine, or illegal drugs can cause fatigue. A visit to a doctor usually is needed when fatigue occurs along with more serious symptoms, such as increased breathing problems, signs of a serious illness, abnormal bleeding, or unexplained weight loss or gain. This type of fatigue may be caused by a more serious health problem, such as: A decrease in the amount of oxygen-carrying substance (hemoglobin) found in red blood cells (anemia). Problems with the heart, such as coronary artery disease or heart failure, that limit the supply of oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle or the rest of the body. A low thyroid level (hypothyroidism) can cause fatigue, weakness, lethargy, weight gain, depression, memory problems, constipation, dry skin, intolerance to cold, coarse and thinning hair, brittle nails, or a yellowish tint to the skin.A high thyroid level (hyperthyroidism) can cause fatigue, weight loss, increased heart rate, intolerance to heat, sweating, irritability, anxiety, muscle weakness, and thyroid enlargement.

Kidney disease and liver disease, which cause fatigue when the concentration of certain chemicals in the blood builds up to toxic levels. Fatigue is a common symptom of mental health problems, such as anxiety or depression. If you think your fatigue may be caused by a mental health problem, see your doctor."], [1462, "Batten Turner Congenital Myopathy", "Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy is an extremely rare, inherited muscle disease (myopathy) and is characterized by the lack of muscle tone or floppiness at birth (congenital hypotonia). The symptoms of Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy are slowly progressive during infancy and childhood."], [1463, "Birth Control Choosing a Birth Control Method", "With so many methods available and so many factors to consider, choosing birth control can be difficult. You may be able to decide on a method by asking yourself the following questions: One of your first considerations might be to determine whether you want permanent or temporary birth control. If you know that you will not ever want to conceive a pregnancy, tubal ligation or tubal implants for you or a vasectomy for your partner is a reasonable option to consider. If an unplanned pregnancy would seriously impact your plans for the future, choose a birth control method that is highly effective. Or if you have a stable relationship and income and plan to have children in the future anyway, you may feel comfortable using a less reliable method. Consider how important it is to you to avoid pregnancy, and then look at how well each birth control method works. Barrier methods such as condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides are only moderately effective. To be effective, birth control pills require you to take a pill every day. If you are not willing to put in the effort, choose another method of birth control. Consider how comfortable you feel about using a particular method of birth control. If you are not comfortable with or might not consistently use a birth control method for any reason, that method is not likely to be reliable for you in the long run. Unless you know that your partner has no other sex partners and is free of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), you are at risk for STI infection. Use a condom in addition to any other birth control method you choose. You can choose between a male or female condom to reduce your risk for HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, genital warts, herpes, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and other infections. If you have health problems or other risk factors, some birth control methods may not be right for you. If you smoke more than 15 cigarettes a day and are 35 or older or have high blood pressure, a history of stroke, a history of blood clots, liver disease, or heart disease, you may not be able to use combined hormonal methods. If you have advanced or long-standing diabetes, discuss the risks of taking hormonal birth control methods with your health professional. Progestin-only pills, an implant, both kinds of IUDs, or birth control shots do not affect your milk supply and are a good option for breastfeeding women. Other health problems that might keep you from using a particular birth control method are relatively rare, especially in young women. But before using any method, talk with your health professional to see if it is safe for you. Other things to consider when choosing a method of birth control include: Health benefits, such as decreased risk of sexually transmitted infections with condoms and reduced risk of ovarian cancer and uterine cancer with use of birth control pills for one year or longer. Birth control forms such as patches, shots, implants, IUDs, and vaginal rings are convenient for women who have trouble remembering to take a daily pill or couples who know they won't use a barrier method every time they have sex. Over time, the higher one-time cost of IUD insertion or sterilization surgery may be less than the continued costs of buying pills or condoms and spermicide. The amount of time it takes for a woman's full fertility to return after stopping birth control varies for each woman and depends on the birth control method she is using. Some birth control methods may have a greater risk of causing certain health problems. For example, hormonal birth control usually has more risks and side effects than barrier methods. Thinking about the pros and cons of hormonal birth control methods may help you choose the one that is best for you. Using condoms with any method may increase its reliability and helps to protect you from sexually transmitted infections (STIs)."], [1464, "Birth Control Questions to Ask Your Doctor", "Your doctor or pharmacist can help you get answers about emergency contraception. Some products work for about 3 days after, some for 5. Your doctor or pharmacist can steer you in the right direction. Many women don't know it's available, but the implantable copper-T IUD works well as emergency contraception. Some meds and supplements -- like the epilepsy drug Dilantin, antibiotics such as rifampicin or griseofulvin, and St. John's wort -- can stop emergency contraception pills from working normally. To be safe, tell your doctor or pharmacist about other drugs and supplements you take. Emergency birth-control pills and the IUD are safe for almost all women. But if you have medical problems and you're concerned that taking emergency contraception could be risky, talk to a doctor or pharmacist. The pills may not work as well for women who weigh over 165 pounds. If you're overweight, Ella may work better than Plan B One-Step and generic levonorgestrel. In general, the IUD seems to work better than pills for heavier women. Emergency contraception lasts only for about 24 hours and may just delay ovulation, not stop it. Some types of emergency contraception may not be safe if you're already pregnant. Find out what your choices are and compare the costs."], [1465, "Birth Control Tubal Ligation", "Tubal ligation is surgery women can get to \"tie\" their fallopian tubes. The goal is to prevent eggs from traveling from the ovaries to the uterus, so you can't get pregnant. You can get tubal ligation done in a hospital or at an outpatient surgical clinic. The surgeon will make one or two small cuts in your belly and use a long, thin device similar to a small telescope (called a laparoscope) to cut, seal, band, clamp, or tie your fallopian tubes shut. The doctor will then stitch up your cuts, and you can go home a few hours later. Like any procedure, there is a chance of infection, pain, or bleeding. That can happen if the tubes grow back together, which is very rare. It depends on what method of tubal ligation you got, how long ago that was, and whether your tubes are too damaged to undo it. Reversing a tubal ligation increases your likelihood of an ectopic pregnancy when compared to patients who have not had previous tubal surgery. An ectopic pregnancy occurs when the fertilized egg is in the fallopian tube instead of in the uterus. Male condoms provide the best protection from most sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV."], [1466, "Birth Control Permanent Birth Control", "Birth control, like sterilization, is a way for men and women to prevent pregnancy. Sterilization is a permanent form of birth control that is extremely effective at preventing pregnancy. But it is difficult to reverse if you change your mind, and it does not protect against STDs. For women, a tubal ligation is performed; for men, a vasectomy is performed. Women have the option of tubal ligation surgery or the placement of a device called Essure. Essure is a form of permanent sterilization for women that is hormone-free. Placement of the device is a procedure done in the doctor's office without the need for general anesthesia (being put to sleep). Because the scarring occurs over time, women should take another form of birth control for three months after the procedure. After a few months, the doctor will take a special X-ray to verify that the fallopian tubes are blocked and you can rely on the inserts for birth control. These can include changes in their monthly period, pain in the lower belly, or allergic reactions to the metal in the coil. Sterilization does not protect against STDs, including HIV (the virus that causes AIDS). Tubal ligation is performed in a hospital or outpatient surgical clinic while you are anesthetized (put to sleep). One or two small incisions (cuts) are made in the abdomen, and a device similar to a small telescope (called a laparoscope) is inserted. The fallopian tubes are cut, tied, clamped, banded or sealed shut. The patient is able to return home within a few hours after the procedure. Tubal ligation can also be performed immediately after childbirth through a small incision near the navel or during a cesarean delivery. An estimated 700,000 American women undergo tubal ligation each year, making it the most common form of contraception in the U.S. Tubal ligation is performed in a hospital or outpatient surgical clinic while you are anesthetized (put to sleep). One or two small incisions (cuts) are made in the abdomen, and a device similar to a small telescope (called a laparoscope) is inserted. Using instruments that are inserted through the laparoscope, the fallopian tubes are cut, tied, clamped, banded or sealed shut. The patient is able to return home within a few hours after the procedure. Tubal ligation can also be performed immediately after childbirth through a small incision near the navel or during a cesarean delivery. Sterilization does not protect against STDs, including HIV (the virus that causes AIDS). A vasectomy, or male sterilization, is a simple, permanent sterilization procedure for men. The operation, usually done in a doctor's office, requires cutting and sealing or blocking the vas deferens, the tubes in the male reproductive system that carry sperm. There will still be a fluid ejaculate, but there will be no sperm in the fluid. Vasectomy does not protect against STDs, including HIV (the virus that causes AIDS). A vasectomy is usually done in the surgeon's office while the man is awake, but is relatively pain-free since local anesthesia is used. The tubes (vas deferens) that carry sperm are tied off and cut apart, burned or blocked with surgical clips. In a \"no-scalpel\" vasectomy, the doctor feels for the vas deferens under the skin of the scrotum and holds it in place with a small clamp. Then a special instrument is used to make a tiny puncture in the skin and stretch the opening so the vas deferens can be cut and tied. You can resume sexual activity within a few days after a vasectomy, but birth control should be used until a test shows that your semen is free of sperm. If sperm are still present in the semen, you will be asked to return at a later date for a repeat test. Once sperm are absent from the ejaculate, other forms of contraception may be discontinued. Due to a process known as spontaneous recanalization (tubes rejoining), pregnancies may occur after vasectomy, although this is very rare. The chief disadvantage of a vasectomy is its permanence, although this is also considered the chief advantage. The procedure itself is simple, but reversing it is difficult, expensive, and can be unsuccessful. But, it is possible to store semen in a sperm bank to preserve the possibility of producing a pregnancy at some future date. However, doing this is costly, and the sperm in stored semen do not always remain viable (able to cause pregnancy). For all of these reasons, doctors advise that a vasectomy be undertaken only by men who are prepared to accept the fact that they will no longer be able to father a child. Men who are married or in a serious relationship should also discuss the issue with their partners. Although it is extremely effective for preventing pregnancy, a vasectomy does not offer protection against AIDS or other STDs. Consequently, it is important that vasectomized men continue to use condoms, preferably latex, which offer considerable protection against the spread of disease. Another disadvantage is the immune reactions to sperm that some men develop after a vasectomy, although current evidence indicates that these reactions do not cause any harm. A vasectomy does not affect the production or release of testosterone, the male hormone responsible for a man's sex drive, beard, deep voice, and other masculine traits. The most current research shows that a vasectomy does not increase a man's risk of developing prostate cancer and that this concern should not be a reason to avoid having one."], [1467, "Birth Control Birth Control Myths", "There are a number of birth control methods that are highly effective in preventing pregnancy. There is also a lot of misinformation about how to use contraception, as well as some methods that simply do not work. Following are some common myths about birth control: I'm breastfeeding so I can't get pregnant. A woman of childbearing age usually releases an egg each month as part of her regular menstrual cycle (called ovulation). After ejaculation, the sperm enter the cervix and are out of reach of any douching solution. Myths such as these most likely arise from a lack of understanding of the menstrual cycle. There are four major hormones (chemicals that stimulate or regulate the activity of cells or organs) involved in the menstrual cycle: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estrogen, and progesterone. A delicate balance of these hormones regulates ovulation, and if the egg is not fertilized, menstruation occurs. While a woman's cycle is more or less regular at most times, this balance of hormones can be disrupted by various factors, including age, weight, stress, medications, and others. Therefore, pinpointing the time of ovulation and predicting any \"safe\" days can be difficult. Couples who have success with the rhythm method of contraception must carefully monitor the women's menstrual cycles and evaluate symptoms of ovulation, as well as any external factors. Some people believe that having sex in certain positions, such as standing up, will force the sperm out of the woman's vagina. In truth, positions during sex have nothing to do with whether or not fertilization occurs. The sperm will, by nature, begin to move up through the cervical canal immediately after ejaculation. Condoms are specifically made to provide a good fit and good protection during sex, and they are thoroughly tested for maximum effectiveness. Pulling out before the man ejaculates, known as the withdrawal method, is not a foolproof method for contraception. Some ejaculate (fluid that contains sperm) may be released before the man actually begins to climax. I won't get pregnant if I take a shower or bath right after sex, or if I urinate right after sex. Washing or urinating after sex will not stop the sperm that have already entered the uterus through the cervix. In some women, one complete menstrual cycle is needed for the hormones in the pill (oral contraceptive) to work with the woman's natural hormones to prevent ovulation. Some doctors recommend using a back-up method of birth control the first month of taking the pill."], [1468, "Birth Control Emergency Contraception", "Emergency contraception -- also called postcoital contraception -- is a form of birth control that may be used by women who have had unprotected sex or used a birth control method that failed. Emergencies include being raped, having a condom break or slip off during sex, or missing two or more birth control pills during a monthly cycle. Emergency oral contraception is used to prevent a pregnancy, not end one. Emergency contraception does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. It is not RU-466, the medication used to induce abortions. Plan B One-Step is a specifically packaged emergency contraception. It is available to anyone over the counter without a prescription or age restrictions. It contains ulipristal, a non-hormonal drug that blocks the effects of key hormones necessary for conception. Plan B One-Step emergency contraception may prevent pregnancy by temporarily blocking eggs from being released, by stopping fertilization, or by keeping a fertilized egg from becoming implanted in the uterus. Plan B One-Step is taken in one dose with one pill. When Plan B One-Step is taken as directed, it can reduce the chance of pregnancy by close to 90%. The device works by stopping implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus within 5 to 7 days after unprotected intercourse. However, research shows that Plan B One-Step starts to lose its effectiveness in women heavier than 165 pounds and is not recommend for anyone over this weight. In two reported studies, Ella significantly reduced the pregnancy rate from an expected rate of 5.5% and 5.6% to 2.2% and 1.9%, respectively. In a pooled analysis of the data, the effectiveness did not fade for 120 hours after unprotected sex. An IUD can be up to 99% effective when inserted within 5 to 7 days after unprotected intercourse. Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) are available at Planned Parenthood; college, public, and women's health centers; private doctors; and some hospital emergency rooms. Some doctors will prescribe ECPs over the phone and call the prescription in to a pharmacy. The most common side effects associated with emergency contraception pills include: Nausea Abdominal pain Fatigue Headache Menstrual changes Ask your doctor or pharmacist about ways to reduce nausea. Emergency contraception will not protect you from contracting an STD, such as HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. The best way to avoid getting STDs is to limit sexual contact to one uninfected partner."], [1469, "Birth Control Vasectomy", "A vasectomy is an operation for a man, so that their partner can't get pregnant. The procedure, which you can get done in a doctor's office without being \"asleep,\" stops sperm from being able to leave the testes. With no sperm entering the woman, she won't get pregnant. Keep in mind that sperm can still get out for a little while right after a vasectomy. So be sure to get the follow-up test that checks on that, so you know when you can stop using another method of birth control just in case. Some men get a \"no-scalpel\" vasectomy, which uses very small holes instead of cuts and doesn't require stitches. But you can expect to recover completely in less than a week. Many men have the procedure on a Friday and return to work on Monday. Give it a few days, and use birth control until you get a test that shows that your semen is free of sperm. You can get this test after you've had 10-20 ejaculations after the vasectomy. If the results show that you still have sperm in your semen, your doctor will ask you to come back at a later date to take the test again. But reversing a vasectomy isn't easy and doesn't always work. So you shouldn't get the procedure unless you're sure you won't want to be able to get a woman pregnant in your future. These are almost never serious, but tell your doctor if you have symptoms. The American Cancer Society says that some studies have suggested that men who have vasectomies may be slightly more likely than other men to get prostate cancer, but that other studies haven't found such a link. The most current findings show that a vasectomy does not raise a man's risk of getting prostate cancer, and that this concern should not be a reason to avoid having one. You'll still want to use a male condom for the best protection against HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases."], [1470, "Binge Eating Disorder Symptoms of Binge Eating Disorder", "Most people overeat from time to time, and many people believe they frequently eat more than they should.

Your doctor can also test you for other problems that may be related to your bingeing, like depression or anxiety, and weight-related issues like high blood pressure. Catching these things early can help prevent complications. If you don't want to discuss your bingeing with your primary care doctor, contact a psychologist or psychiatrist who specializes in eating disorders.

This might be needed if you have other serious health problems that are related to your binge eating disorder, like severe depression or suicidal thoughts. Connecting with other people who also have binge eating disorder can be helpful. You can do this by attending group therapy, finding an online support group, or even just chatting regularly with someone else who's going through treatment.

Nearly half of all people with binge eating disorder have a history of depression, although the exact nature of the link is unclear. Eating disorders, including binge eating disorder, can sometimes run in families, suggesting that a susceptibility to eating disorders might be inherited. People with binge eating disorder often come from families that overeat or put an unnatural emphasis on food; for example, they may use food as a reward or as a way to soothe or comfort, leading to binge eating as a learned behavioral response to stress. Binge eating also sometimes can be an undesirable side effect of certain psychiatric or other medications that stimulate appetite and may interfere with people being able to sense when they are full after eating a meal. Although it might not be possible to prevent all cases of binge eating disorder, it is helpful to begin treatment in people as soon as they begin to have symptoms."], [1475, "Binge Eating Disorder Symptoms", "It's midnight and you've just eaten a party-sized bag of chips, four slices of leftover pizza, and half a tray of brownies.

You might have it if you eat a very large amount of food -- more than other people would eat -- in a short amount of time (about a 2-hour period) at least 1 day a week for 3 months. Other signs of BED include: Secret behavior:You binge when you're alone. This may be late at night or in the parking lot of a fast food restaurant. You may \"get rid of the evidence\" and hide wrappers or food containers. Food hoarding:You may stockpile bags of chips or cookies in your closet or under your bed. Lack of control:You have no power over how much you eat or when to stop. Abnormal eating pattern:You may eat lightly throughout the day without set meal times. Or you eat a small bit at meals or skip them all together. Food rituals: You may chew too much or not let foods touch on a plate. You might only eat certain foods or groups -- eating only yogurt, for example. Other internal symptoms include: Mood disorders: Half of people with BED are depressed or have a history of depression. You may also be moody, irritable, or not want to be around other people. Trouble coping: People with BED often have a hard time with things like anger, boredom, and stress. You're more at risk if you have these personality traits: You're a people pleaser and avoid conflicts.

You may eat a lot, quickly, even if you're not hungry. Talking with a specialist (such as a psychiatrist or psychologist) who treats people with eating disorders is key. It helps to have emotional support from family and friends, too. Experts don't know why some people develop binge eating disorder. In the U.S. about 3.5% of women (5.6 million) and 2% of men (3.1 million) have it. People who are obese are at a higher risk of getting binge eating disorder, although people of normal weight can also get it. If you have binge eating disorder, you may have trouble handling your emotions or feel out of control in other ways. Skipping meals and other severe dieting may trigger a backlash of binge eating. Some people with binge eating disorder have gone through emotional or physical abuse, or had addictions, such as alcoholism. If that sounds like you, getting help with those issues will be part of getting better. If you have binge eating disorder, you: Eat more food than other people do in the same situation. Feel upset after you binge. Have an eating binge at least once a week for 3 months, on average. You also have three or more of these symptoms: Eat much more quickly than normal. People with binge eating disorder don't try to throw up after overeating. You can get other health problems related to gaining weight or unhealthy eating, too, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease. You also may have trouble sleeping, muscle and joint pain, and digestive problems. Your doctor may ask you questions such as: Once you start eating, can you stop? In order to get diagnosed, though, you need to be open with your doctor. Your doctor may consider binge eating mild if it happens 1-3 times a week, moderate if it happens 4-7 times a week, severe if it happens 8-13 times a week, or extreme if it happens 14 or more times a week. Have you worked with many people with binge eating disorder? Beating binge eating disorder is not about willpower. Sometimes medications such as lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) will be prescribed to suppress the desire to binge eat. It is the first FDA-approved drug to treat moderate to severe binge eating by curbing the binge eating episodes. You also need the help of a specialist, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist. It can help you change your thoughts about eating and understand what triggers your binges. Your therapist may suggest that you include your family in counseling so they can learn about the disorder, spot sources of stress at home, and know how to support you. Ask your doctor or therapist about finding a support group in your area. It can help to talk to other people who know what you're going through. You also may need help with other conditions, such as depression or anxiety. A doctor may prescribe an antidepressant, a drug to help manage the urge to binge (such as the anti-seizure drug topiramate), or other medications. A new medication, naltrexone hcl/bupropion hcl (Contrave), helps with weight loss. Feeling stressed makes it more likely that you'll binge eat, so you'll need positive ways to manage that. Yoga, meditation, exercise, and massage therapy can help you feel calm. Ask your doctor or therapist to recommend a nutritional counselor who can teach you about healthy eating. You need your doctor's advice on how to lose extra weight without triggering binge eating. If you feel stuck in a cycle of binge eating, take heart: Most people can overcome this disorder with treatment. People with binge eating disorder often blame themselves. Those bumps in the road aren't unusual as you gradually gain more control over your eating. You can find support groups, doctor referrals, and other information from the Binge Eating Disorder Association, the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), and the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders (ANAD).

It's a newer version of the implant Implanon. Your doctor or another health care provider will inject medicine to numb your skin on your upper arm, where you'll get the implant. Afterward, you should be able to feel the implant under your skin, but not see it. You can use a birth control implant for up to 3 years. Your health care provider numbs your skin and makes a tiny cut near the tip of the implant, then pulls it out. If you doctor can't feel it under the skin, an X-ray can show if it's in the right place. As with any type of birth control method, implants have both pros and cons. Fewer than 1 in 100 women using an implant will become pregnant each year. Unlike some other birth control options -- such as condoms, patches, shots, rings, and pills -- the implant works no matter what. You don't have to worry about using it incorrectly or remembering to replace or take it often. If you want to get pregnant, you can get started on that right after you get the implant taken out. In studies of women using implants, painful periods got better. Potential disadvantages of birth control implants include: Cost. You may have to pay about $600 or more for an exam and the implant, and $100 or more to have it removed. No protection against STD s. Unlike some other forms of birth control, such as condoms, birth control implants won't prevent HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases. Possible side effects include problems from the insertion procedure, such as: Pain Bruising or swelling Redness Infection Scarring Other possible side effects include: Irregular menstrual bleeding Depression and other mood changes Weight gain Abdominal pain or nausea Acne Breast pain, back pain, or headache Vaginitis Dizziness Some women shouldn't use birth control implants, including women who may already be pregnant and those with: Sensitivity to any part of the implant Unexplained vaginal bleeding Breast cancer (now or in the past) Liver disease or liver tumors History of blood clots (deep vein thrombosis) Use with caution if you have: Diabetes High cholesterol Seizure disorder You've ever had depression Also, it's not clear if the implants are as effective if you're obese. Some medications can make birth control implants less effective."], [1478, "Birth Control Birth Control Pills", "Birth control is a way for men and women to prevent pregnancy. There are many different methods of birth control, including hormonal contraception such as \"the pill.\" Women take the pill by mouth to prevent pregnancy, and, when taken correctly, it is up to 99.9% effective. However, the pill does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV (the virus that causes AIDS). Other types of combined estrogen and progestin hormonal contraception include the patch and the vaginal ring. A woman becomes pregnant when an egg released from her ovary (the organ that holds her eggs) is fertilized by a man's sperm. The fertilized egg attaches to the inside of a woman's womb (uterus), where it receives nourishment and develops into a baby. Hormones in the woman's body control the release of the egg from the ovary -- called ovulation -- and prepare the body to accept the fertilized egg. Hormonal contraceptives (the pill, the patch, and the vaginal ring) all contain a small amount of man-made estrogen and progestin hormones. Seasonale contains the same hormones as other birth control pills, but the hormones are taken in a longer cycle. Seasonale contains the same combination of two hormones that are commonly used in other hormonal contraceptives. But the pill is taken continuously for 12 weeks followed by one week of inactive pills, which results in a menstrual cycle. Other extended-cycle pills, such as Seasonique and LoSeasonique use a different configuration of the same hormones. Both of these pills use estrogen in the final week, with LoSeasonique providing a lower dose option. They do not contain estrogen and may be prescribed in women who are breastfeeding or in women who experience nausea or other side effects of estrogen. The hormone in the pills also changes the lining of the uterus, so that implantation of a fertilized egg is much less likely to occur. In some cases, mini pills prevent the release of an egg. If mini pills are used consistently and correctly, they are about 95% effective -- somewhat less effective than standard birth control pills. Pill packs containing regular birth control pills have either 21 or 28 pills. Twenty-eight day pill packs contain 21 active pills and seven inactive (placebo) pills. Some newer pills have only 2 inactive pills or even no inactive pills in the pack. A package of extended-cycle Seasonale contains 84 active pink tablets and seven inactive white pills. With Seasonique and LoSeasonique, the last 7 pills contain estrogen only. If you are still having your period on the day that you have been told to start your pill pack, go ahead and start the pill pack anyway. Then depending on the type of pill you're taking, you have seven days of taking one placebo or estrogen only pill per day. You will start each new birth control pill pack on the same day of the week that you initially started it. If you are on the 28-day pill pack, begin the new pack after taking the last pill in the old pack. When taken as directed, birth control pills are usually effective the first month you begin taking them. To be safe, some doctors recommend the use of another form of birth control, such as condoms and foam, during the first month. After the first month, you can just rely on the pill for birth control. If you forget to take a birth control pill, take it as soon as you remember. If you don't remember until the next day, go ahead and take two pills that day. If you forget to take your pills for two days, take two pills the day you remember and two pills the next day. You may be told to take one pill daily until Sunday then start a new pill pack or to discard the rest of the pill pack and start over with a new pack that same day. Any time you forget to take a pill, you must use another form of birth control until you finish the pill pack. If you miss your period and have forgotten to take one or more active pills, get a pregnancy test. It is very important to take the mini pills (progestin only) at the exact same time each day. If you miss a pill or are more than three hours late for a pill you should take the pill as soon as you remember and use a backup method (such as a condom or spermicide) for the next 48 hours. Yes, there are side effects of birth control pills, although the majority are not serious. Side effects include: Nausea Weight gain Sore or swollen breasts Small amounts of blood, or spotting, between periods Lighter periods Mood changes The following side effects, easily remembered by the word \"ACHES,\" are less common but more serious. If you cannot reach your doctor, go to an emergency room or urgent care center for evaluation. These symptoms may indicate a serious disorder, such as liver disease, gallbladder disease, stroke, blood clots, high blood pressure, or heart disease. They include: Abdominal pain (stomach pain) Chest pain Headaches (severe) Eye problems (blurred vision) Swelling or aching in the legs and thighs Birth control pills that contain drospirenone, including YAZ and Yasmin, have been investigated by the FDA because of the possibility that they may cause an increased risk for blood clots. Other brands containing drospirenone include Beyaz, Safyral, Gianvi, Loryna, Ocella, Syeda, and Zarah. Birth control pills can be taken safely by most women. In addition, you should not take hormonal contraceptives if you have had: Blood clots in the arms, legs, or lungs Serious heart or liver disease Cancer of the breast or uterus Uncontrolled high blood pressure Migraines with aura There are other conditions as well that may increase your level of risk that comes with taking birth control pills. Also, inform your doctor if you have a first-degree relative (parent, brother, sister, child) who has had blood clots in the legs or lungs. Some drugs, including antibiotics and antiseizure meds, can reduce the effectiveness of birth control pills. Keep another form of birth control, like spermicidal foam and condoms, on hand in case you forget to take a pill. Birth control pills, patches, and vaginal rings are all medications. Always tell your doctor or pharmacist you are on the pill, patch, or vaginal ring if you see him or her for any reason."], [1479, "Birth Control Condoms", "Condoms prevent pregnancies and STDs. They create a barrier that keeps semen and other body fluids out of the vagina, rectum, or the mouth. There are condoms for men and for women -- but don't use both at the same time. It's a fitted, thin plastic cover that a man wears on his penis during sex. Most people use condoms made of latex. If you're sensitive or allergic to that material, you can use ones made of other types of plastic: polyurethane or polyisoprene. Plastic condoms can protect you from STDs, such as HIV, herpes, chlamydia, and gonorrhea, during any kind of sex -- vaginal, oral, and anal. \"Natural\" or \"lambskin\" condoms are made of material that comes from lamb intestines. It can prevent pain and irritation during sex, and it can help keep the condom from breaking. Oil-based lubricants like petroleum jelly can damage the condom and keep it from working. Spermicide is a substance that kills sperm, and some condoms come pre-coated with it. When you use both together, you can lower the risk of pregnancy, but the amount of spermicide that comes with a condom is probably not enough to make a difference. If you want the extra protection, consider getting a separate sperm-killing product. Another common spermicide, nonoxynol-9, can irritate the genitals, which may increase the risk of HIV. Textured condoms, including ribbed and studded ones, are intended to boost the pleasure for you or your partner. If a condom keeps you or your partner from enjoying sex, try textured ones to see if they feel better. You can also make putting on the condom part of foreplay. You might also find glow-in-the-dark or other novelty condoms, too. But be careful: These kinds are typically not FDA-approved and are not proven to prevent pregnancies or STDs. In a year, 2 out of every 100 women whose partners always use condoms correctly will get pregnant. For example, condoms are almost 100% effective at protecting against HIV. But HPV, the most common sexually transmitted disease, can infect areas that a condom does not cover, such as the scrotum. If the man wearing the condom is uncircumcised, pull the foreskin back before you put it on. As you hold onto the tip (if there's not a reservoir), use the other hand to roll the condom all the way down to the base of the penis. If you feel it break or tear during sex, stop immediately, pull out, and put on a new condom. After ejaculation and before the penis loses its erection, carefully pull out, making sure the condom stays on."], [1480, "Birth Control IUDs", "If you're looking into your options for birth control, one method you may want to think about is the IUD. They're not for everyone, but today's IUDs are considered both effective and safe for most women. \"IUD\" stands for \"intrauterine device.\" Shaped like a \"T\" and a bit bigger than a quarter, an IUD fits inside your uterus. Four -- Liletta, Kyleena, Mirena, and Skyla -- release small amounts of the hormone progestin (levonorgestrel) into your body. It's the same hormone used in many birth control pills. These types of IUDs tend to make your period lighter and may be a good option if you have heavy periods. The fifth is ParaGard, also called the copper T IUD. But ParaGard lasts longer than hormonal IUDs. If you use an IUD correctly, your chance of getting pregnant is less than 1%. Once you have one inserted, you don't have to think about it, and neither does your partner. Most healthy women can use an IUD. They're especially suited to women with one partner and at low risk of contracting an STD. IUDs don't protect against STDs. You can't use the copper IUD if you have an allergy to copper or have Wilson's disease, which causes your body hold too much copper. Hormonal IUDs are considered safe unless you have liver disease, breast cancer, or are at a high risk for breast cancer. In rare cases, the size or shape of your uterus may make it tough to place an IUD. Your doctor will insert the IUD during an office visit. Then she'll push the IUD out of the tube and pull the tube out. The procedure is uncomfortable, and you may have cramps and bleeding, but they tend to go away in a few days. Some women may also feel lightheaded from the pain. You can have most IUDs placed at any time in your cycle. If it's put in during your period, hormonal IUDs start working right away. This depends on what kind of IUD you get. 3 years for Liletta and Skyla 5 years for Mirena and Kyleena 10 years for ParaGard With hormonal IUDs, many women have fewer cramps. Eventually, most women have light periods or no period at all. Pregnancies rarely happen with IUDs, but if not having a period will make you constantly worry that you're pregnant, you may want to consider the copper IUD instead. The copper ParaGard may make periods heavier and cramping worse. Your partner shouldn't be able to feel anything, but if he does, it will only be minor contact with the strings of the IUD. The strings soften the longer you have the IUD and can be trimmed shorter. Your cervix should hold the IUD in place, but in rare cases, it can fall all the way or part of the way out. You had the IUD put in right after having a baby or after having a second-trimester abortion. IUDs are more likely to come out during your period. If they feel shorter or longer or if you can feel the IUD itself pushing against your cervix, it may have moved. Using an IUD shouldn't affect your ability to have children later on. If you want to get pregnant, ask your doctor to take out your IUD. You'll put your feet in stirrups and the doctor will use forceps to slowly pull the IUD out. You may have some cramping and bleeding, but this should go away in 1-2 days."], [1481, "Basic Metabolic Panel", "A basic metabolic panel is a blood test that measures your sugar (glucose) level, electrolyte and fluid balance, and kidney function. If you take any medicines, such as diuretics for high blood pressure, your doctor may order a basic metabolic panel to see if the medicines are affecting your kidneys or your electrolytes. Your doctor also may order this panel as part of a regular health examination or to help diagnose a medical condition. This panel measures the blood levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), calcium, carbon dioxide, chloride, creatinine, glucose, potassium, and sodium. Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) Calcium Carbon Dioxide (Bicarbonate) Chloride Creatinine Glucose Potassium Sodium You may be asked to stop eating and drinking for 10 to 12 hours before you have this blood test."], [1482, "Birth Control Best Birth Control Methods", "What's \"best\" among birth control methods differs from person to person. And your needs may change over time, too. You should think about: How fail-proof do you need your protection plan to be? If you're a woman, does it matter if your period is affected? You can compare facts about birth control methods in the sections below, including the basic ways they work. Behavior: Something you or your partner has to do Barrier: Goes on or in your body before you have sex to block the sperm from getting to the egg Hormonal: Changes a woman's body chemistry. (Depending on the specific hormones, it stops ovaries from releasing eggs, thickens the mucus around your cervix to keep sperm from reaching the egg, or thins the lining of the uterus.) Medical: A procedure that changes your body When doctors talk about how effective a birth control method is, sometimes there are different rates when it's used \"ideally\" -- meaning exactly the way it was designed -- versus how the average person uses it in real life. \"Typical\" use takes into account that people can't or don't always use birth control correctly or consistently. Keep in mind, out of every 100 women who don't use any form of birth control, you can expect about 85 to get pregnant within a year. Type: Behavior How it works: Some people consider abstinence to mean zero sexual contact (complete abstinence). Others say it's when the penis does not have contact with the vagina (contraceptive abstinence).

It's natural to feel worried when your doctor tells you that you have it, but keep in mind that it's the least risky type of skin cancer. This cancer is unlikely to spread from your skin to other parts of your body, but it can move nearby into bone or other tissue under your skin. Several treatments can keep that from happening and get rid of the cancer. The tumors start off as small shiny bumps, usually on your nose or other parts of your face. But you can get them on any part of your body, including your trunk, legs, and arms. If you've got fair skin, you're more likely to get this skin cancer. Basal cell carcinoma usually grows very slowly and often doesn't show up for many years after intense or long-term exposure to the sun. Ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun or from a tanning bed are the main cause of basal cell carcinoma. When UV rays hit your skin, over time, they can damage the DNA in your skin cells. The DNA holds the code for the way these cells grow. Over time, damage to the DNA can cause cancer to form. Basal cell carcinoma can look different. At first, a basal cell carcinoma comes up like a small \"pearly\" bump that looks like a flesh-colored mole or a pimple that doesn't go away. Another symptom to watch out for is a waxy, hard skin growth. Basal cell carcinomas are also fragile and can bleed easily. Then he sends it to a lab, where it will be tested for cancer cells. The goal is to get rid of the cancer while leaving as small a scar as possible. To choose the best treatment, your doctor will consider the size and place of the cancer, and how long you've had it. He'll also take into account the chance of scarring, as well as your overall health. These are some of the treatment options your doctor may suggest: Cutting out the tumor. First he'll numb the tumor and the skin around it. Then he'll scrape the tumor with a spoon-shaped device. Next he'll cut out the tumor and a small surrounding area of normal-appearing skin and send it to a lab. If the lab results show there are cancer cells in the area around your tumor, your doctor may need to remove more of your skin. Scraping the tumor away and using electricity to kill cancer cells. Then he uses a curette, a tool that has spoon-like shape to scrape off the tumor. Your doctor controls your bleeding and kills any other cancer cells with an electric needle. Freezing your cancer cells. Your doctor kills your cancer cells by freezing them with liquid nitrogen. This treatment uses X-rays to destroy your cancer cells. He takes out some tissue, then looks at it under a microscope to see if it has cancer cells, before moving on to the next layer. Your doctor may suggest some medicine that can treat your basal cell carcinoma. You're most likely to get this drug if your basal cell carcinoma has spread to other parts of your body. After you've been treated for basal cell carcinoma, you'll need to take some steps to lower your chance of getting cancer again. Some signs of cancer include areas of skin that are growing, changing, or bleeding. Stay out of sunlight between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., when the sun's UVB burning rays are strongest. Make sure you apply sunscreen with at least a sun protection factor of 30 to all parts of the skin that aren't covered up with clothes every day. Basal cell carcinoma rarely spreads to other parts of the body, and the treatment is almost always successful, especially if it's caught early. Sometimes new carcinomas can grow, so it's important to check your skin for any unusual-looking growths and get them checked by your doctor. Learn more about basal cell carcinoma, including pictures of skin tumors, on the web site of the American Cancer Society."], [1484, "Bartonella Bacilliformis Infection", "Summary Bartonellosis is a group of emerging infectious diseases caused by bacteria belonging to the Bartonella genus. Bartonella includes at least 22 named species of bacteria that are mainly transmitted by carriers (vectors), including fleas, lice, or sandflies. Human diseases that have been identified to be caused by one of the Bartonella spp bacteria include cat scratch fever (Bartonella henselae), Carrion's disease (Bartonella bacilliformis), and trench fever (Bartonella quintana). Symptoms of a Bartonella infection include fever, fatigue, malaise, swollen lymph nodes, joint aches and swelling, neurological abnormalities, and skin rash or markings. Bartonella spp have also been associated with diseases of the skin (bacillary angiomatosis), liver (peliosis hepatis), heart (endocarditis), eyes (neuroretinis), blood (bacteremia), and brain (encephalopathy). A number of studies have detected clinically healthy people that have tested positive (seropositive) for Bartonella and those who become ill usually develop mild disease that tends to end without treatment (self-limiting). Diseases caused by Bartonella spp occur all over the United States and in all major regions of the world, with higher prevalence occurring in areas that harbor insect carriers (arthropod vectors)."], [1485, "Bartholin Gland Cyst", "The Bartholin glands are two small organs under the skin in a woman's genital area. The Bartholin glands make a small amount of fluid that moistens the outer genital area, or vulva. If a Bartholin duct gets blocked, fluid builds up in the gland. The blocked gland is called a Bartholin gland cyst . These cysts can range in size from a pea to a large marble. If the Bartholin gland or duct gets infected, it's called a Bartholin gland abscess. Bartholin gland cysts are often small and painless. Things like an infection, thick mucus, or swelling can block a Bartholin gland duct and cause a cyst. The cyst can get bigger after sex, because the glands make more fluid during sex. You may not have any symptoms if the Bartholin gland cyst is small. Symptoms of a cyst that is not infected include: A painless lump in the vulva area. Symptoms of an infected cyst include: Pain that gets worse and makes it hard to walk, sit, or move around. You may find a Bartholin gland cyst on your own, or your doctor may notice it during a physical exam. Unless it is causing symptoms, you may not know you have one. An abscess is diagnosed based on signs of infection, such as fever or swelling, and pain in the vulva area. In some cases, especially if you are older, your doctor may remove the cyst to make sure that it isn't cancer or another problem. To help healing, soak the area in a shallow, warm bath, or a sitz bath. If the cyst is infected, it may break open and start to heal on its own after 3 to 4 days. To keep the cyst from closing and filling up again, your doctor may put a small drainage tube with a small balloon at one end inside the cyst. The balloon is inflated inside the cyst to keep the cyst open. Sometimes a carbon dioxide laser or silver nitrate is used to prevent a cyst from growing back. For severe cysts that keep coming back, you may have surgery to remove the Bartholin gland and duct. There is a procedure called marsupialization in which a pouch is created by making a cut over the cyst and stitching the sides together. This allows the cyst to drain."], [1486, "Barrett Esophagus", "In Barrett's esophagus, normal tissue lining the esophagus -- the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach -- changes to tissue that resembles the lining of the intestine. Barrett's esophagus does not have any specific symptoms, although patients with Barrett's esophagus may have symptoms related to GERD. It does, though, increase the risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma, which is a serious, potentially fatal cancer of the esophagus. Although the risk of this cancer is higher in people with Barrett's esophagus, the disease is still rare. Nevertheless, if you've been diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus, it's important to have routine examinations of your esophagus. With routine examination, your doctor can discover precancerous and cancer cells early, before they spread and when the disease is easier to treat. People with GERD may experience symptoms such as heartburn, a sour, burning sensation in the back of the throat, chronic cough, laryngitis, and nausea. When you swallow food or liquid, it automatically passes through the esophagus, which is a hollow, muscular tube that runs from your throat to your stomach. The lower esophageal sphincter, a ring of muscle at the end of the esophagus where it joins the stomach, keeps stomach contents from rising up into the esophagus. The stomach produces acid in order to digest food, but it is also protected from the acid it produces. But in patients with frequent acid reflux, the normal cells in the esophagus may eventually be replaced by cells that are similar to cells in the intestine to become Barrett's esophagus. Anyone can develop Barrett's esophagus, but white males who have had long-term GERD are more likely than others to develop it. Other risk factors include the onset of GERD at a younger age and a history of current or past smoking. Because there are often no specific symptoms associated with Barrett's esophagus, it can only be diagnosed with an upper endoscopy and biopsy. Once the tube is inserted, the doctor can visually inspect the lining of the esophagus. The doctor will remove a small sample of tissue to be examined under a microscope in the laboratory to confirm a diagnosis. If the biopsy confirms the presence of Barrett's esophagus, your doctor will probably recommend a follow-up endoscopy and biopsy to examine more tissue for early signs of developing cancer. If you have Barrett's esophagus but no cancer or precancerous cells are found, the doctor will still most likely recommend that you have periodic repeat endoscopy. If precancerous cells are present in the biopsy, your doctor will discuss treatment and surveillance options with you. One of the primary goals of treatment is to prevent or slow the development of Barrett's esophagus by treating and controlling acid reflux. Sleeping with your head raised may help prevent the acid in your stomach from flowing up into the esophagus. Those medications may include: Proton pump inhibitors that reduce the production of stomach acid Antacids to neutralize stomach acid H2 blockers that lessen the release of stomach acid Promotility agents -- drugs that speed up the movement of food from the stomach to the intestines There are several treatments, including surgery, that are designed specifically to focus on the abnormal tissue. They include: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) uses radio waves delivered through an endoscope inserted into the esophagus to destroy abnormal cells while protecting the healthy cells underneath. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a laser through an endoscope to kill abnormal cells in the lining without damaging normal tissue. Before the procedure, the patient takes a drug known as Photofrin, which causes cells to become light-sensitive. Endoscopic spray cryotherapy is a newer technique that applies cold nitrogen or carbon dioxide gas, through the endoscope to freeze the abnormal cells. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) lifts the abnormal lining and cuts it off the wall of the esophagus before it's removed through the endoscope. If cancer cells are present, an ultrasound is done first to be sure the cancer hasn't moved deeper into the esophagus walls. Surgery to remove most of the esophagus is an option in cases where severe precancer (dysplasia) or cancer has been diagnosed. The earlier the surgery is done following the diagnosis, the better the chance for the cure. It's important to keep several facts in mind: GERD is common among American adults. Less than 1% of those with Barrett's esophagus each year go on to develop esophageal cancer. Barrett's esophagus, however, can lead to precancerous changes in a small number of people and has an increased risk for cancer."], [1487, "Bardet Biedl Syndrome", "Bardet-Biedl syndrome is a rare, genetic multisystem disorder characterized primarily by deterioration of the cells that receive light stimuli (cone and rod cells), in the retina of the eyes (progressive cone-rod dystrophy), an extra finger near the pinky or an extra toe near the fifth toe (postaxial polydactyly), a condition in which fat is disproportionately distributed on the abdomen and chest rather than the arms and legs (truncal obesity), diminished size and decreased function of the gonads (testes), in males (hypgonadism), kidney (renal), ,abnormalities, and learning difficulties. Visual abnormalities usually become progressively worse and may ultimately result in blindness. Most cases of Bardet-Biedl syndrome are inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Bardet-Biedl syndrome shows significant overlap with a disorder called Laurence-Moon syndrome. In fact, in the past, these disorders were considered the same and referred to as Laurence-Bardet-Biedl syndrome. However, recent research has demonstrated that some individuals with the clinical findings of Laurence-Moon syndrome have had mutations in genes linked to Bardet-Biedl syndrome."], [1488, "Banti's Disease", "Banti syndrome is a disorder of the spleen, the large, gland-like organ in the upper left side of the abdomen that produces red blood cells before birth and, in newborns, removes and destroys aged red blood cells, and plays a role in fighting infection.

Hair is made up of a protein called keratin that is produced in hair follicles in the outer layer of skin. As follicles produce new hair cells, old cells are being pushed out through the surface of the skin at the rate of about six inches a year. The average adult head has about 100,000 to 150,000 hairs and loses up to 100 of them a day; finding a few stray hairs on your hairbrush is not necessarily cause for alarm. At any one time, about 90% of the hair on a person's scalp is growing. This life cycle is divided into three phases: Anagen -- active hair growth that lasts between two to six years Catagen -- transitional hair growth that lasts two to three weeks Telogen -- resting phase that lasts about two to three months; at the end of the resting phase the hair is shed and a new hair replaces it and the growing cycle starts again. There are many types of hair loss, also called alopecia: Involutional alopecia is a natural condition in which the hair gradually thins with age. More hair follicles go into the resting phase, and the remaining hairs become shorter and fewer in number. It's characterized by a receding hairline and gradual disappearance of hair from the crown and frontal scalp. Women experience a general thinning over the entire scalp, with the most extensive hair loss at the crown. Alopecia areata often starts suddenly and causes patchy hair loss in children and young adults. But in about 90% of people with the condition, the hair returns within a few years. Alopecia universalis causes all body hair to fall out, including the eyebrows, eyelashes, and pubic hair. Telogen effluvium is temporary hair thinning over the scalp that occurs because of changes in the growth cycle of hair. A large number of hairs enter the resting phase at the same time, causing hair shedding and subsequent thinning. Inflammatory skin conditions (cellulitis, folliculitis, acne), and other skin disorders (such as some forms of lupus and lichen planus) often result in scars that destroy the ability of the hair to regenerate. Doctors don't know why certain hair follicles are programmed to have a shorter growth period than others. However, several factors may influence hair loss: Hormones, such as abnormal levels of androgens (male hormones normally produced by both men and women) Genes, from both male and female parents, may influence a person's predisposition to male or female pattern baldness. In such cases, normal hair growth usually returns once the injury heals unless a scar is produced. In alopecia areata, the immune system revs up for unknown reasons and affects the hair follicles. In most people with alopecia areata, the hair grows back, although it may temporarily be very fine and possibly a lighter color before normal coloration and thickness return. In most instances hair grows back normally if the source of the problem is removed. Still, severe damage to the hair or scalp sometimes causes permanent bald patches. Most times, when the underlying condition is treated, the hair will return unless there is scarring as in some forms of lupus, lichen planus or follicular disorders."], [1490, "Balantidiasis", "Balantidiasis is a rare intestinal infection caused by the bacterium, Balantidium coli, a single celled parasite (ciliate protozoan) that frequently infects pigs but on occasion (rarely) infects humans.

Bad breath can also be made worse by the types of foods you eat and other unhealthy lifestyle habits. Basically, all the food eaten begins to be broken down in your mouth. In addition, odor-causing bacteria and food particles can cause bad breath if dentures are not properly cleaned. Smoking or chewing tobacco-based products also can cause bad breath, stain teeth, reduce your ability to taste foods, and irritate your gums. Persistent bad breath or a bad taste in the mouth may be a warning sign of gum (periodontal) disease. Bacteria cause the formation of toxins to form, which irritate the gums. If gum disease continues untreated, it can damage the gums and jawbone. Other dental causes of bad breath include poorly fitting dental appliances, yeast infections of the mouth, and dental caries (cavities). The medical condition dry mouth (also called xerostomia) also can cause bad breath. Saliva is necessary to moisten the mouth, neutralize acids produced by plaque, and wash away dead cells that accumulate on the tongue, gums, and cheeks. If not removed, these cells decompose and can cause bad breath. Dry mouth may be a side effect of various medications, salivary gland problems, or continuous breathing through the mouth. Many other diseases and illnesses may cause bad breath. Here are some to be aware of: respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia or bronchitis, chronic sinus infections, postnasal drip, diabetes, chronic acid reflux, and liver or kidney problems. Bad breath can be reduced or prevented if you: Practice good oral hygiene. Use floss or an interdental cleaner to remove food particles and plaque between teeth once a day. Dentures should be removed at night and cleaned thoroughly before being placed in your mouth the next morning. He or she will conduct an oral exam and professional teeth cleaning and will be able to detect and treat periodontal disease, dry mouth, or other problems that may be the cause of bad mouth odor. If you think they may be causing bad breath, bring the log to your dentist to review. In most cases, your dentist can treat the cause of bad breath. If your dentist determines that your mouth is healthy and the odor is not of oral origin, you may be referred to your family doctor or to a specialist to determine the odor source and treatment plan. If the odor is due to gum disease, for example, your dentist can either treat the disease or refer you to a periodontist, a dentist who specializes in treating gum conditions."], [1492, "Bacterial Vaginosis", "Bacterial vaginosis is a mild infection of the vagina caused by bacteria. Normally, there are a lot of \"good\" bacteria and some \"bad\" bacteria in the vagina. In women with bacterial vaginosis, the balance is upset. Bacterial vaginosis is usually a mild problem that may go away on its own in a few days. But certain things make it more likely to happen. Your risk of getting bacterial vaginosis is higher if you: Have more than one sex partner or have a new sex partner. You may be able to avoid bacterial vaginosis if you limit your number of sex partners and don't douche or smoke. Bacterial vaginosis is more common in women who are sexually active. But it can occur if you are not sexually active as well. It may look grayish white or yellow. A sign of bacterial vaginosis can be a \"fishy\" smell, which may be worse after sex. About half of women who have bacterial vaginosis do not notice any symptoms. Doctors diagnose bacterial vaginosis by asking about the symptoms, doing a pelvic exam, and taking a sample of the vaginal discharge. The sample can be tested to find out if you have bacterial vaginosis. Bacterial vaginosis usually does not cause other health problems. If you have it when you have a pelvic procedure such as a cesarean section, an abortion, or a hysterectomy, you are more likely to get a pelvic infection. Doctors usually prescribe an antibiotic to treat bacterial vaginosis. They come as pills you swallow or as a cream or capsules (called ovules) that you put in your vagina. If you are pregnant, you will need to take pills. Bacterial vaginosis usually clears up in 2 or 3 days with antibiotics, but treatment goes on for 7 days. Antibiotics usually work well and have few side effects. But taking them can lead to a vaginal yeast infection. How is bacterial vaginosis diagnosed? How is bacterial vaginosis treated?"], [1493, "Bacterial Meningococcal Meningitis", "Meningococcal meningitis is a rare but serious bacterial infection. It causes the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord to become inflamed. Each year, approximately 1,000 people in the U.S. get meningococcal disease, which includes meningitis and septicemia (blood infection). Meningococcal meningitis can be fatal or cause great harm without prompt treatment; as many as one out of five people who contract the infection have serious complications. According to the Centers for Disease Control, about 15% of those who survive are left with disabilities that include deafness, brain damage, and neurological problems. Here's what you need to know about the symptoms of meningococcal meningitis and ways to prevent and treat it. Bacteria and viruses are the two main causes of meningitis. The bacterium Neisseria meningitidis, also called meningococcus, causes meningococcal meningitis. In children and teens, meningococcus is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis. Meningococcal bacteria may cause infection in a part of the body -- the skin, gastrointestinal tract, or respiratory tract, for instance. Symptoms of meningococcal meningitis may vary from case to case. The more common signs and symptoms include: General poor feeling Sudden high fever Severe, persistent headache Neck stiffness Nausea or vomiting Discomfort in bright lights Drowsiness or difficulty awakening Joint pain Confusion or other mental changes A reddish or purple skin rashis a very important sign to watch for. If it does not turn white when you press a glass against it, the rash may be a sign of blood poisoning. Other symptoms of meningitis or blood poisoning may include: Tense or bulging soft spot (in babies) High-pitched or moaning cry (in babies) Stiff, jerky movements or floppiness (in babies or toddlers) Irritability Fast breathing Lethargy or excessive sleepiness Blotchy skin, turning pale or blue Shivering, or cold hands and feet Seizure Meningococcal meningitis can cause death or serious complications, such as brain damage, paralysis, gangrene, or deafness. Go to an emergency room or call 911 if: You notice symptoms of meningococcal meningitis Symptoms do not improve with treatment You think you have been exposed to meningococcal meningitis Tests can confirm a diagnosis of meningococcal meningitis. The doctor may start antibiotics, such as penicillin or ceftriaxone, by an IV, or intravenous line. If you or someone you love has come into close contact (via saliva or other oral secretions) with someone who has meningococcal meningitis -- such as at school, day care, work, or home -- it is very important to get antibiotics to prevent infection. Meningococcal meningitis is a serious disease -- even with treatment. In the U.S., three types of meningococcal vaccines are used: Meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) -- One of these vaccines, Menactra, is approved for people ages 9 months to 55. The other, Menveo, is used in those ages 2 through 55. Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) -- This vaccine was approved in the 1970s and protects against most forms of meningococcal disease. Trumenba (MenB-FHbp) and Bexsero (MenB-4C). Although they cannot prevent all types of meningococcal disease, both vaccines can prevent many types of the disease. Doctors recommend a dose of MCV4, which is given as a shot, for children at age 11, and then a booster shot at age 16. That includes: People who think they've been exposed to meningococcal meningitis College freshmen living in dorms U.S. military recruits Travelers to areas of the world, such as Africa, where meningococcal disease is common People with a damaged spleen or with terminal complement component deficiency, which is an immune system disorder Lab personnel who are often exposed to the meningococcal bacteria A second dose may be needed for people at high risk. This includes a high fever, weakness, or signs of an allergic reaction, such as trouble breathing, a fast heartbeat, or dizziness."], [1494, "Baby Safety", "The following tips should help you keep your baby out of harm's way from birth through his toddler years. Always use a federally approved car safety seat when traveling in a motor vehicle. For the first two years of a baby's life, car seats should face the rear of the vehicle. The safest location for the car seat is the middle of the back seat. NEVER put the baby in the front passenger seat of cars, especially those with airbags. If you have a truck with no back seat, you should disengage the airbag while the baby's seat is in the car. If you have questions about safety seats, call the Auto Safety Hotline at 1-888-327-4236 (1-888-DASH-2-DOT). To minimize the risk that a child will accidentally be left behind in a car or get trapped inside: Leave a purse, briefcase, or cell phone in the back seat. That way, you get in the habit of checking in the back seat before leaving the vehicle. Make an arrangement with your child's daycare to have them call you if the child doesn't show up as expected. Always lock your car and car trunk, even if the car is parked in the driveway at home, and always keep keys out of the reach of little ones. If you use an infant carrier, always place it on the floor, never on a counter or tabletop. Make sure if the baby is always strapped in. Even if looking away for a second, an accident can happen. Even smoking \"outside\" is harmful for the baby because clothing, hair and skin still carries smoke particles which affects the baby. Instead, warm the formula by running warm tap water over the bottle or submerging the bottle in a bowl of warm water. Keep sharp objects (knives, scissors, tools, razors) and other hazardous items (coins, glass objects, beads, pins, medications) in a secure place out of baby's reach. NEVER shake a baby or throw your baby in the air. Do not leave your baby alone with a young sibling or a pet, even when your baby is sleeping. Make sure all drawers have stops, so that your baby or toddler can't pull the drawer out on top of himself. Attach furniture to the wall so the pieces don't fall over the child. Always test the bath water to make sure it is not too hot before setting your baby in the water. Dipping your elbow in the water is a good way to test. Turn down your hot water heater to 120deg F. Never leave your baby unattended in the bathtub or bath ring. Store small appliances, such as hair dryers and radios, away from the water and bathing areas. Be sure that toys are unbreakable, do not come apart, do not have small parts that could be chewed or broken off, and are not sharp. Use toy chests without lids or with supports that hold a lid open in any position. NEVER put strings or cords around your baby's neck (such as to hold a pacifier) or near baby's crib. Be cautious of strings or buttons on clothing; make sure they are not in danger of choking your baby. Secure cords on blinds and drapes out of reach to prevent accidental strangulation. Put away small objects -- even display items -- that can cause injury or choking if swallowed. Avoid giving your child raw carrots, unpeeled apples, nuts, hard candies, and other foods that present a choking hazard. In a highchair, always use restraining straps that run around your child's waist and between his legs to keep him from sliding out. Avoid soft bedding that might suffocate your baby, such as pillows, blankets, plush toys, and bumpers in the crib. Crib slats should be 2 3/8 inches apart or less so head can't get trapped. Keep baby's room at a moderate temperature and dress them in a way that they can't overheat. Avoid devices marketed to reduce the risk of SIDS, such as sleep positioners. Nursing your baby and making sure that your baby gets all of the recommended vaccines can help protect against SIDS. Don't nurse in a chair or on a couch if you feel you might fall asleep. If you baby falls asleep in a car seat, swing or carrier, try to remove her and lay her on a flat surface. Always keep your hands and eyes on baby while he or she is on the changing table. Install safety gates securely in front of stairs and basement doors. Instead, use gates with straight, vertical slats and a swinging door. Store cleaners and medications out of reach and in a locked cabinet. If there is a swimming pool in your backyard or your neighborhood, make sure it is surrounded by a fence and has a gate that latches or locks. Keep your child away from moving machinery, including lawn mowers, overhead garage doors. Cover them up with clothes and a hat, limit their time in the sun (especially between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., when the sun is strongest), don't let them get overheated, and get them out of the sun right away if they show any signs of sunburn or dehydration, including fussiness, redness, and excessive crying. Turn pot and pan handles on the stove in and cook on the back burners whenever possible. Establish the area in front of the stove as off limits while you are cooking. Keep the toilet lid down to prevent drowning and to keep the lid from slamming on your baby's head or hands. If possible, move sharp-edged pieces of furniture away from high traffic areas. You can find out about these classes from your local Red Cross or American Heart Association chapter. Gather a list of emergency numbers and keep them by the phone. These numbers should include: your child's pediatrician, your health care provider, your family doctor, a 24-hour nurse-on-call number, the police department, the fire department, 911 reminder, and poison control. If a poison is swallowed, call the poison control center (throughout the USA, call 1-800-222-1222-- American Association of Poison Control Centers.) In the unfortunate event that something happens to you or your spouse, it's a good idea to have a will that names a legal guardian and alternate guardian for your child. Without a will, the court may appoint a guardian you would not have chosen. Be sure to check with the individuals named in your will to make sure they are willing to serve as your child's guardian. In your will, you can also leave assets to your child in the form of a testamentary, or \"after death\" trust."], [1495, "Baby Hygiene", "Unfortunately for new parents, babies don't come with instruction manuals. So when it comes to even the simplest tasks, like baths and nail trimming, some parents feel confused. If you're unsure about the baby grooming basics, here's a handy guide to help make hygiene as easy as loving your baby. Until your baby's umbilical cord falls off, which usually happens after the first week, don't give any baths. Instead, give your baby a sponge wash, or 'top and tail'. If it is cold, you can take off one item of clothing at a time while you wash your baby. Gently wash your baby's face with a lukewarm, wet washcloth. Add soap to the wet cloth to wash your baby's body. Put a small amount of baby shampoo on your baby's hair. Gently rub in a circular motion, and then use a plastic cup or your hand to rinse off the shampoo. Your baby doesn't need a bath every day -- two to three times a week should be fine. Whether you bathe baby in a baby bath, the sink, or the bathtub is up to you. But considering that babies are slippery when wet, some parents feel better able to handle giving a bath in the smaller space of a baby bath or the sink. The most important thing to remember about baths is to never leave your baby unattended. Babies can slide down and quickly become submerged in even a few inches of water. Using a baby bath seat is no assurance that your baby will be safe in the bathtub. If you need to leave the room, wrap your baby in a towel and take her with you. Here are tips for giving your baby a tub bath: Put the washcloth, soap, and shampoo -- everything you'll need for the bath -- close by. That way, you don't have to leave the room once your baby is in the tub. Also, lay out a diaper and clothes where you can easily reach them after the bath. Fill the tub with 2 to 3 inches of water. Use a wet cotton ball or washcloth (no soap) to clean your baby's eyes and face. Soap the washcloth (use a gentle, no-tears baby soap or wash) and clean your baby's body from top to bottom and front to back. Fill a cup with water to wet baby's hair. When lifting your baby out of the bath, support her bottom with one hand and the head and neck with the other. You don't need to use lotion, but you can apply it after the bath if your baby's skin is especially dry. It's common for babies to develop flaky, red patches of skin on their scalp called cradle cap. Here's how: Before a bath, massage a little bit of petroleum jelly, olive oil, or baby oil into your baby's scalp to loosen the dry skin. Gently rub the oil into your baby's scalp with a soft brush or washcloth to release the flakes. If it sticks around or spreads to baby's face, neck, or other parts of the body, see your doctor. Because your baby's fingernails grow very quickly and babies can easily scratch themselves, file or cut the nails about twice a week. Whether you opt for baby scissors, a baby nail clipper, or a nail file is up to you. Considering the tiny size of baby's nails, decide which one you're most comfortable using. Filing generally runs less of a risk that you'll cut your baby's skin. Here are some tips to make cutting nails easier: Cut nails after a bath, when they're softer. Sometimes it helps to trim a baby's nails when the baby is asleep and relaxed. If you use scissors or a nail clipper, press the skin under the nail down so you can get to the nail more easily. If you accidentally nip baby's skin with the scissors, apply gentle pressure with a tissue or piece of gauze."], [1496, "B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for Adults", "B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a cancer that affects your \"B lymphocytes\" -- white blood cells that grow in the soft center of your bones, called marrow. But in this disease, they turn into \"leukemia\" cells that live longer than normal cells and reproduce quickly. Remember, you have control over the decisions you make about your treatment and your life. Ask your doctor about support groups, where you can meet people who understand what you're going through. Some things may increase your chances of getting it: for instance, if you've had chemotherapy or radiation treatment for cancer in the past. Also, getting chemotherapy and radiation together raises your risk even more. Treatments that kill your leukemia cells also get rid of the symptoms. When you first get B-cell ALL, you may feel tired and get a fever. If the leukemia cells in your bone marrow crowd out cells that are in charge of making blood, you won't have enough normal blood cells. When this happens, you may start feeling weak, dizzy, or light-headed. You may also get symptoms such as: Shortness of breath Repeated infections Bruise easily Frequent bleeding, such as nosebleeds or from your gums Some symptoms depend on where in your body the leukemia cells move. For instance, if they travel to your liver and spleen, they may cause these organs to get bigger. You may feel pain in your joints or bones if the leukemia cells have spread there. If the cancer cells have moved into the lymph nodes of your neck, underarms, or groin, you may see swelling in those areas. It's not as common, but sometimes the leukemia cells move to the brain and cause headaches or trouble with balance. Leukemia cells that get into your chest may lead to breathing problems. Your doctor may also want you to take some blood tests that can give clues about whether you have B-cell ALL: Complete blood count (CBC). It checks the number of blood cells in your body, including white blood cells. The results of these tests can reveal signs that you may have B-cell ALL, such as too many young white blood cells or too few of the two other types of blood cells -- red blood cells and platelets. You may also need to get a bone marrow test. Your doctor will take samples of your bone marrow, usually from the back of your hip bone. For this test, you lie down on a table and get a shot that will numb the area. Once B-cell ALL has been diagnosed, your doctor may want to do tests to see if it has spread to other parts of your body. An X-ray uses radiation in low doses to make images of your body's structures. A CT scan is a series of X-rays from different angles that makes detailed images of what is inside your body. You may also get a test called a spinal tap (lumbar puncture). Then he puts a needle in the area around your spinal cord to remove some fluid called CSF (cerebrospinal fluid). There's a lot to take in when your doctor gives you a diagnosis of B-cell ALL. Some questions you can ask your doctor include: What kind of treatment do you recommend? The word \"acute\" in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia means the disease spreads quickly, so it's important to get early treatment. The goal of the first phase is \"total remission\" -- to kill the leukemia cells and get rid of all your symptoms. Your doctor may call it the induction phase. If you go into remission, the next stage is to kill any leftover leukemia cells that aren't active but could grow later, causing the disease to return. Your doctor may call this phase of treatment the consolidation phase or \"post-remission therapy.\" In this treatment, you take drugs that move through your bloodstream and kill cancer cells throughout your body. While you're getting chemo, you may feel nauseous, but certain medicines can reduce vomiting. After your high-dose chemo, you'll get a transplant of stem cells that can help get your bone marrow working right again. The stem cells in a transplant live in your bone marrow and help make new blood cells. You'll need to get on a waiting list to find a donor who is the right match for you, so your body doesn't \"reject\" the new cells. Close relatives, such as a brother or sister, are the best chance for a good match. If that doesn't work out, you need to get on a list of potential donors from strangers. Sometimes the best chance for the right stem cells for you will be from someone who is the same race or ethnicity as you. Before the transplant, you'll likely need to get treated with high doses of chemo for about a week or two. This can be a tough process, because you may get side effects like nausea and mouth sores. During this time you may be in the hospital, or at the very least, will need to make visits every day to get checked by your transplant team. It can take 6 months to a year until the number of normal blood cells in your body gets back to what it should be. You often get the drugs in this type of therapy every day in pill form. This treatment doesn't work for everyone, but it puts a lot of people into remission and may help keep the cancer from coming back. CAR T-cell therapy uses some of your own immune cells, known as T cells, to treat your cancer. Doctors take the cells out of your blood and change them by adding new genes. While you're getting treatment, you can do a lot of things to manage side effects and stay healthy. Since chemotherapy can sometimes upset your stomach, you can try changing some of your eating habits. You can also try eating five or six small meals a day rather than the traditional three meals. If your treatment makes you tired, try to take short naps. You also might find that short walks can help boost your energy. If you're stressed about your treatment, sometimes deep breathing or meditation can help you relax. For others, the cancer may not go away completely, or it may return. If that's the case, you may need regular treatment with chemotherapy or other drugs to keep it in check for as long as possible. If that happens, you may want to focus on making sure you're as comfortable as possible, known as palliative care. You may not be able to control your cancer, but you can control choices about how you'll live your life. Consider joining a support group, where you can you share your feelings with others who understand what it's like. You can get more information about B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and learn how to join support groups, on the web site of the American Cancer Society."], [1497, "Dyslexia", "Dyslexia is a learning disorder that affects your ability to read, spell, write, and speak. Kids who have it are often smart and hardworking, but they have trouble connecting the letters they see to the sounds those letters make. Others don't realize they have dyslexia until they get older. Kids with dyslexia often have normal vision and are just as smart as their peers. Trouble processing words can also make it hard to spell, write, and speak clearly. It's linked to genes, which is why the condition often runs in families. You're more likely to have dyslexia if your parents, siblings, or other family members have it. When children learn to read, they first figure out what sound each letter makes. Then, they learn how to put those sounds in order to form words (\"C-A-T\" spells \"cat\"). For kids who have dyslexia, the brain has a hard time connecting letters to the sounds they make, and then blending those sounds into words. So to someone with dyslexia, the word \"cat\" might read as \"tac.\" Because of these mix-ups, reading can be a slow and difficult process. Even if children aren't able to fully outgrow dyslexia, they can still go to college and succeed in life."], [1498, "Dwarfism, Metatropic", "Other characteristics of this disorder are a narrow thorax, short ribs, and kyphoscoliosis (backward and sideways curvature of the spinal column) which develops into short trunk dwarfism."], [1499, "Dwarfism, Deformity with Mesomelic", "Dyschondrosteosis is a very rare inherited disorder characterized by unusually shortened, bowed bones in the forearms (radius and ulna), abnormal deviation of the wrist toward the thumb side of the hand due to shortening of the radius and dislocation of the end portion of the ulna (Madelung deformity), unusually short lower legs, and associated short stature (mesomelic dwarfism).

Children with DMD have a hard time standing up, walking, and climbing stairs. Although there isn't a cure, the outlook for people with DMD is better than it has ever been. Years ago, children with the disease usually didn't live beyond their teens. DMD is caused by a problem in one of your genes. If you have DMD, the gene that makes a protein called dystrophin is broken. The condition is more common in boys because of the way parents pass DMD genes to their children. It's what scientists call a sex-linked disease because it's connected to the groups of genes, called chromosomes, that determine if a baby is a boy or a girl. It's rare, but sometimes people who don't have a family history of DMD get the disease when their genes get defects on their own. If your child has DMD, you'll probably notice the first signs before he turns 6 years old. Muscles in the legs are usually some of the first affected, so he'll probably start to walk much later than other children his age. Once he can walk, he may fall down often and have trouble climbing stairs or getting up from the floor. DMD also can damage the heart, lungs, and other parts of the body. As he gets older, your child might have other symptoms, including: A curved spine, also called scoliosis Shortened, tight muscles in his legs, called contractures Headaches Problems with learning and memory Shortness of breath Sleepiness Trouble concentrating The muscle problems can cause cramps at times, but in general, DMD isn't painful. Although some children with the disorder have learning and behavior problems, DMD doesn't affect your child's intelligence. You should let your child's doctor know about the symptoms you've been noticing. He'll want to know your child's medical history, then ask questions about his symptoms, like: How old was your child when he started walking? The doctor will give your child a physical exam, and he may do some tests to rule out other conditions that can cause muscle weakness. If the doctor suspects DMD, he'll do some other tests, including: Blood tests. The doctor will take a sample of your child's blood and test it for creatine kinase, an enzyme that your muscles release when they are damaged. A high CK level is a sign that your child could have DMD. Doctors can also test the blood sample to look for a change in the dystrophin gene that causes DMD. Girls in the family can get the test to see if they carry this gene. Using a needle, the doctor removes a tiny piece of your child's muscle. He'll look at it under a microscope to check for low levels of dystrophin, the protein that is missing in people with DMD. If your child has DMD, you'll want to get as much information about his condition as you can. There's no cure for DMD, but there are medicines and other therapies that can ease your child's symptoms, protect his muscles, and keep his heart and lungs healthy. It is an injection medication that helps treat individuals with a specific mutation of the gene that leads to DMD. The oral corticosteroid deflazacort (Emflaza) was approved in 2017 to treat DMD, becoming the first FDA approval of any corticosteroid to treat the condition. The drugs also can help your child's heart and lungs work better. Because DMD can cause heart problems, it's important for your child to see a heart doctor, called a cardiologist, for checkups once every 2 years until age 10, and once a year after that. Girls and women who carry the gene have a higher risk of heart problems, too. Kids with DMD might need surgery to fix shortened muscles, straighten the spine, or treat a heart or lung problem. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for your child. Remember that the disease doesn't mean he can't go to school, play sports, and have fun with friends. If you stick with his treatment plan and know what works for your child, you can help him live an active life. Being upright will keep your child's bones strong and his spine straight. There's no special diet for children with DMD, but healthy foods can prevent weight problems or help with constipation. Work with a dietitian to make sure your child eats the right balance of nutrients and calories each day. Exercise and stretches can keep your child's muscles and joints limber and help him feel better. Other families living with DMD can be great resources for advice and understanding about life with the disease. As your child gets older, his muscles will become weaker and he most likely won't be able to walk. Many boys with DMD will need a wheelchair by the time they are 12 years old to help them get around. Today, young adults with DMD can go to college, have careers, marry, and start families. Scientists are also testing new ways to treat the genes that cause DMD. These treatments might soon improve the outlook for even more for people with DMD. In 2014, officials in Europe approved ataluren (Translarna), the first drug to treat the genetic cause of DMD.

At about 2 months, your baby probably should be taking around 4 ounces at each feeding, and both breast and bottle feedings should be at least every 3 to 4 hours during the day with longer stretches at night. Infants should be placed on their back to sleep to reduce the risk of SIDS. Most babies aren't able to roll over by themselves until around 4 months of age. How much should my baby be peeing and pooping now?At around two months, your baby should have at least four to six wet diapers a day. If you are breastfeeding, your baby's stools should be soft and slightly runny. If you are formula-feeding, your baby's stools will probably be a little firmer, but should not be hard or formed. The frequency of poopy diapers may range from a few each day day to once every few days. The color can also vary but should never be red, white, or black. When will my baby start sleeping through the night without a feeding?At about three months, most babies will sleep around 15 hours in a 24-hour period. Most babies will take 2 to 3 naps during the day, followed by a longer stretch during the night after a late-night feeding. The definition of \"sleeping through the night\" at this stage is only about 5 hours and ranges from baby to baby. Should I be giving my baby vitamins if I'm breastfeeding?Breastfed infants should be getting vitamin D supplements starting soon after birth, but additional supplements, water, juice, and solid foods usually aren't necessary. Grasping objects Swatting at objects dangling in front of him Shaking toys To avoid spit-ups, keep your baby calm during feedings and give him just a little milk or formula at a time. Keep stuffed animals, pillows, comforters, and any other soft objects out of your baby's crib. It's best, for your baby's sake, to avoid alcohol at least 2 hours (per drink) before breastfeeding or expressing breastmilk. That gives your body time to rid itself of the alcohol before the next feeding. If you are going to drink, consider that exposing your infant to alcohol via breastmilk may be dangerous."], [1512, "Drug Allergies", "Your body responds with certain chemicals, such as large amounts of histamine, to try to get rid of it. But during an allergic reaction, the release of histamine can cause symptoms like hives, a skin rash, itchy skin or eyes, congestion, and swelling in the mouth and throat. A more severe reaction, called anaphylaxis, may include trouble breathing, blueness of the skin, dizziness, fainting, anxiety, confusion, rapid pulse, nausea, diarrhea, and other serious symptoms. Other meds commonly found to cause allergic reactions include sulfa drugs, barbiturates, anti-seizure drugs, and insulin. If he thinks you might be allergic to an antibiotic, such as penicillin, he may give you a skin test to confirm it. But skin testing doesn't work for all drugs, and in some cases it could be dangerous. If you've had a severe, life-threatening reaction to a particular drug, your doctor will simply rule out that medicine as a treatment option for you. Getting an allergy test to find out if the severe reaction was a \"true\" allergic response isn't needed if there are other drug options. For instance, medicines such as antihistamines, and in some cases, corticosteroids, can often control rash, hives, and itching. For coughing and lung congestion, your doctor may prescribe drugs called bronchodilators (such as albuterol or combivent) to widen your airways. For anaphylaxis symptoms, you may need a shot of epinephrine, and you definitely need emergency medical care, even if those symptoms stop after you take epinephrine. Sometimes, doctors use a process called desensitization to treat an allergy to penicillin or other drugs. Over time, you'll get shots of tiny amounts of penicillin, with increasingly larger amounts until your immune system can handle the drug.

There are two types: Irritant contact dermatitis is caused by chemicals like harsh cleaners. Allergic contact dermatitis is just like it sounds -- your body reacts to an allergy trigger. People who have allergies react to things that wouldn't bother most others.Anything from plants like poison ivy to dyes and fragrances found in everyday products might be allergens. You could also have an allergic reaction to something in the air that settles on your skin, like pollen, chemical sprays, powders, fibers, or cigarette smoke. This is called airborne contact dermatitis, and it mostly happens on your eyelids, head, and neck. Skin allergies can also cause hives and swelling deep in your skin, called angioedema. If you can't avoid contact with an allergy trigger, you can usually treat the rash and ease the itching. But once you develop an allergy, you could have a reaction within a few minutes of coming into contact with it. The most common causes of skin allergies include: Nickel, a metal used in jewelry and snaps on jeans, makeup, lotions, soaps, and shampoos Sunscreens and bug sprays Medications you put on your skin, like antibiotics or anti-itch creams Fragrances Cleaning products Plants, including poison ivy Latex, which is used in stretchy things like plastic gloves, elastic in clothing, condoms, and balloons Chemicals You're more likely to have certain skin allergies if you a have skin condition like eczema (your doctor may call it atopic dermatitis), inflammation in your lower legs because of poor circulation, itching in your private parts, or you often get swimmer's ear.

It's a pre-packaged set of three panels that your doctor will stick to your back. To figure that out, your doctor may do more patch testing. If you have a mild reaction in any patch test, you might need to follow up with a ROAT test. It works a lot like the TRUE test, but you do it yourself. Put the suspected allergen, say, sunscreen, on your skin during the day in the same spot over several days. The dimethylglyoxime test looks for metal objects that have enough nickel to cause a reaction. Your doctor can test things in the office, or you can buy a kit to test jewelry and other items yourself. You may need to wear gloves to protect your skin.

If a baby slips or rolls and lands facedown, he or she may not be able to turn over. Bathing seats or flotation devices may be used, but they don't protect against drowning and aren't a substitute for your attention. Buckets have tall, straight sides, which make it very hard for infants and young children to escape if they have fallen in. Keep young children out of the bathroom without your direct supervision. Make sure your toddler knows that the toilet isn't a toy. Toilets are drowning hazards, especially for children younger than 3. They can accumulate water and become a drowning hazard. Empty coolers immediately after use, and keep lids closed. Watch children closely outdoors, especially where wells, open postholes, and irrigation or drainage ditches are nearby. Fill holes and install fences or other barriers to protect your child. Make sure pools are fenced off and have covers that lock.

Don't let your child use inflatable swimming aids (such as \"water wings\") without constant supervision. For example, a child who frequently uses water wings may learn to jump into a pool on impulse. Also, learn swimming survival and rescue techniques. If you enroll your child in swim lessons, remember that swim lessons won't necessarily prevent drowning. Swim lessons may give you and your child a false sense of security and make you both less cautious around water. Be sure that your child swims only when a watchful adult is present.3 When visiting public or private pools, make sure that your children are supervised closely and that they are familiar with pool safety rules."], [1515, "Down Syndrome", "Your genes hold the keys to how your body looks and works. Chromosomes are bundles of genes, and your body relies on having just the right number of them. With Down syndrome, this extra chromosome leads to a range of issues that affect you both mentally and physically. If your child has it, getting the right care early on can make a big difference in helping him live a full and meaningful life. Some will grow up to live almost entirely on their own, while others will need more help taking care of themselves. People with Down syndrome tend to have certain physical features in common. For example, they often have flat noses and small ears. Their mental abilities will vary, but most have mild to moderate issues with thinking, reasoning, and understanding. They'll learn and pick up new skills their whole lives, but may take longer to reach important goals like walking, talking, and developing social skills. Many people with Down syndrome don't have any other health issues, but some do. Common conditions include heart problems and trouble hearing and seeing. But with Down syndrome, something goes wrong and you get an extra copy of chromosome 21. That means you have three copies instead of two, which leads to the signs and symptoms of Down syndrome. While doctors don't know what causes it, they do know that women 35 and older have a higher chance of having a baby with Down syndrome. If you've already had a child with Down syndrome, you're more likely to have another one who has it as well. It's not common, but it is possible to pass Down syndrome from parent to child. That means some of their genes aren't in their normal place, perhaps on a different chromosome from where they'd usually be found. The parent doesn't have Down syndrome because they have the right number of genes, but their child may have what's called \"translocation Down syndrome.\" Not everyone with translocation Down syndrome gets it from their parents -- it may also happen by chance.

He or she may act jealous, controlling, or possessive. These early signs of abuse may happen soon after the start of the relationship and might be hard to notice at first. The abuser may begin making threats, calling the other person names, and slamming doors or breaking dishes. This is a form of emotional abuse that is sometimes used to make the person feel bad or weak. Physical abuse that starts with a slap might lead to kicking, shoving, and choking over time. As a way to control the person, the abuser may make violent threats against the person's children, other family members, or pets. Abusers may also control or withhold money to make the person feel weak and dependent. Domestic violence also includes sexual abuse, such as forcing a person to have sex against her will.

It takes your brain, several nerves and muscles, two muscular valves, and an open, unconstricted esophagus, or swallowing tube to work just right. The act of swallowing normally happens in three phases. In the first phase, food or liquid is contained in the mouth by the tongue and palate (oral cavity). The second phase begins when the brain makes the decision to swallow. At the same time, two other things happen: A muscular valve at the bottom of the pharynx opens, allowing food to enter the esophagus, and other muscles close the airway (trachea) to prevent food from entering the airways. The esophagus, which is about nine inches long, is a muscular tube that produces waves of coordinated contractions (peristalsis). As the esophagus contracts, a muscular valve at the end of the esophagus opens and food is propelled into the stomach. A wide range of diseases can cause swallowing problems, which your doctor may call \"dysphagia.\" These include: Disturbances of the brain such as those caused by Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, or ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease) Oral or pharynx muscle dysfunction such as from a stroke Loss of sphincter muscle relaxation (termed \"achalasia\") Esophageal narrowing such as from acid reflux or tumors Under normal circumstances, people rarely choke during a meal. Occasionally, food will stick in the esophagus for a few seconds (especially solid foods), but will pass spontaneously or can be washed down easily with liquids. But there are a number of symptoms that you should get checked for a possible swallowing problem, including: Frequent choking on food Hesitancy in food passage for more than a few seconds Pain when swallowing Recurring pneumonia (an indication that food may be going into the lungs rather than the esophagus) Immediate medical attention is needed when food becomes lodged in the esophagus for more than 15 minutes and doesn't pass spontaneously or with liquids. Some people don't know that they have swallowing problems, because they compensate unconsciously by choosing foods that are easier to eat, or they eat more slowly. However, untreated swallowing problems raises he risk for choking or having large pieces of solid food lodge in the esophagus. You may get tests such as: Cineradiography: An imaging test in which a camera is used to film internal body structures. During the test, you will be asked to swallow a barium preparation (liquid or other form that lights up under X-ray). This is often performed under the guidance of a speech pathologist, an expert in swallowing as well as speech. Upper endoscopy: A flexible, narrow tube (endoscope) is passed into the esophagus and projects images of the inside of the pharynx and esophagus on a screen for evaluation. Manometry: This test measures the timing and strength of esophageal contractions and muscular valve relaxation. Impedance and pH test: This test can determine if acid reflux is causing a swallowing problem. Sometimes, a swallowing problem will resolve itself without treatment. Complex swallowing problems may require treatment by a specialist or several specialists. If you have a chewing or swallowing problem there are several things you can do to make eating and drinking easier and safer, including: Positioning Sit upright at a 90-degree angle. Remain sitting upright or standing for 15 to 20 minutes after eating a meal. Stay focused on the tasks of eating and drinking. If food or liquid catches in your throat, cough gently or clear your throat, and swallow again before taking a breath. If thin liquids cause you to cough, thicken them with a liquid thickener (your speech pathologist can recommend one for you). You can also substitute thicker liquids for thin ones, such as nectar for juice and cream soup for plain broth."], [1521, "Dietary Supplements", "In the United States, dietary supplements are substances you eat or drink. They can be vitamins, minerals, herbs or other plants, amino acids (the individual building blocks of protein), or parts of these substances. Dietary supplements are widely available in the United States in health food stores, grocery stores, pharmacies, on the Internet, and by mail. Common dietary supplements include vitamins and minerals (such as vitamin C or a multivitamin), botanicals (herbs and plant products, such as St. John's wort), and substances that come from a natural source (such as omega-3 fatty acids). Makers of dietary supplements cannot legally say that dietary supplements can diagnose, cure, treat, or prevent disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate dietary supplements in the same way that it regulates medicine. Herbal medicines can also treat constipation, ease pain, or act as relaxants or stimulants. Research on some herbs and plant products has shown that they may have some of the same effects that conventional medicines do, while others may have no effect or may be harmful. Omega-3 fatty acids, for example, may help lower triglyceride levels. Researchers have found that some supplements do not help prevent or treat certain health problems. For example, beta-carotene and vitamin E do not lower risk of heart disease or heart attack. If you are unsure about the safety of a supplement or herb, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or dietitian. Always tell your doctor if you are using a dietary supplement or if you are thinking about combining a dietary supplement with your conventional medical treatment. It may not be safe to forgo your conventional medical treatment and rely only on a dietary supplement. When using dietary supplements, keep in mind the following. Like conventional medicines, dietary supplements may cause side effects, trigger allergic reactions, or interact with prescription and nonprescription medicines or other supplements you might be taking. The form of supplement that you buy in health food or grocery stores may not be the same as the form used in research. Other than for vitamins and minerals, the long-term effects of most dietary supplements are not known."], [1522, "Diet Programs", "If you've followed a fad diet, you have plenty of company. And if you did lose weight, did the pounds stay off once you went back to your usual way of eating? The best diet is not a diet at all, but a way of life that includes food you enjoy, exercise, and healthy habits. Just as a car needs the proper gasoline to make it run, a body needs a healthy diet to develop properly. That means the right balance of protein, carbohydrates, and fat -- as well as a host of other nutrients. When you go on a fad diet and exclude necessary nutrients, you're putting yourself at risk for becoming ill. Getting too little of any nutrient may not cause an immediate problem. Researchers have noted that from 1970 through the 1990s, portion sizes of hamburgers, burritos, tacos, french fries, sodas, ice cream, pie, cookies, and salty snacks increased -- whether the foods were eaten at home or at restaurants. An ounce of meat or cheese is about the same as the size of your thumb from base to tip. 3 ounces of meat, fish, or poultry (a normal serving) is about the size of your palm. 1 to 2 ounces of nuts equals your cupped hand. Here are some simple tricks to scale back your portions (and calories): Serve your meals on salad plates instead of large dinner plates. Make sure your diet includes lean protein; complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and \"good\" fats like omega-3 fats from fish and monounsaturated fats from avocados, nuts, and olives or olive oil. When you go on a fad diet and exclude necessary nutrients, you're putting yourself at risk for becoming ill. Getting too little of any nutrient may not cause an immediate problem. But if it's lacking for a long time, you may find you have health problems Say no to bad fats. Minimize how much saturated fat you get from animal sources, and eliminate trans fats from the fried foods, snacks, and fast-food products you eat. Eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Choose different colors of fruits and vegetables to ensure optimal nutrition. Toss out high-calorie, high-fat, sugary foods that will tempt you to overeat -- chips, cookies, crackers, ice cream, candy bars, and the like. Then, fill your fridge and cupboards with lean protein, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, good fats, and fat-free or low-fat dairy products. Try taking low fat cheese and whole-grain crackers to school or work for a snack, or eat a tablespoon of peanut butter with one slice of whole-grain bread. Pile on the salad and super servings of green beans, broccoli, cabbage, kale, or other low-calorie vegetables instead of high-fat foods, breads, pasta, and desserts. If you're still hungry after a meal and you want seconds, go for veggies. Dark berries (blueberries, blackberries, cherries, and raspberries) are rich in healthy antioxidants. They're also low in calories and fat and high in fiber. Steer clear of sugar-containing sodas and fruit drinks. If you need more information on weight loss and dieting, talk to your health care provider or a registered dietitian. Ask your doctor about your \"ideal\" weight and the number of calories you must eat to lose pounds and maintain an ideal weight. Also, ask friends, family, or co-workers to join you as you work to change your eating habits and pare down your weight."], [1523, "Diet for Children", "Healthy eating means eating a variety of foods so that your child gets the nutrients (such as protein, carbohydrate, fat, vitamins, and minerals) he or she needs for normal growth. If your child regularly eats a wide variety of basic foods, he or she will be well-nourished. With babies and toddlers, you can usually leave it to them to eat the right amount of food at each meal, as long as you make only healthy foods available. Things get more complicated at age 2 or 3, when children begin to prefer the tastes of certain foods, dislike the tastes of other foods, and have a lot of variation in how hungry they are. But even then it usually works best to make only healthy foods available and let your child decide how much to eat. One day a child may eat a big breakfast, a big lunch, and hardly any dinner. The next day this same child may eat very little at breakfast but may eat a lot at lunch and dinner. Don't expect your child to eat the same amount of food at every meal and snack each day. Many parents worry that their child is either eating too much or too little. Perhaps your child only wants to eat one type of food-peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, for instance. Your job is to offer nutritious food choices at meals and snack times. Your child's job is to choose how much he or she will eat of the foods you serve. If this idea is new to you, it may take a little time for both you and your child to adjust. In time, your child will learn that he or she will be allowed to eat as little or as much as he or she wants at each meal and snack. This will encourage your child to continue to trust his or her internal hunger gauge. Here are some ways you can help support your child's healthy eating habits: Eat together as a family as often as possible. Keep family meals pleasant and positive. Avoid making comments about the amount or type of food your child eats. Pressure to eat actually reduces children's acceptance of new or different foods. Make healthy food choices for your family's meals. Children notice the choices you make and follow your example. Eat at around the same times every day and always at the table, even for snacks. Do nothing else during the meal other than talking and enjoying each other-no TV or other distractions. Here are some other ways you can help your child stay healthy: Set limits on your child's daily television and computer time. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limiting TV and other screen time to 2 hours or less a day.1 Sit down with your child and plan out how he or she will use this time allowance. For example, walk your child to and from school and take a walk after dinner. Teach your young child how to skip, hop, dance, play catch, ride a bike, and more. Encourage your older child to find his or her favorite ways to be active. You can use this time to discuss with a doctor your child's growth rate, activity level, and eating habits. Poor eating habits can develop in otherwise healthy children for several reasons. If candy and soft drinks are always available, most children will choose these foods rather than a more nutritious snack. You can include some less nutritious foods as part of your child's meals so that he or she learns to enjoy them along with other foods. Try to keep a variety of nutritious and appealing food choices available. Healthy and kid-friendly snack ideas include: String cheese.Whole wheat crackers and peanut butter.Air-popped or low-fat microwave popcorn.Frozen juice bars made with 100% real fruit.Fruit and dried fruit.Baby carrots with hummus or bean dip.Low-fat yogurt with fresh fruit. Frozen juice bars made with 100% real fruit. Power struggles between a parent and child can affect eating behavior. Your child can decide what and how much he or she will eat from the choices you offer. A child's sadness, anxiety, or family crisis can cause undereating or overeating. If your child is healthy and eating a nutritious and varied diet, yet seems to eat very little, he or she may simply need less food energy (calories) than other children. And some children need more daily calories than others the same age or size, and they eat more than you might expect. If your child has a medical condition that affects how he or she eats, talk with your child's doctor about how you can help your child get the right amount of nutrition. A child with poor eating habits is going to be poorly nourished. That means he or she won't be getting the amounts of nutrients needed for healthy growth and development. Poor eating habits include: Eating a very limited variety of foods. Eating too many foods of poor nutritional quality, such as soft drinks, chips, and doughnuts. Overeating from being served large portions or being told to \"clean your plate\" or \"finish it all up.\""], [1524, "Diarrhea", "When you have diarrhea, your bowel movements (or stools) are loose and watery. It normally lasts 2 to 3 days, and you can treat it with over-the-counter medicines. Some people get it more often as part of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or other conditions. You may have: Bloating in your belly Cramps Thin or loose stools Watery stools An urgent feeling that you need to have a bowel movement Nausea and throwing up More serious symptoms include: Blood or mucus in your stool Weight loss Fever If you have watery stools more than three times a day and you're not drinking enough fluids, you could become dehydrated. Other causes include: Alcohol abuse Allergies to certain foods Diabetes Diseases of the intestines (such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) Eating foods that upset the digestive system Infection by bacteria (the cause of most types of food poisoning) or other organisms Laxative abuse Medications Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) Radiation therapy Running (Some people get \"runner's diarrhea\" for reasons that aren't clear) Some cancers Surgery on your digestive system Trouble absorbing certain nutrients, also called \"malabsorption\" Diarrhea may also follow constipation, especially for people who have irritable bowel syndrome.

You should drink at least six 8-ounce glasses of fluids each day. Chicken broth (without the fat), tea with honey, and sports drinks are also good choices. Instead of drinking liquids with your meals, drink liquids between meals. And you may have itching, burning, or pain when you go to the bathroom. Afterwards, pat the area dry (do not rub) with a clean, soft towel. You may also want to use a hemorrhoid cream or white petroleum jelly on the affected area."], [1525, "Diaphragm Use and Care", "Women have been using the diaphragm for birth control in one form or another for hundreds of years. It's a small, flexible cup made of silicone or latex that goes inside the vagina to block sperm from reaching an egg. You need to use a diaphragm along with a cream or gel that kills sperm, called a spermicide. First squeeze about a tablespoon of spermicide inside the cup of the diaphragm and spread more around the rim. Fold the diaphragm in half, with your index finger inside to help guide it. The diaphragm should cover the narrow opening to your uterus, called the cervix, and the front edge should tuck behind your pubic bone. You can put it in up to 6 hours before you have sex, and you need to leave it in for at least 6 hours after. So if you put the diaphragm in hours ahead of time, remember to add more. Clean the diaphragm with soap and water, let it air dry, and store it in its case. How well a diaphragm prevents pregnancy depends a lot on whether you use it correctly. Six out of 100 women will get pregnant with the diaphragm if they use it perfectly every time. The most serious one is toxic shock syndrome, a condition you get from a bacterial infection. You can avoid it by not leaving a diaphragm in for more than 24 hours. The device also can cause irritation or a reaction if you're allergic to latex. And some women get urinary tract infections more often when they use a diaphragm. You need a prescription to get one, so see your doctor or other health care professional. She'll figure out the size you need and teach you how to put it in. It's not for everyone -- you can't use it if you have poor pelvic muscle tone or problems with the shape of your vagina. You'll have to replace it at least every 2 years or more often if it gets damaged. You may need a different size if you get pregnant, have pelvic surgery, or gain or lose more than 15 pounds. You can choose to use a diaphragm, even if your partner doesn't want to use a condom. If you want to try to get pregnant, just stop using it. Since you can put it in and apply spermicide an hour before you have sex, you don't have to interrupt the mood. The diaphragm may be a good choice for birth control if you want to avoid hormones and if you want something that you can easily reverse if you want to get pregnant. But you have to be able to use and take care of it properly and be at low risk for STDs."], [1526, "Diaper Rash", "Almost all babies develop a diaper rash -- an inflammation of the skin on the buttocks, genitals, and thighs -- at some time in their young lives. Although a diaper rash may cause a baby discomfort and even some pain, it is rarely serious. But sometimes a rash will persist, an indication that a secondary skin condition or infection has developed. Seborrheic dermatitis, an inflammatory skin condition, can trigger a diaper rash, as can thrush, or candidiasis, a type of yeast infection. Babies receiving antibiotics for other illnesses are particularly susceptible to candida-related diaper rash, because the drugs allow fungal growth."], [1527, "Diabetic Sick-Day Guidelines", "When you have diabetes, sick days often mean more than a runny nose and sneezing. An illness like a cold, the flu, or any condition that makes you throw up or gives you diarrhea can also boost your blood sugar. Test for ketones if you have type 1 diabetes and your sugar level is above 240mg/dL -- or if your doctor tells you to. Ketones are a form of waste that people with type 1 make when they're under stress (like an illness). Drink liquids if you can't keep solid food down. Have one cup of liquid every hour while you're awake to prevent dehydration. If you can't hold down liquids, you may need to go to the emergency room or hospital. You may need to eat or drink something with sugar so that your blood sugar doesn't drop too low. If you need an over-the-counter drug to control symptoms like cough and nasal congestion, ask your doctor or pharmacist for a list of sugar-free products. Eat or drink 30 to 50 grams of carbohydrates every 3 to 4 hours. That will keep your body nourished, stop if from making ketones, and prevent your blood sugar from dropping too low.

Or, you might just notice minor vision problems. When you do start having symptoms, you might notice: A loss of central vision when you read or drive Inability to see colors Blurry vision Holes or black spots in vision See your doctor right away if you have any of these issues. When left untreated, diabetic retinopathy damages your retina. Your eye will try to grow new blood vessels, but they won't develop well. This can cause another condition doctors call macular edema, which makes your vision blurry. An eye doctor can usually tell if you have diabetic retinopathy during an eye exam. He'll probably dilate your pupils to look for any changes in blood vessels or to see if new ones have grown. He'll also check to see if your retina is swollen or has become detached. Your doctor may recommend laser photocoagulation. It's not painful, but it might make it harder for you to see color or to see at night. If your blood vessels leak into your retina and vitreous humor (the jellylike substance that fills the eyeball), you may to have what doctors call a vitrectomy. Work with your doctor to keep your blood sugar and blood pressure at good levels. Make sure you see an eye doctor at least once a year for a complete eye exam.

Symptoms include: Tingling Numbness (which may become permanent) Burning (especially in the evening) Pain Early symptoms usually get better when your blood sugar is under control. Wear them all the time, so your feet don't get injured. In your digestive system: Symptoms include: Bloating Diarrhea Constipation Heartburn Nausea Vomiting Feeling full after small meals What you should do: You may need to eat smaller meals and take medication to treat it. You may also need to wear special stockings (ask your doctor about them) and take medicine. In Men: Symptoms include: He may not be able to have or keep an erection, or he may have \"dry\" or reduced ejaculations. What you should do: See your doctor, because there are other possible causes than diabetes. Treatment includes: Counseling Penile implant or injections Vacuum erection device Medication In Women: Symptoms include: Can include less vaginal lubrication and fewer or no orgasms. Treatments include: Vaginal estrogen creams, suppositories, and rings Medications to help sex not feel painful Lubricants In the Urinary System: Symptoms include: Trouble emptying your bladder Bloating Incontinence (leaking urine) More bathroom trips at night What you should do: Tell your doctor. Treatments may include: Medication Inserting a catheter into the bladder to release urine (self-catheterization) Surgery This type causes pain (usually on one side) in the thighs, hips, or buttocks. Most people with this condition need treatment, such as medication and physical therapy, for their weakness or pain. This type can appear suddenly and affect specific nerves, most often in the head, torso, or leg. Symptoms include: Double vision Eye pain Paralysis on one side of the face (Bell's palsy) Severe pain in a certain area, such as the lower back or leg(s) Chest or belly pain that is sometimes mistaken for another condition, such as heart attack or appendicitis What you should do: Tell your doctor about your symptoms.

The most common one is diabetic macular edema. That's a scary possibility, but knowing what to look out for and getting the right treatment can help protect your sight. Even if you don't notice problems, when you have diabetes, it's important you get your eyes checked every year. If you do have a problem, see an ophthalmologist right away. If you catch it early, there's a chance you can stop long-term damage. High blood sugar weakens the blood vessels in your eyes. That can make them leak or grow out of control in your retina, the light-sensitive area at the back of your eye. When fluid seeps into your retina, it can cause diabetic macular edema. The leaking makes your retina swell, which hampers the work of your macula, the special, sensitive part that gives you sharp vision. Diabetic macular edema doesn't always cause symptoms. But you may: Have images directly in front of you appear blurry or wavy See colors that seem \"washed out\" If this happens to you, see your doctor right away. Before any testing, your doctor may ask you questions: Have you noticed changes in your vision? Do you have high blood pressure or high cholesterol? You will need a thorough eye exam, which usually includes: A visual acuity test. Your doctor will use drops to widen your pupils and look at the inside of your eyes. He'll look for signs of disease, including damaged or leaking blood vessels, swelling, and fatty deposits on the retina. If your doctor thinks you have diabetic macular edema, you may also need one or both of these tests: A fluorescein angiogram (FA) takes pictures of your retina using a special dye that helps find any leaking blood vessels. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) uses a special camera to photograph your retina. Do you have experience treating diabetic macular edema? To treat diabetic macular edema, doctors may use drugs that are injected into your eyes to help stop leaking, and to slow the growth of new blood vessels. These drugs include: Avastin (bevacizumab) Eylea (aflibercept) Iluvien (fluocinolone acetonide) Lucentis (ranibizumab) Macugen (pegaptanib) In severe cases, you may also have laser photocoagulation. A doctor will use a tiny laser on your eye to seal leaking blood vessels. You may need more than one treatment to control the problem. It's usually not painful, but you may have slight stinging feeling when the laser touches you. This is usually done because of bleeding (not macular edema), and doctors take out the fluid that is clouding your vision and replace it with a clear solution. First, manage your diabetes by controlling your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol. Diet changes, keeping a healthy weight, and exercise can all help you manage these problems. Your doctor needs to see you to keep track of track of how your treatment is working. Ask him about resources in your area that can help you learn skills for living with vision loss.

The kidneys filter some of the sugar from the blood and remove it from the body through urine. Because the cells cannot receive sugar for energy, the body begins to break down fat and muscle for energy. When this happens, ketones, or fatty acids, are produced and enter the bloodstream, causing the chemical imbalance (metabolic acidosis) called diabetic ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis can be caused by not getting enough insulin, having a severe infection or other illness, becoming severely dehydrated, or some combination of these things. It can occur in people who have little or no insulin in their bodies (mostly people with type 1 diabetes but it can happen with type 2 diabetes, especially children) when their blood sugar levels are high. Your blood sugar may be quite high before you notice symptoms, which include: Flushed, hot, dry skin. Young children may lack interest in their normal activities. Laboratory tests, including blood and urine tests, are used to confirm a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis. Keep some test strips nearby in case your blood sugar level becomes high. When ketoacidosis is severe, it must be treated in the hospital, often in an intensive care unit. Treatment involves giving insulin and fluids through your vein and closely watching certain chemicals in your blood (electrolytes). It can take several days for your blood sugar level to return to a target range. Stress hormones released due to illness can raise your blood sugar. To prevent DKA when you are not feeling well, try to drink water, take your diabetes medicine, and eat a little food. If you are taking insulin, do a test for ketones."], [1532, "Diabetic Eye Disease", "You should plan to make regular eye doctor visits when you have diabetes. High blood sugar can lead to problems like blurry vision, cataracts, glaucoma, and retinopathy. In fact, diabetes is the primary cause of blindness in adults ages 20 to 74. To correct it, you need to get your blood sugar back into the target range (70-130 milligrams per deciliter, or mg/dL, before meals, and less than 180 mg/dL 1 to 2 hours after a meal). The lens allows your eye to see and focus on an image, just like a camera. Anyone can get them, but people with diabetes tend to get them earlier, and they get worse faster. When part of your lens is cloudy, your eye can't focus like it should. The doctor replaces the cloudy lens with an artificial one. This can damage nerves and blood vessels, and cause changes in vision. Medications can treat open-angle glaucoma, the most common form. They lower eye pressure, speed up drainage, and reduce the amount of liquid your eye makes. This type of glaucoma may not cause any symptoms until it's further along and you have major vision loss. Your doctor can catch it earlier, during an annual exam. With less common forms of the disease, you might notice: Headaches Eye aches or pain Blurred vision Watery eyes Halos around lights Vision loss Treatment can include medicine and special eye drops. Surgery and laser treatments can help with drainage. This makes new blood vessels grow on the iris, the colored part of your eye. They block the normal flow of fluid and raise eye pressure. Your doctor might try laser surgery to cut back on the vessels. The retina is a group of cells on the back of your eye that take in light. If you don't find and treat it early, you could go blind. If you keep your blood sugar under control, you lower your chances. People with type 1 diabetes rarely develop the condition before puberty. If you keep tight control of your blood sugar with either an insulin pump or multiple daily insulin injections, you're far less likely to get this condition. If you have type 2 diabetes, you may have signs of eye problems when you're diagnosed. Control your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol to slow or prevent the disease. There are other types of this condition: Background retinopathy. Your blood vessels are damaged, but you can still see OK. This is damage to the macula, a critical area of your retina. It happens when cells at the back of your eye don't get enough oxygen and new blood vessels start to grow. This can cause scars and pull your retina away from the back of your eye. If it gets detached, you could have vision loss that can't be fixed. It can prevent blindness in up to half the people with early retinopathy.

You may be able to prevent or reduce the severity of type 2 diabetes by staying at a healthy weight, eating healthy foods, and increasing your physical activity. Insulin helps your body properly use and store the sugar from the food you eat. When you are pregnant, the placenta makes hormones that can make it harder for insulin to work. Because gestational diabetes may not cause symptoms, it is important for you to be tested for gestational diabetes. Sometimes a pregnant woman who has symptoms has been living with another type of diabetes without knowing it. If you have symptoms from another type of diabetes, they may include: Increased thirst. Talk with your doctor if you have these symptoms, so that you can be tested for diabetes at any time during pregnancy. Most women are screened for gestational diabetes between the 24th and 28th weeks of pregnancy. Some women with gestational diabetes can control their blood sugar level by changing the way they eat and by exercising regularly. These healthy choices can also help prevent gestational diabetes in future pregnancies and type 2 diabetes later in life.

Babies and small children have an increased chance of becoming dehydrated because: A greater portion of their bodies is made of water. Children have a high metabolic rate, so their bodies use more water.

Spinal discs are soft, compressible discs that separate the interlocking bones (vertebrae) that make up the spine. The discs act as shock absorbers for the spine, allowing it to flex, bend, and twist. Herniated disc, an abnormal bulge or breaking open of a spinal disc. Spinal stenosis, the narrowing of the spinal canal , the open space in the spine that holds the spinal cord . These conditions may put pressure on the spinal cord and nerves, leading to pain and possibly affecting nerve function. As we age, our spinal discs break down, or degenerate, which may result in degenerative disc disease in some people. The jellylike material inside the disc (nucleus) may be forced out through the tears or cracks in the capsule, which causes the disc to bulge, break open (rupture), or break into fragments. A sudden (acute) injury leading to a herniated disc (such as a fall) may also begin the degeneration process. As the space between the vertebrae gets smaller, there is less padding between them, and the spine becomes less stable. Bone spurs can put pressure on the spinal nerve roots or spinal cord, resulting in pain and affecting nerve function. Degenerative disc disease may result in back or neck pain, but this varies from person to person. An affected disc in the neck area may result in neck or arm pain, while an affected disc in the lower back may result in pain in the back, buttock, or leg. The pain may start after a major injury (such as from a car accident), a minor injury (such as a fall from a low height), or a normal motion (such as bending over to pick something up). Degenerative disc disease is diagnosed with a medical history and physical exam. Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, injuries or illnesses, any previous treatment, and habits and activities that may be causing pain in the neck, arms, back, buttock, or leg. Look for areas of tenderness and any nerve-related changes, such as numbness, tingling, or weakness in the affected area, or changes in reflexes. If your exam reveals no signs of a serious condition, imaging tests, such as an X-ray, are unlikely to help the diagnosis. Imaging tests may be considered when your symptoms develop after an injury, nerve damage is suspected, or your medical history suggests conditions that could affect your spine, such as bone disease, tumors, or infection. To relieve pain, put ice or heat (whichever feels better) on the affected area and use acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen or naproxen. If you develop health problems such as osteoarthritis, a herniated disc, or spinal stenosis, you may need other treatments. In some cases, the bone is then permanently joined (fused) to protect the spinal cord. In rare cases, an artificial disc may be used to replace the disc that is removed."], [1542, "Dealing with Low Blood Sugar (Hypoglycemia)", "It can happen for several reasons, including diet, some medications and conditions, and exercise.

Examples of older drugs include: chlorpropamide (Diabinese) nateglinide (Starlix) repaglinide (Prandin) tolazamide (Tolinase) tolbutamide (Orinase) You can also get low blood sugar if you drink alcohol or take allopurinol (Zyloprim), aspirin, Benemid, probenecid (Probalan), or warfarin (Coumadin) with diabetes medications. You shouldn't get hypoglycemia if you take alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, biguanides (such as metformin), and thiazolidinediones alone, but it can happen when you take them with sulfonylureas or insulin. You can get low blood sugar if you take too much insulin for the amount of carbohydrates you eat or drink. For instance, it can happen: After you eat a meal that has a lot of simple sugars If you miss a snack or don't eat a full meal If you eat later than usual If you drink alcohol without eating any food Don't skip meals if you have diabetes, particularly if you're taking diabetes medications. If you have diabetes and think you have hypoglycemia, check your blood sugar level. If you get low blood sugar when you haven't eaten, have a snack before bedtime, such as a protein or a more complex carbohydrate. In that case, she may lower your insulin dose or change the time when you get your last dose of it.

If your blood sugar is still less than 70 mg/dL, eat another serving of one of the foods listed above. Glucagon is a prescription medicine that raises blood sugar, and you may need it if you have severe hypoglycemia. It's important that your family members and friends know how to give the injection in case you have a low blood sugar reaction. If you see someone having a severe hypoglycemic reaction, call 911 or take him or her to the nearest hospital for treatment. If you're driving and you have hypoglycemia symptoms, pull off the road, check your blood sugar, and eat a sugary food. Wait at least 15 minutes, check your blood sugar, and repeat these steps if necessary. If you have diabetes, ways you can prevent hypoglycemia include: Follow your meal plan.

Certain conditions, including age, illness, and genetics, may play a role in hearing loss. Modern life has added a host of ear-damaging elements to the list, including some medications and plenty of sources of loud, ongoing noise. With so many untreatable cases of hearing loss, prevention is the best way to keep hearing long-term. Advanced age is the most common cause of hearing loss. One out of three people age 65-74 has some level of hearing loss. It could be that lifetime exposure to noise and other damaging factors slowly wear down the ears' delicate mechanics. To understand the impact of noise, consider this: 44% of carpenters and 48% of plumbers report some hearing loss. Even musicians, who literally create music for our ears, are at risk for noise-induced hearing loss. More than 200 drugs and chemicals have a track record of triggering hearing and balance side effects in addition to their disease-fighting abilities. Some antibiotics Some chemotherapy drugs Aspirin Loop diuretics A drug used to treat malaria Several drugs for erectile dysfunction Sudden hearing loss, the rapid loss of 30 decibels or more of hearing ability, can happen over several hours or days. In nine out of 10 cases, sudden hearing loss affects only one ear. Though there are about 4,000 new cases of sudden hearing loss a year, doctors figure out the cause only 10% to 15% of the time. Illnesses such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes put ears at risk by interfering with the ears' blood supply. Otosclerosis is a bone disease of the middle ear, and Meniere's disease affects the inner ear. Trauma, especially a skull fracture or punctured eardrum, puts ears at serious risk for hearing loss. You may think that people are mumbling more, your spouse needs to speak up, and you need a better phone. As long as some sound still comes in, you could assume your hearing is fine. Mild hearing loss: One-on-one conversations are fine, but it's hard to catch every word when there's background noise. Moderate hearing loss: You often need to ask people to repeat themselves during conversations in person and on the phone. Severe hearing loss: Following a conversation is almost impossible unless you have a hearing aid. Profound hearing loss: You can't hear when other people speaking, unless they are extremely loud. You can't understand what they're saying without a hearing aid or cochlear implant. Early on, high-pitched sounds, such as children's and female voices, and the sounds \"S\" and \"F\" become harder to make out. You may also: Have trouble following a conversation when more than one person speaks at once Think other people are mumbling or not speaking clearly Often misunderstand what others say and respond inappropriately Get complaints that the TV is too loud Hear ringing, roaring, or hissing sounds in your ears, known as tinnitus It depends on the type and source of your hearing loss. Surgery may reverse hearing loss caused by otosclerosis, scar tissue, or infection, while Meniere's disease is sometimes treatable with medication and a different diet. If you think your hearing loss stems from medication use, talk with your doctor about drug options. Most people with permanent hearing loss can benefit from a hearing aid -- yet only one in five people who could use them do. You typically wear these tiny instruments in or behind your ear to make sounds louder. Things do sound different through a hearing aid though, so you should talk with your doctor to set realistic goals. Other sound-enhancing technologies include personal listening systems that allow you to tune in to what you want to hear and mute other sounds. Different kinds of phone-amplifying devices as well as captioned phones that let you read what your caller is saying make conversations possible on home and mobile phones. Let people know what they can do to help you understand them better: Get your attention before they start talking.

Abnormalities of structures of the brain may include hypoplasia of the corpus callosum (nerve fibers that connect the two hemispheres of the brain), underdeveloped nerve fibers (white matter) in any other location, and abnormal migration of neurons to the surface of the brain (cortical heterotopia). The pituitary gland is a hormone-producing gland at the base of the brain that controls hormones in the body that are necessary for growth, energy, and sexual development.

Other fingers may also be abnormally short (brachydactyly) and joints between certain bones of the fingers (proximal interphalangeal joints) may become fused (symphalangism), causing limited flexion and restricted movement of the finger joints. In addition, many children with the disorder experience limited extension, partial (subluxation) or complete dislocation, and/or permanent flexion and immobilization (contractures) of certain joints. In most infants with diastrophic dysplasia, there is also incomplete closure of bones of the spinal column (spina bifida occulta) within the neck area and the upper portion of the back (lower cervical and upper thoracic vertebrae). In addition, during the first year of life, some affected children may begin to develop progressive abnormal sideways curvature of the spine (scoliosis). During adolescence, individuals with the disorder may also develop abnormal front-to-back curvature of the spine (kyphosis), particularly affecting vertebrae within the neck area (cervical vertebrae). Some individuals may also be prone to experiencing partial dislocation (subluxation) of joints between the central areas (bodies) of cervical vertebrae, potentially resulting in spinal cord injury. In addition, most newborns with diastrophic dysplasia have or develop abnormal fluid-filled sacs (cysts) within the outer, visible portions of the ears (pinnae). Over time, the abnormal areas of tissue (lesions) may accumulate deposits of calcium salts (calcification) and eventually develop into bone (ossification).

The DASH diet calls for a certain number of servings daily from various food groups. The number of servings you require may vary, depending on how many calories you need per day. Then, once your body has adjusted to the diet, cut back to 1,500 milligrams of sodium per day (about 2/3 teaspoon). These amounts include all sodium eaten, including sodium in food products as well as in what you cook with or add at the table. Dash Diet Tips Add a serving of vegetables at lunch and at dinner.

When a blood clot forms in a vein deep inside your body, it causes what doctors call \"deep vein thrombosis\" (DVT). This is most likely to happen in your lower leg, thigh, or pelvis. That's why if you think you have one, you must see a doctor right away. But you might notice any of the following: Leg or arm swelling that comes on without warning Pain or soreness when you stand or walk Warmth in the area that hurts Enlarged veins Skin that looks red or blue If a blood clot breaks free and moves through your bloodstream, it can get stuck in a blood vessel of your lung. Doctors call this a pulmonary embolism, or PE. Signs of PE include: Shortness of breath Chest pain that's worse when you take a deep breath Coughing up blood Increased heart rate Many things can increase your chances of getting DVT. DVT can happen at any age, but your risk is greater after age 40. When you sit or lie down for long stretches of time, the muscles in your lower legs stay lax. This makes it hard for blood to circulate, or move around, like it should. Bed rest and long flights or car rides can put you at risk. Carrying a baby puts more pressure on the veins in your legs and pelvis. What's more, a clot can happen up to 6 weeks after you give birth. Irritable bowel disease, cancer, and heart disease can all increase your risk. Some conditions that run in families cause your blood to be thicker than normal or to clot more than it should. It also harms the lining of your blood vessels. The estrogen in these raises your blood's ability to clot. Your doctor will want to stop the blood clot from getting bigger or breaking off and heading towards your lungs. She'll also want to reduce your chances of getting another DVT. This can be done in one of three ways: Medicine. If your symptoms are severe or your clot is very large, your doctor may give you a strong medicine to dissolve it. If you can't take a blood thinner or if one doesn't help, your doctor may insert a small, cone-shaped filter inside your inferior vena cava. The filter can catch a large clot before it reaches your lungs. These special knee socks are very tight at the ankle and get looser as they reach your knee. This pressure prevents blood from pooling in your veins. You can buy some types at the drug store. But your doctor may prescribe a stronger version that must be fitted by an expert. Simple lifestyle changes may help lower your odds of getting one. Try these simple tips to keep your blood circulating like it should: Take care of yourself. Stop smoking, lose weight, and get active. And, if your doctor has prescribed a medicine to control a health problem, take it as directed. If you're traveling for 4 hours or more, take breaks to flex and stretch your lower leg muscles. If you're on a flight, walk up and down the aisle every half hour. She might suggest you wear compression stockings or take blood thinners.

CF affects the cells in your body that make mucus, sweat, and digestive fluids. It can also cause severe lung damage like cysts (fluid-filled sacs) and fibrosis (scar tissue). It's caused by a mutation (change) in a single gene called the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR.) This controls the flow of salt and fluids in and out of your cells. If the CFTR gene doesn't work like it should, a sticky mucus builds up throughout your body. To get CF, you have to inherit a mutated copy of the gene from both your parents. That means there's a chance you could pass it on to your own child one day. Every time two CF carriers have a baby, there's a 25% (1 in 4) chance that their baby will be born with CF. The lungs aren't the only part of the body that's harmed by CF. The disease also affects the following organs: Pancreas: The thick mucus caused by CF blocks ducts in your pancreas. This stops digestive enzymes (proteins that break down your food) from reaching your intestine. As a result, your body has a hard time absorbing the nutrients it needs. Liver: If the tubes that remove bile become clogged, your liver gets inflamed and severe scarring (cirrhosis) occurs. Small intestine: Because breaking down high-acid foods that come from the stomach is a challenge, the lining of the small intestine can erode. Large intestine: Thick secretions (liquids) in your stomach can make feces (poop) very thick. In some cases, the intestine may also start to fold in on itself like an accordion (called \"intussusception\"). Bladder: Chronic coughing weakens the bladder muscles. Almost 65% of women with CF have what's called \"stress incontinence.\" These small, hard mineral deposits can cause nausea, vomiting, and pain. Most men with CF have problems with the tubes that transport their sperm, or what's called the \"vasa deferentia.\" Other parts of the body: CF can also lead to thinning of the bones (osteoporosis) and muscle weakness. Because it upsets the balance of minerals in the blood, it can also bring about low blood pressure, fatigue, a fast heart rate, and a general feeling of weakness."], [1559, "Cutis Laxa-Growth Deficiency Syndrome", "Summary De Barsy syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by eye abnormalities, growth retardation, intellectual disability, a prematurely-aged appearance (progeroid features), and loose (lax), wrinkled, sagging, redundant skin that lacks elasticity (cutis laxa). The specific symptoms present and the severity of de Barsy syndrome can vary greatly from one individual to another. Some cases of de Barsy syndrome have been linked to mutations in either the PYCR1 or ALDH18A1 genes; in other cases, a specific genetic mutation has not yet been identified. Introduction De Barsy syndrome was first reported in the medical literature by Dr. De Barsy in 1968 in one patient. The disorder is now classified as a form of cutis laxa and also known as autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 3. Cutis laxa is a group of rare disorders that may occur in several inherited (congenital) forms or acquired at some point during life (acquired cutis laxa). Cutis laxa is characterized by skin that is loose (lax), wrinkled, sagging, redundant, and lacking elasticity (inelastic). Cutis laxa syndromes were once broken down mainly by clinical characteristics, but are now classified based upon the specific mutation present. Consequently, individuals with de Barsy syndrome caused by a PYCR1 mutation are said to have PYCR1-related cutis laxa (autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 3B) and individuals with de Barsy syndrome caused by an ALDH18A1 mutation are said to have ALDH18A1-related cutis laxa (autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 3A). NORD has a general report on cutis laxa that explains the various subtypes and genetics of cutis laxa. In ALDH18A1-related de Barsy syndrome, approximately one third of ALDH18A1 mutation carriers show biochemical signs of metabolic disease due to ALDH18A1 related abnormal purine synthesis in blood. Young patients might present with symptoms of elevated levels of ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia) and secondary urea cycle disturbance."], [1560, "Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphomas", "Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) are a group of disorders characterized by abnormal accumulation of malignant T-cells in the skin potentially resulting in the development of rashes, plaques and tumors. CTCLs belong to a larger group of disorders known as non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs), which are related malignancies (cancers) that affect the lymphatic system (lymphomas). There are two main types of lymphocytes: B-lymphocytes, which may produce specific antibodies to \"neutralize\" certain invading microorganisms, and T-lymphocytes, which may directly destroy microorganisms or assist in the activities of other lymphocytes. In some cases, malignant lymphocytes may spread to affect the lymph nodes and eventually to other bodily tissues and organs, potentially resulting in life-threatening complications. The specific symptoms and physical findings may vary from case to case, depending upon the extent and region(s) of involvement, the specific type of CTCL present, and various additional factors. Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, such as CTCLs, may also be categorized based upon certain characteristics of the cancer cells as seen under a microscope and how quickly they may tend to grow and spread. For example, CTCLs may be characterized as \"low-grade\" (or indolent) lymphomas, which tend to grow slowly and result in few associated symptoms, or \"intermediate-grade\" or \"high-grade\" (aggressive) lymphomas, which typically grow rapidly, requiring prompt treatment."], [1561, "Curvature of the Spine (Scoliosis)", "If you look at someone's back, you'll see that the spine runs straight down the middle. But anything that measures more than 10 degrees is considered scoliosis. In as many as 80% of cases, doctors don't find the exact reason for a curved spine. Scoliosis without a known cause is what doctors call \"idiopathic.\" Doctors divide those curves into two types -- structural and nonstructural. In nonstructural scoliosis, the spine works normally, but looks curved. There are a number of reasons, such as one leg's being longer than the other, muscle spasms, and inflammations like appendicitis. In structural scoliosis, the curve of the spine is rigid and can't be reversed. Causes include: Cerebral palsy Muscular dystrophy Birth defects Infections Tumors Genetic conditions like Marfan syndrome and Down syndrome Congenital scoliosis begins as a baby's back develops before birth. Problems with the tiny bones in the back, called vertebrae, can cause the spine to curve. Doctors may detect this condition when the child is born. Family history and genetics can also be risk factors for idiopathic scoliosis. Scoliosis shows up most often during growth spurts, usually when kids are between 10 and 15 years old. About the same number of boys and girls are diagnosed with minor idiopathic scoliosis. But curves in girls are 10 times more likely to get worse and may need to be treated. It usually develops in the lower back as the disks and joints of the spine begin to wear out as you age. So forget the rumors you may have heard, such as, \"Childhood sports injuries can cause scoliosis.\" While heavy backpacks may cause back, shoulder, and neck pain, they don't lead to scoliosis. The way a person stands or sits doesn't affect their chances for scoliosis. But a curved spine may cause a noticeable lean."], [1562, "Curschmann-Batten-Steinert Syndrome", "Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant, multi-system disorder that affects both smooth and skeletal muscles and may affect the central nervous system, heart, eyes, and/or endocrine systems.

Classic DM1 is characterized by muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy), cataracts, myotonia and abnormalities in the heart's conduction of electrical impulses. Congenital DM1 is characterized by muscle weakness (hypotonia), difficulty breathing, mental retardation and early death. Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2), formerly called proximal myotonic myopathy (PROMM) is an autosomal dominant disorder with symptoms that are similar to DM1, but tend to be milder and more variable than DM1.

Also called \"ice\" or \"glass,\" it's a popular party drug. Usually, users smoke crystal meth with a small glass pipe, but they may also swallow it, snort it, or inject it into a vein. People say they have a quick rush of euphoria shortly after using it. During World War II, soldiers were given meth to keep them awake. People have also taken the drug to lose weight and ease depression. Today, the only legal meth product is a tablet for treating obesity and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Crystal meth is made with the ingredient pseudoephedrine, which is found in many cold medicines. Because it's used to make meth, the federal government closely regulates products with this ingredient. Making meth is a dangerous process because of the chemicals involved. The powerful rush people get from using meth causes many to get hooked right from the start. When it's used, a chemical called dopamine floods the parts of the brain that regulate feelings of pleasure. A user can become addicted quickly and soon finds he will do anything to have the rush again. Meth can make a user's body temperature rise so high he could pass out or even die. A user may feel anxious and confused, be unable to sleep, have mood swings, and become violent. His skin may dull, and he can develop hard-to-heal sores and pimples. He may have a dry mouth and stained, broken, or rotting teeth. A meth user is at higher risk for HIV/AIDS. The drug can affect judgment and lessen inhibitions. Someone under the influence of the drug may be more likely to engage in risky behaviors, such as unsafe sex. Consider these signs: Not caring about personal appearance or grooming Obsessively picking at hair or skin Loss of appetite and weight loss Dilated pupils and rapid eye movement Strange sleeping patterns -- staying up for days or even weeks at a time Jerky, erratic movements; twitching; facial tics; animated or exaggerated mannerisms; and constant talking Borrowing money often, selling possessions, or stealing Angry outbursts or mood swings Psychotic behavior, such as paranoia and hallucinations Meth addiction is one of the hardest drug addictions to treat, but it can be done.

If it doesn't appear until later in life, it will cause double vision. If either one happens, see a doctor immediately. Young children can suppress vision in a weaker eye, which lets them avoid double vision. However, that may lead to \"lazy eye,\" a condition your doctor will refer to as amblyopia. Depth perception and peripheral vision (vision off to the side) may be affected. If your eyes cross when you're older, you may start to turn your head to see in certain directions and avoid double vision. If you don't, the condition could continue into adulthood. Talk to a pediatric ophthalmologist, an eye doctor who specializes in working with kids. He may start treatment with eyeglasses or a patch to force your child to use the off-kilter eye until he sees normally. Glasses may solve the problem.

To help keep your child safe, use recommended equipment properly and update features of the crib as your child grows. If a crib does not meet current safety standards, your baby may be injured. A child's head, hands, arms, or legs can get stuck. A physically active child can loosen these structures, and the crib can collapse. Babies can get lead poisoning from chewing and gnawing on a crib with lead-based paint. And if a crib has missing or broken parts, don't use the crib and don't try to fix it yourself. For more information on crib safety, call the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) at 1-800-638-2772. Injuries can also occur as your child grows bigger. You should not be able to fit more than two fingers in the space between the mattress and crib. Also, remove any plastic covering from the mattress. Help prevent your child from falling out of the crib, the leading cause of crib accidents, by adjusting the mattress level as he or she grows. Start lowering the mattress no later than when your child begins to sit with little help. Adjust the mattress to its lowest setting by the time your baby can stand. Do not place the crib near drapes or blinds. (89 cm) tall, he or she has outgrown the crib and should sleep in a bed. Remove mobiles and activity gyms from the crib by the time your child can push up on his or her hands and knees or is 5 months of age, whichever comes first. These are strangulation hazards for children who can get on their hands and knees. Keep soft items and loose bedding out of the crib. Items such as blankets, stuffed animals, toys, and pillows could suffocate or trap your baby. Movable side rails are a safety hazard, and new cribs are no longer made with them. If your crib has the kind of side rail that can be raised and lowered, always raise it and secure it properly when your child is in the crib."], [1566, "Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease", "Also called \"classic\" CJD, it worsens quickly. Most people die within a year of getting it. Seen through a microscope, it makes the brain look like a sponge. It's also not linked to \"variant\" CJD, which comes from products made from cattle that had mad cow disease. There are three types of classic CJD. Prion proteins are a normal part of your body. Familial: This happens in people who inherit a bad gene from a parent. Only 10% to 15% of CJD cases each year are familial. Acquired: The rarest form, It happens when someone comes into contact with a medical instrument (like a scalpel), organ (by transplantation), or growth hormone that's infected with CJD. It makes up less than 1% of classic CJD cases. People with CJD often have signs of dementia, including: Confusion Trouble walking Jerky muscle movements or twitching Personality changes Trouble with memory and judgment Vision problems Sometimes people with it have trouble sleeping or become depressed. In later stages of the disease, they often lose the ability to speak or move. They may also get pneumonia or other infections, or slip into a coma. One sign of the disease is how fast it gets worse. A few tests doctors can use include: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Doctors use a long, very thin needle to draw some of the fluid out of the spinal column to test for certain proteins. The only way to know for sure someone has CJD is by taking a sample (called a biopsy) of their brain tissue, or by autopsy. Doctors don't usually biopsy brain tissue, because it's risky, both for the patient and the doctor. Since a positive diagnosis doesn't help someone with CJD, doctors often confirm cases only after someone dies of it. Researchers have tested several drugs, but none have been able to slow or stop the disease.

In rare cases it causes pressure on the baby's brain, which can cause damage. A baby's skull is not just one bowl-shaped piece of bone. The sutures let the skull expand as the brain grows. Over time, the sutures harden and close the skull bones together. When a baby has craniosynostosis, one or more of these sutures close too soon. How the problem affects your baby depends in part on how many of the sutures close too soon: If only one suture closes too soon, the baby's brain usually develops normally, but the head has an odd shape. If more than one suture closes too soon, the baby's brain may not be able to grow as fast as it should. If severe pressure builds up around the brain, it may cause brain damage, seizures, blindness, and developmental delays. Craniosynostosis is more likely in: Babies who lie in a breech position while in the uterus. The most common sign is an oddly shaped head at birth or by the time the child is a few months old. An oddly shaped head may be the only sign of craniosynostosis. In rare cases, the disease causes pressure to build up on the baby's brain. This can cause brain damage and can make the baby develop more slowly than other children. If you know that your baby has this condition, call your doctor right away if your baby: Starts vomiting. Has swollen eyes or has problems moving the eyes or following objects. You or your doctor may notice that your baby has an odd-shaped head at birth, shortly after birth, or later at a well-child checkup. Just because your baby has an oddly shaped head doesn't mean that he or she has craniosynostosis. Head shape may be affected by how your baby was positioned in your uterus, the birth process, or your baby's sleep position. Talk to your doctor if you are concerned about the shape of your baby's head. Your doctor will: Look at each side of your baby's face and head. Feel the top and sides of the head, where sutures are located, for unusual ridges or bumps. Your baby's doctor may also order a skull X-ray, CT scan, or MRI. The surgeon removes strips of bone in the skull to create artificial sutures. This surgery prevents or relieves pressure on the brain and allows the skull to expand normally. If there is pressure on the brain, your child needs surgery right away. If your baby doesn't seem to have pressure on the brain, your doctor may advise you to wait and see if the head shape returns to normal without surgery. Being involved in your baby's care while he or she is in the hospital may help you feel more comfortable when you take your baby home.

Cradle cap (also called infantile seborrheic dermatitis) is a rash that begins as scaling and redness on a baby's scalp. Seborrheic dermatitis is common in infants, usually beginning in the first weeks of life and slowly disappearing over a period of weeks or months. The precise cause of the rash is not known; however, Pityrosporum ovale (a yeast) is believed to play a role in this condition. Medicated shampoos (dandruff shampoos containing sulfur and 2% salicylic acid) may loosen the scales, but these shampoos can cause irritation and should be used only after consulting a pediatrician. Additional medications, such as topical steroids, may be prescribed to treat the scales and redness. A stronger medicated shampoo may be needed in some cases, but seek the advice of your doctor regarding the use of these shampoos. Roseola is a viral illness that usually affects children between the ages of 6 months and 2 years. It is typically marked by several days of high fever, followed by a pinkish-red flat or raised rash that appears on the child's trunk and spreads over the body just as the fever breaks. However, HHV-6 and HHV-7 do not cause the cold sores and genital herpes infections that HSV can cause. Roseola is contagious and spreads through tiny drops of fluid from the nose and throat of infected people. The child may be fussy or irritable during this time, may have a weak appetite, and may have swollen glands (lymph nodes) in the neck or the back of the head. In many cases, the high fever abruptly stops and a rash appears on the child's body at about the same time. The rash is made up of flat or raised pinkish-red spots and appears on the torso. A diagnosis of roseola is often uncertain until the fever goes down and a rash appears. As a result, the doctor may order tests to make sure that the fever is not caused by another type of infection. Acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen (such as Advil or Motrin) can help to reduce your child's fever. Avoid giving aspirin to a child because the use of aspirin in such cases has been associated with the development of Reye's syndrome, which can lead to liver failure. A sponge or towel soaked in cool water may help comfort the child until the fever drops. Call your child's doctor if your child is lethargic, not drinking, or if you cannot keep his fever down. Therefore, it is thought that exposure to roseola in childhood may provide some lasting immunity to the illness. The condition results in a facial rash that looks like the cheeks have been slapped. Fifth disease rarely causes harm to an unborn child, but pregnant woman should be monitored in case they haven't developed immunity to the virus. Symptoms of fifth disease include: Flu- and cold-like symptoms such as coughing, runny nose, fever, generalized aches and pains in joints and muscles, loss of appetite, and irritability A facial rash that looks as if the cheeks have been slapped; the rash is not painful but is warm to the touch. Spreading of the rash to the thighs and arms Aches in joints are sometimes seen in adults, rarely in children. In most cases, a doctor can diagnose fifth disease by seeing the typical rash during a physical exam. To confirm the diagnosis, a blood test may be done to look for antibodies to parvovirus.

With this condition, you may get symptoms like bloody bowel movements or diarrhea. You may alternate between periods of flare-ups -- when the symptoms are active -- and remission -- when they disappear. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are called inflammatory bowel disease because they cause inflammation of the bowel. In UC, inflammation usually begins in the rectum -- the lowest part of the large intestine that ends at the anus -- and then spreads to other parts of your colon. If the problem is only in the rectum, the disease may be called ulcerative proctitis. Symptoms of ulcerative colitis may include: Blood or pus in diarrhea Dehydration Belly pain Fever Painful, urgent bowel movements When you have UC, you may also lose weight and have skin disorders, joint pain or soreness, eye problems, anemia (fewer red blood cells), blood clots, and a higher risk for colon cancer. An infection with a virus or bacteria in your colon may trigger the inflammation that's linked with the disease. UC is most common in the U.S. and Northern Europe and in people of Jewish descent. Up to 20% of people with inflammatory bowel disease have a first-degree relative (mother, father, brother, or sister) with the condition. You may get a variety of tests that help your doctor figure out if you have UC or another condition. He may ask you to get one or more of these tests: Endoscopy, such as colonoscopy or proctosigmoidocopy Blood tests Stool samples X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs Treatment for ulcerative colitis can include medicine, changes in your diet, or surgery. These treatments won't cure your ulcerative colitis, unless you have surgery that removes the colon and rectum, which is considered curative, but they can help ease your symptoms. It's important to get treated for ulcerative colitis as soon as you start having symptoms. If you have severe diarrhea and bleeding, you might need to go the hospital to prevent or treat dehydration, reduce your symptoms, and make sure you're getting the right nutrition. Your doctor may suggest several types of medicines to curb inflammation in your bowel, including sulfa drugs, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and antibiotics. These medicines sometimes have side effects and long-term complications, so doctors often suggest them for short periods of time to help you get in remission. Your doctor may then prescribe you a 5-ASA medication to keep your symptoms away for a longer period. If corticosteroids or 5-ASA drugs don't help, your doctor may prescribe these kinds of drugs, such as 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), azathioprine (Imuran), cyclosporine, and tacrolimus (Prograf). This group of drugs includes adalimumab (Humira), adalimumab-atto (Amjevita), a biosimilar to Humira, certolizumab pegol (Cimzia), golimumab (Simponi), infliximab (Remicade), infliximab-dyyb (Inflectra), a biosimilar to Remicade, vedolizumab (Entyvio), and others. While food doesn't appear to play a role in causing ulcerative colitis, certain foods may cause more symptoms when your disease is active. Your doctor may suggest this if your medicine isn't working, your symptoms get worse, or your ulcerative colitis leads to serious complications. When you have an operation to remove your entire colon, the surgeon most often creates an opening, or stoma, in your belly wall. A newer surgery, called a pelvic pouch or ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA), doesn't create a permanent opening. Instead, a surgeon removes your colon and rectum, and your small intestine is used to form an internal pouch or reservoir that serves as a new rectum. A procedure called a continent ileostomy (Kock pouch) is done if you want your external pouch converted to an internal one, or if you can't get the IPAA operation. He makes an opening in your belly wall and joins the reservoir to your skin with a nipple valve. If you have been told you need surgery to treat ulcerative colitis, you may want to get a second opinion to make sure you get the best option for you.

In individuals with CAHA, the red blood cells are destroyed prematurely and the rate of production of new cells in the bone marrow can no longer compensate for their loss. The severity of the anemia is determined by the length of time that the red blood cells survive and by the rate at which the bone marrow continues to create new red blood cell production.

Cold antibody hemolytic anemia may also occur as a secondary disorder in association with a number of different underlying disorders such as certain infectious diseases (e.g., mycoplasma infection, mumps, cytomegalovirus, infectious mononucleosis), immunoproliferative diseases (e.g., non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia), or connective tissue disorders (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus)."], [1577, "Cohen Syndrome", "Cohen syndrome is an extremely variable genetic disorder characterized by diminished muscle tone (hypotonia), abnormalities of the head, face, hands and feet and mental retardation. Affected individuals usually have heads that are smaller than average and a short upper lip through which the incisors are exposed. Cohen syndrome is an autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by an abnormal gene located on chromosome 8 at 8q22-q23."], [1578, "Coffin Lowry Syndrome", "Coffin-Lowry syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by mental retardation; abnormalities of the head and facial (craniofacial) area; large, soft hands with short, thin (tapered) fingers; short stature; and/or various skeletal abnormalities. Characteristic facial features may include an underdeveloped upper jawbone (maxillary hypoplasia), an abnormally prominent brow, downslanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), large ears, and/or unusually thick eyebrows. Skeletal abnormalities may include abnormal front-to-back and side-to-side curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis) and unusual prominence of the breastbone (sternum) (pectus carinatum)."], [1579, "Coenzyme Q10", "Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a substance similar to a vitamin. Your body makes CoQ10, and your cells use it to produce energy your body needs for cell growth and maintenance. CoQ10 is naturally present in small amounts in a wide variety of foods, but levels are particularly high in organ meats such as heart, liver, and kidney, as well as beef, soy oil, sardines, mackerel, and peanuts. Coenzymes help enzymes work to digest food and perform other body processes, and they help protect the heart and skeletal muscles. CoQ10 is available in the United States as a dietary supplement. It is said to help heart failure, as well as cancer, muscular dystrophy, and periodontal disease. Some people take it to help reduce the effects certain medicines can have on the heart, muscles, and other organs. Only some of the studies of coenzyme Q10 showed that it helps heart failure symptoms.1 In 1961, scientists saw that people with cancer had little CoQ10 in their blood. They found low CoQ10 blood levels in people with myeloma, lymphoma, and cancers of the breast, lung, prostate, pancreas, colon, kidney, and head and neck. Some research has suggested that CoQ10 helps the immune system and may be useful as a secondary treatment for cancer. Three studies examined the use of CoQ10 along with conventional treatment for cancer. The three studies contained a total of 41 women with breast cancer. But the National Cancer Institute (NCI) rates the strength of the evidence for CoQ10 and cancer as weak.2 Research does not support a helpful effect of CoQ10 in periodontal (gum) disease, muscular dystrophy, or exercise recovery. Taking 100 mg a day or more of CoQ10 has caused mild insomnia in some people. And research has detected elevated levels of liver enzymes in people taking doses of 300 mg per day for long periods of time. Medicines for high cholesterol (statins) and medicines that lower blood sugar cause a decrease of CoQ10 levels and reduce the effects of CoQ10 supplements. CoQ10 can reduce the body's response to the blood thinner (anticoagulant) medicine warfarin (Coumadin) and can decrease insulin requirements in people with diabetes. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate dietary supplements in the same way it regulates medicines. When using dietary supplements, keep in mind the following: Like conventional medicines, dietary supplements may cause side effects, trigger allergic reactions, or interact with prescription and nonprescription medicines or other supplements you might be taking. Because of this, how well they work or any side effects they cause may differ among brands or even within different lots of the same brand. The form of supplement that you buy in health food or grocery stores may not be the same as the form used in research. Other than for vitamins and minerals, the long-term effects of most dietary supplements are not known."], [1580, "Cockayne Syndrome Type II", "Cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal (COFS) syndrome is a genetic degenerative disorder of the brain and spinal cord that begins before birth. The disorder is characterized by growth failure at birth and little or no neurological development, structural abnormalities of the eye and fixed bending of the spine and joints. COFS is now considered to be part of the spectrum of disorders within Cockayne syndrome."], [1581, "Cochlear Implants", "If you're very hard of hearing or deaf, a cochlear implant may help you get back the sounds you miss. It isn't a hearing aid, which makes sounds louder. It's a small device that a doctor puts in your ear through surgery. The implant doesn't make you hear normally again, but it can help you with sounds. Most people with severe to profound hearing loss can understand speech in person or over the phone better than they did with a hearing aid. Many people also can pick up on speech in noisy places better than they did with hearing aids, or even enjoy music again. That condition typically involves damage to tiny hair cells in a part of your inner ear called the cochlea. A cochlear implant skips the damaged hair cells and sends signals to the auditory nerve directly. The other, the speech processor, you wear behind your ear like a hearing aid. The outside part is slightly larger than a normal behind-the-ear hearing aid. You wear a microphone, which looks like a hearing aid, behind your ear. The processor may be connected to the microphone and worn at your ear, or you might wear it somewhere else on your body, depending on how active you are, your age, or your lifestyle. When there are sounds around you, the microphone and processor pick them up and change them into electrical impulses. Some of the pros: You may be able to hear speech at a nearly normal level. Problems can include bleeding, infections, and side effects from the medicine that sends you to sleep during the procedure. Other possible complications include: A nerve injury that changes your sense of taste Nerve damage that causes weakness or paralysis in your face Dizziness or balance problems Loss of the hearing you have left Ringing in your ears, called tinnitus Leaks of the fluid around the brain The device doesn't work or gets infected, which may mean you'll have to remove and replace the implant. Children and people with abnormally formed inner ears seem to be at higher risk. The FDA and CDC recommend vaccines for anyone who gets a cochlear implant to lower their risk for the disease. Keep some other things in mind, too: If you have some hearing left, sound may seem \"mechanical\" or \"synthetic,\" although most people no longer notice this after several months. If you need an MRI, you may first need a simple procedure to briefly take out the magnet in the cochlear implant. There's also a type of cochlear implant that has a magnet you don't need to take out in order to have an MRI. You need to take off the speech processor before you bathe, shower, or swim. You also can cover that part with a waterproof case or choose a waterproof cochlear implant processor. Rarely, the implant may stop working, and you'd need surgery to fix the problem. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association says the device is best for adults who have: Severe to profound hearing loss in both ears Hearing loss after they've already learned speech and language Limited help from hearing aids No medical problems that would make surgery risky A strong desire to hear better A good understanding of what the device will -- and won't -- do for them Also, cochlear implants work better for people who have lost their hearing recently, as well as those who've already used a hearing aid successfully. The FDA says children can get the devices starting at age 1. Most kids who are diagnosed with significant hearing loss as babies get them as soon as possible. A cochlear implant in early childhood exposes children to sound during the critical period when they learn speech and language skills. The devices work best for children who: Have profound hearing loss in both ears Get limited help from hearing aids Are healthy, with no medical problems that would make surgery risky Are ready to learn how to communicate with a cochlear implant Have support from their parents, teachers, and school programs to help them gain hearing skills Are younger than age 5 Join in intensive speech therapy and programs to teach speaking skills A study found that children who got a cochlear implant before 18 months old had major improvements in their hearing, speaking, and learning. But the devices also can help older children who lose their hearing after they've learned to talk. If you have severe or profound hearing loss, a team of experts at a cochlear implant center can help you decide if the device and surgery will work for you. The team works together to check you, do the surgery, and offer follow-up care. You may have tests, such as: An exam of your external, middle, and inner ear to check for infections or other issues Hearing tests such as an audiogram, a graph that charts how you respond to specific sounds A hearing aid evaluation CT or MRI scans to check the inner ear and hearing nerve. A physical exam A psychological exam to see if you can handle the changes that come with the implant. When you're thinking about getting a cochlear implant, counseling will help you know what you can expect from the device and make sure you understand what it takes to learn how to use the implant. Doctors always recommend that children who get implants go through this."], [1582, "Cluster Headaches", "Cluster headaches are a series of relatively short but extremely painful headaches every day for weeks or months at a time. Because of their seasonal nature, people often mistake cluster headaches for symptoms of allergies or business stress. We don't know what causes them, but we do know that a nerve in your face is involved, creating intense pain around one of your eyes. Cluster headaches can be more severe than a migraine, but they usually don't last as long. These are the least common type of headaches, affecting less than 1 in 1,000 people. Cluster headaches may disappear completely (go into remission) for months or years, but they can come back without any warning. You get a cluster headache when a specific nerve pathway in the base of your brain is activated. That signal seems to come from a deeper part of the brain called the hypothalamus, where the \"internal biological clock\" that controls your sleep and wake cycles lives. The nerve that's affected, the trigeminal nerve, is responsible for sensations such as heat or pain in your face. An underlying brain condition, such as a tumor or aneurysm, won't cause these headaches. The pain is almost always one-sided, and it stays on the same side during a period, the time when you're getting daily attacks. (When a new headache period starts, it might switch to the opposite side, but that's rare.) A cluster headache lasts a short time -- usually 30 to 90 minutes, but maybe as little as 15 minutes or as long as 3 hours -- then disappears. Attacks appear to be linked to the circadian rhythm, your body's 24-hour clock. Most people will get daily headaches for 2 weeks to 3 months; in between these periods, they'll be pain-free for at least 2 weeks. Cluster headaches don't make you queasy or throw up. But it's possible for someone with cluster headaches to also get migraines, which can have those symptoms. Although the pain starts suddenly, you may catch a few subtle cues of the oncoming headache on the affected side: Discomfort or a mild burning sensation Swollen or drooping eye Smaller pupil in the eye Eye redness or watering Runny or congested nose Red, warm face You may begin to sweat a lot, or light may bother you. Cluster headaches are more common in people who smoke or are heavy drinkers. During a cluster period, you'll be more sensitive to alcohol and nicotine -- just a bit of alcohol can trigger a headache. The most successful ways to treat the pain are a shot of sumatriptan (Imitrex) and breathing oxygen through a face mask for 20 minutes. Your doctor can prescribe medication to shorten the length of the cluster as well as lessen the severity of your attacks, including: Divalproex sodium (Depakote) Ergotamine tartrate (Cafergot, Ergomar) Lithium Prednisone, for a short time Verapamil (Calan, Covera, Isoptin, Verelan) When nothing else has worked, surgery may be an option for people who don't get a break from cluster headaches."], [1583, "Clostridium Difficile Colitis", "Clostridium difficile (also called C. difficile) are bacteria that can cause swelling and irritation of the large intestine, or colon . You may get C. difficile colitis if you take antibiotics. But the infection is most common in people who are taking antibiotics or have taken them recently. It is also common in older people who are in hospitals and nursing homes and in people who are getting chemotherapy for cancer. Colitis caused by C. difficile can be mild or serious. If you take antibiotics to kill bacteria that do cause disease, your medicine may also kill the good bacteria. Experts also think that, in some cases, antibiotics may cause these toxins to be released. People who take medicines that reduce stomach acid, such as Nexium, Prevacid, or Prilosec, also have a greater risk of getting a C. difficile infection.1Your doctor can help you decide which medicines to keep or change. Other people can get infected if they touch a contaminated object and then eat or rub their faces with their hands. Health care workers can pass this bacteria from room to room in a hospital or a long-term care facility. The best way to prevent spreading C. difficile is to wash your hands often, especially after you use the bathroom. It is also a good idea to wash your hands before and after you visit a hospital, nursing home, or other place where people may be ill or weak. You also may have an abnormal heartbeat, especially if you become dehydrated from the diarrhea. In rare cases, a person who is very ill may develop a hole, or perforation, in the intestine. Your doctor may think you have C. difficile colitis if both of the following are true: You have symptoms of the illness. To confirm the diagnosis, a stool sample will be tested to look for the toxins that C. difficile produces. First, if possible, your doctor will have you stop taking the antibiotic that caused the infection. Your doctor may then treat C. difficile colitis with an antibiotic other than the one that caused the infection. Given as a shot in a vein, this medicine helps reduce the recurrence of a C. diff infection. If you have severe diarrhea, you also may be given fluids to prevent dehydration and to make sure you have the right amount of minerals (electrolytes) in your blood. Or you may get a medicine called a bile salt binder (such as cholestyramine) that can help control the diarrhea. For people who are not helped by antibiotics, a fecal transplant may be done. This treatment places stool from a donor into the colon of a person who has C. difficile infection. The good bacteria in the donor stool helps get rid of the C. difficile bacteria and restore health to the colon. Probiotics, which are bacteria that help keep the natural balance of organisms (microflora) in the intestines, may be helpful for people who have repeated C. difficile infections. In rare cases, a person might need surgery to remove part of the intestines."], [1584, "Cloning", "Stem cells are considered one of the greatest hopes for curing diseases like diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and paralysis caused by spinal cord injury. To put it all in perspective, WebMD asked some renowned scientists to explain precisely what cloning is and what it isn't. \"Clones are genetically identical individuals,\" says Harry Griffin, PhD. Griffin is assistant director of the Roslin Institute -- the lab in Edinburgh, Scotland, where Dolly the cloned sheep was created in 1997. Usually, after sperm and egg meet, the fertilized cell begins dividing. Remaining in a clump, the one becomes two, then four, eight, 16, and so on. Early on, says Griffin, the term cloning referred to embryo splitting -- doing in the lab what happens in the woman's body to create identical twins. \"It was first done in cattle, but there are one or two human examples.\" \"Twins were not deliberately created, but they certainly could be.\" \"The importance is that with nuclear transfer, you can copy an existing individual, and that's why there's controversy,\" says Griffin. When the process works, the manipulated cell -- coaxed by the newly-implanted genetic material -- begins to divide and eventually becomes a genetic replica of the adult-cell donor. Now, researchers in South Korea and the University of Michigan have cloned a human embryo. And it's sure to reignite the controversy of whether to ban all cloning or to allow some cloning for therapeutic purposes. Scientists have used the technology to cure a variety of diseases in mice. The scientists then used a technique called somatic nuclear transfer to remove the genetic material -- which contains the nucleus of each egg -- and replace it with the nucleus from the donor's ovarian cell. Then, using chemicals to trigger cell division, the researchers were able to create 30 blastocysts -- early-stage embryos that contain about 100 cells -- that were a genetic copy of the donor cells. Next, the researchers harvested a single colony of stem cells that have the potential to grow into any tissue in the body. Because they are the genetic match to the donor, they aren't likely to be rejected by the patient's immune system. \"Our approach opens the door for the use of these specially developed cells in transplantation medicine,\" says Woo Suk Hwang, a scientist who led the research in South Korea. \"The great vision of this field is to create personalized stem cells for individual patients,\" says Griffin. \"You'd take the cell from the patient and create the cell type you want -- say pancreatic islet cells for diabetics -- by transferring it to an egg, creating an embryo, and growing them.\" \"If there were enough women to donate enough eggs, and enough [funding], I'm certain it could be done,\" says Steven Stice, PhD, professor and GRE Eminent Scholar at the University of Georgia in Athens. \"But we collect hundreds of eggs a day from cattle to do our cloning. \"In the U.K., 120,000 people suffer from Parkinson's disease. The reality is that there simply are not enough eggs ... available to make therapeutic cloning a practical, routine therapy,\" says Griffin. And offering women money would still not yield the necessary numbers. \"Egg donation is akin to bone marrow transplantation as far as how unpleasant the process is for the donor,\" says Griffin. \"You'd have to produce an individual cell line for each person to avoid the immune response,\" says Stice. It will be very difficult to get to an application [of the technology] that won't cost hundreds of thousands of dollars [each time].\" In the end, both experts agree that therapeutic cloning is really unnecessary, given the existing supply of viable embryos left over from in vitro fertilization. \"They would be discarded,\" says Stice. \"They're donated with consent, and would never have gone on to form an individual. There are great opportunities with existing cell lines to get to the point of treating disease. For some, the technology is seen not as a source for stem cells to cure disease, but as a last, best hope for biological offspring, or, mistakenly and tragically, as a means of \"bringing back\" a lost spouse, child, or other loved one. First of all, says Griffin, \"only about 1 to 2% of cloned animals make it to live birth.\" And you can't even extrapolate that number to humans, because cows and sheep get pregnant much more easily than do women. Sure, there are healthy animal clones that appear to be normal. From a safety point of view alone, no one should be attempting to clone a child,\" says Griffin. Even if technology advances to the point where human reproductive cloning, as it's called, were a viable option -- and as you've seen, we're not even close -- anyone suggesting that cloning can duplicate an existing human being is just plain wrong, says Stice. In fact, says Stice, your clone would be \"even less [like you] than your twin. Most twins are raised in similar environments, whereas a clone of an adult will most likely have different experiences and different environmental factors affecting them [as they grow].\""], [1585, "Cleft Lip", "Cleft lip and cleft palate are facial and oral malformations that occur very early in pregnancy, while the baby is developing inside the mother. Clefting results when there is not enough tissue in the mouth or lip area, and the tissue that is available does not join together properly. A cleft lip is a physical split or separation of the two sides of the upper lip and appears as a narrow opening or gap in the skin of the upper lip. This separation often extends beyond the base of the nose and includes the bones of the upper jaw and/or upper gum. A cleft palate can involve the hard palate (the bony front portion of the roof of the mouth), and/or the soft palate (the soft back portion of the roof of the mouth). Because the lip and the palate develop separately, it is possible to have a cleft lip without a cleft palate, a cleft palate without a cleft lip, or both together. Cleft lip, with or without cleft palate, affects one in 700 babies annually, and is the fourth most common birth defect in the U.S. Clefts occur more often in children of Asian, Latino, or Native American descent. Compared with girls, twice as many boys have a cleft lip, both with and without a cleft palate. In most cases, the cause of cleft lip and cleft palate is unknown. There appears to be a greater chance of clefting in a newborn if a sibling, parent, or relative has had the problem. Cleft lip and cleft palate may also occur as a result of exposure to viruses or chemicals while the fetus is developing in the womb. If the clefting has not been detected in an ultrasound prior to the baby's birth, a physical exam of the mouth, nose, and palate confirms the presence of cleft lip or cleft palate after a child's birth. Children with a cleft palate may need to wear a man-made palate to help them eat properly and ensure that they are receiving adequate nutrition until surgical treatment is provided. Children with cleft palate are at increased risk of ear infections since they are more prone to fluid build-up in the middle ear. To prevent this from happening, children with cleft palate usually need special tubes placed in the eardrums to aid fluid drainage, and their hearing needs to be checked once a year. Children with cleft lip or cleft palate may also have trouble speaking. These children's voices don't carry well, the voice may take on a nasal sound, and the speech may be difficult to understand. For others, a special doctor, called speech pathologist, will work with the child to resolve speech difficulties. Children with clefts are more prone to a larger than average number of cavities and often have missing, extra, malformed, or displaced teeth requiring dental and orthodontic treatments. A defect in the alveolus can (1) displace, tip, or rotate permanent teeth, (2) prevent permanent teeth from appearing, and (3) prevent the alveolar ridge from forming. Due to the number of oral health and medical problems associated with a cleft lip or cleft palate, a team of doctors and other specialists is usually involved in the care of these children. Members of a cleft lip and palate team typically include: Plastic surgeon to evaluate and perform necessary surgeries on the lip and/or palate An otolaryngologist (an ear, nose, and throat doctor) to evaluate hearing problems and consider treatment options for hearing problems An oral surgeon to reposition segments of the upper jaw when needed, to improve function and appearance and to repair the cleft of the gum An orthodontist to straighten and reposition teeth A dentist to perform routine dental care A prosthodontist to make artificial teeth and dental appliances to improve the appearance and to meet functional requirements for eating and speaking A speech pathologist to assess speech and feeding problems A speech therapist to work with the child to improve speech An audiologist (a specialist in communication disorders stemming from a hearing impairment); to assess and monitor hearing A nurse coordinator to provide ongoing supervision of the child's health A social worker/psychologist to support the family and assess any adjustment problems A geneticist to help parents and adult patients understand the chances of having more children with these conditions The health care team works together to develop a plan of care to meet the individual needs of each patient. A cleft lip may require one or two surgeries depending on the extent of the repair needed. Repair of a cleft palate often requires multiple surgeries over the course of 18 years. The initial surgery creates a functional palate, reduces the chances that fluid will develop in the middle ears, and aids in the proper development of the teeth and facial bones. Children with a cleft palate may also need a bone graft when they are about 8 years old to fill in the upper gum line so that it can support permanent teeth and stabilize the upper jaw. About 20% of children with a cleft palate require further surgeries to help improve their speech. Once the permanent teeth grow in, braces are often needed to straighten the teeth. Additional surgeries may be performed to improve the appearance of the lip and nose, close openings between the mouth and nose, help breathing, and stabilize and realign the jaw. Final repairs of the scars left by the initial surgery will probably not be performed until adolescence, when the facial structure is more fully developed. Although treatment for a cleft lip and/or cleft palate may extend over several years and require several surgeries depending upon the involvement, most children affected by this condition can achieve normal appearance, speech, and eating. Generally, the preventive and restorative dental care needs of children with clefts are the same as for other children. However, children with cleft lip and cleft palate may have special problems related to missing, malformed, or malpositioned teeth that require close monitoring. Like other children, children born with cleft lip and cleft palate require proper cleaning, good nutrition, and fluoride treatment in order to have healthy teeth. If a soft children's toothbrush will not adequately clean the teeth because of the modified shape of the mouth and teeth, a toothette may be recommended by your dentist. After teeth erupt, an orthodontist can further assess a child's short and long-term dental needs. He or she may make a dental bridge to replace missing teeth or make special appliances called \"speech bulbs\" or \"palatal lifts\" to help close the nose from the mouth so that speech sounds more normal. The prosthodontist coordinates treatment with the oral or plastic surgeon and with the speech pathologist."], [1586, "Cleaning and Bandaging a Wound", "Skin wounds, including animal or human bites, need thorough cleaning to reduce the risk of infection and scarring and to promote healing. You'll have to stop any bleeding, clean the wound, and perhaps bandage the wound. Put on medical gloves, if available, before applying direct pressure to the wound. If gloves aren't available, put something else between your hands and the wound. You can use many layers of clean cloth, plastic bags, or the cleanest material available. Hold direct pressure on the wound, if possible, and elevate the injured area. Do all you can to keep the wound clean and avoid further injury to the area. Let the injured person clean his or her own wound, if possible. Put on medical gloves before cleaning the wound, if available. Remove large pieces of dirt or other debris from the wound with cleaned tweezers. Wash the wound under running tap water (the more the better) to remove all the dirt, debris, and bacteria from the wound. Hard scrubbing may actually cause more damage to the tissue and increase the chance of infection. Scrubbing the wound will probably hurt and may increase bleeding, but it is necessary to clean the wound thoroughly. If you have a water sprayer in your kitchen sink, try using the sprayer to wash the wound. Large, minor, dirty wounds may be easier to clean in the shower.If some dirt or other debris remains in the wound, repeat the cleaning. Hard scrubbing may actually cause more damage to the tissue and increase the chance of infection. Scrubbing the wound will probably hurt and may increase bleeding, but it is necessary to clean the wound thoroughly. If you have a water sprayer in your kitchen sink, try using the sprayer to wash the wound. This usually removes most of the dirt and other objects from the wound. Large, minor, dirty wounds may be easier to clean in the shower. If some dirt or other debris remains in the wound, repeat the cleaning. Consider bandaging the wound if you need to protect it from getting dirty or irritated. Before you buy or use one, be sure to read the label carefully and follow the label's instructions when you apply the bandage. You may cover the wound with a thin layer of petroleum jelly, such as Vaseline, and a nonstick bandage. If needed, use an adhesive strip called a butterfly bandage to hold the edges of the wound together. If an infection develops under a bandage, you may need to see your doctor. You may need to see a doctor for a large, deep, or very dirty wound. You may also need to see a doctor if the wound is too painful to clean or you cannot remove dirt, debris, or a foreign object. Most wounds that need stitches should be treated within 6 to 8 hours after the injury to reduce the risk of infection. Very dirty wounds may not be stitched to avoid the risk of infection. If you are going to see a doctor immediately, the wound can be cleaned and treated at the medical facility. A quick test to determine whether you need stitches is to stop the bleeding, wash the wound well, and then pinch the sides of the wound together. If the edges of the wound come together and it looks better, you may want to consider getting stitches. Most cuts that require treatment should be stitched, stapled, or closed with skin adhesives within 6 to 8 hours after the injury. Your risk of infection increases the longer the cut remains open. A cut from a clean object, such as a clean kitchen knife, may be stitched from 12 to 24 hours after the injury depending on the location of the cut. A facial wound may be treated to reduce scarring."], [1587, "Chronic Myeloid Leukemia", "Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a cancer that affects your blood cells and bone marrow -- the soft part inside your bones where blood cells are made. You may also hear your doctor call it chronic myeloid leukemia. With treatment, you may go into what's called \"remission.\" You can be in remission for many years. CML usually happens when you're middle-aged or older. The symptoms tend to come on gradually. Many of them can also be signs of other illnesses. For instance, you might feel tired, lose weight when you're not trying to, or sometimes get a fever. The disease starts with a problem in the genes of your blood cells. Sections of two different chromosomes switch places and make a new abnormal one. They're called leukemia cells, and when they show up in your bloodstream, there's less room for healthy blood cells. You don't typically get it from your parents or from infections. Your smoking habits and diet don't seem to raise your chance of getting it either. CML has three phases: chronic, accelerated, and blastic. You're more likely to get some of these symptoms: Feel very tired Have a fever Get bruises Have night sweats Be short of breath Lose some weight Feel less hungry Get swelling or pain on your left side (which could be a sign of an enlarged spleen) Feel pain in your bones Other symptoms may include stroke, changes in your vision, ringing in your ears, you feel like you're in a daze, and you get prolonged erections. In this stage, you'll have more severe symptoms, including: Infections Bleeding Skin changes including bumps, tumors Swollen glands Bone pain If you have symptoms, your doctor will want to know: What problems have you noticed? Your doctor may do more tests to confirm the diagnosis, such as: Complete blood count. It's a blood test that checks to see how many white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets you have. Your doctor uses a needle to take a sample, usually from your hip bone. FISH test (fluorescence in situ hybridization). A CT is an X-ray that takes a series of pictures inside your body. It's a lab test that looks for the BCR-ABL gene, which is involved in the process that tells your body to make too many of the wrong kind of white blood cells. The goal of your treatment is to destroy the leukemia blood cells in your body and restore healthy ones to a normal level. It's usually not possible to get rid of all the bad cells. If you get treatment during the early, chronic phase of CML, it can help prevent the disease from moving to a more serious level. Some TKIs that are commonly used include: Dasatinib (Sprycel) Imatinib (Gleevec) Nilotinib (Tasigna) You may get bosutinib (Bosulif) and ponatinib (Iclusig) if other drugs don't help or make you too sick. If your disease continues to get worse after you've used two or more TKIs, your doctor may suggest a drug called omacetaxine mepesuccinate (Synribo). Other CML treatment options include chemotherapy and biologic therapy, which uses a medication called interferon to help stir up action in your immune system -- your body's defense against germs. Stem cells are in the news a lot, but usually when you hear about them they're referring to \"embryo\" stem cells that are used in cloning. These are cells that live in your bone marrow and help make new blood cells. When you get a stem cell transplant, a donor will supply the new stem cells. You'll need to get on a waiting list to find a donor who is the right match you so that your body doesn't \"reject\" them. Close relatives, such as your brother or sister, are the best chances for a good match. If that doesn't work out, you need to get on a list of potential donors from strangers. Sometimes the best odds for the right stem cells for you will be from someone who is in the same racial or ethnic group as you. Follow your doctor's treatment plan, eat healthy, and exercise when you feel up to it. Although it's hard to get rid of completely, many people live long lives with it. Once you're diagnosed, you should see a hematologist-oncologist, a doctor with special training in blood diseases, especially cancer. Always feel free to get a second opinion from another doctor if you feel you want one. Make sure you reach out to your family and friends for the emotional backing you need. They can be a huge help as you manage your disease. It also helps to talk to others who have CML.

People who get medical care live longer today, because doctors are diagnosing CLL earlier. It's natural to have worries and questions about any serious condition. Tell your friends and family about any concerns you have. And talk to your doctor about how to join a support group. You're more likely to get it if: You have a parent, sibling, or child who has CLL. You have relatives who are either Eastern European or Russian Jews. If you were exposed to Agent Orange, an herbicide widely used during the Vietnam War, your chances of getting CLL may also be higher.

If you need treatment, you will get a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy: Aspiration: Your doctor inserts a thin, hollow needle into the bone (usually, your hip) to take out a small amount of liquid marrow. Biopsy: Your doctor uses a slightly larger needle to remove a small amount of bone, marrow, and blood. By checking the samples under a microscope for abnormal cells, your doctor can tell how much CLL is in your body and how fast it's moving. If you have early stage CLL, you probably don't need treatment. Your doctor will closely check to make sure your condition hasn't changed. You may start treatment if your doctor notices a change, like the number of lymphocytes in your blood growing quickly, a decline in the number of your red blood cells, or swelling in a lymph node gets bigger. Your treatment may include: Chemotherapy. You may get this by pill, shot, or IV. Doctors often combine two or more drugs that work in different ways to kill the cancer cells. You probably won't need it, unless your doctor recommends it to shrink swelling in a lymph node, in your spleen, or in another organ that's causing pain.

Close relatives, such as your brother or sister, are the best chance for a good match. If that doesn't work out, you need to get on a list of potential donors from strangers. Sometimes the best chance for the right stem cells for you will be from someone who has the same racial or ethnic background as you. Before the transplant, you'll likely need to get treated with high doses of chemo for about a week or two. This can be a tough process, because you may get side effects like nausea and mouth sores. When the high-dose chemo is done, you'll start the transplant. You won't feel any pain from this, and you'll be awake while it's happening. After your transplant, it could take 2 to 6 weeks for the stem cells to multiply and start making new blood cells.

Traditional Chinese medicine focuses on maintaining the yin-yang balance to maintain health and prevent illness. Traditional Chinese medicine doctors look at the balance of body, mind, and spirit to determine how to restore qi, the yin-yang balance, and good health. People use traditional Chinese medicine to treat many illnesses from asthma and allergies to cancer and infertility. Traditional Chinese medicine therapies include: Acupuncture, which uses thin metal needles placed along the body's meridians. Acupressure, which uses the hands or fingers to apply direct pressure to points along the body's meridians. Chinese herbs, combinations of herbs, roots, powders, or animal substances to help restore balance in the body. Cupping, which uses warm air in glass jars to create suction placed on areas of the body to help stimulate qi. Moxibustion, which uses small amounts of heated plant fiber (moxa, or Chinese mugwort) on specific areas of the body. Research in China and worldwide has shown traditional Chinese medicine to be helpful for many types of illness. In traditional Chinese medicine, each person might receive a different treatment for the same illness depending on the person's own qi and yin-yang balance. The National Institutes of Health, through the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health and other institutes, funds ongoing research of many complementary therapies to determine their benefits and risks. Acupuncture has been the most studied traditional Chinese medicine treatment and has become accepted as a therapy for certain conditions in the United States. Promising results have been found for the use of acupuncture in treating nausea and vomiting related to chemotherapy, postsurgery pain, and pregnancy. Acupuncture also may be useful for other conditions such as addiction, stroke rehabilitation, headache, menstrual cramps, tennis elbow, low back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and asthma.

Also, the eating habits your children pick up when they are young will help them maintain a healthy lifestyle when they are adults. Your child's health care provider can evaluate your child's weight and growth and let you know if your child needs to lose or gain weight or if any dietary changes need to be made. Some of the most important aspects of healthy eating are portion control and cutting down on how much fat and sugar your child eats or drinks. Simple ways to reduce fat intake in your child's diet and promote a healthy weight include serving: Low-fat or nonfat dairy products Poultry without skin Lean cuts of meats Whole grain breads and cereals Healthy snacks such as fruit and veggies Also, reduce the amount of sugar sweetened drinks and salt in your child's diet. If you are unsure about how to select and prepare a variety of foods for your family, consult a registered dietitian for nutrition counseling. It is important that you do not place your overweight child(ren) on a restrictive diet. Children should never be placed on a restrictive diet to lose weight unless a doctor supervises one for medical reasons. Other approaches parents can take to develop healthy eating habits in their children include: Guide your family's choices rather than dictate foods. Make a wide variety of healthful foods available in the house. Before offering a second helping or serving, ask your child to wait at least 15 minutes to see if they are truly still hungry. Try to make mealtimes pleasant with conversation and sharing, not a time for scolding or arguing. If mealtimes are unpleasant, children may try to eat faster to leave the table as soon as possible. These activities will give you hints about your children's food preferences, an opportunity to teach your children about nutrition, and provide your kids with a feeling of accomplishment. Continuous snacking may lead to overeating, but snacks that are planned at specific times during the day can be part of a nutritious diet, without spoiling a child's appetite at meal times. You should make snacks as nutritious as possible, without depriving your children of occasional chips or cookies, especially at parties or other social events. Try to eat only in designated areas of your home, such as the dining room or kitchen. Eating in front of the TV may make it difficult to pay attention to feelings of fullness, and may lead to overeating. Over consumption of sweetened drinks and sodas has been linked to increased rates of obesity in children. Similarly, when foods, such as sweets, are used as a reward, children may assume that these foods are better or more valuable than other foods.

DMD is characterized by weakness and wasting (atrophy) of the muscles of the pelvic area followed by the involvement of the shoulder muscles. The disease is progressive and most affected individuals require a wheelchair by the teenage years. Serious life-threatening complications may ultimately develop including disease of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) and breathing (respiratory) difficulties. DMD is caused by changes (mutations) of the DMD gene on the X chromosome. The gene regulates the production of a protein called dystrophin that is found in association with the inner side of the membrane of skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. Dystrophin is thought to play an important role in maintaining the structure of these muscle cells.

Although some children may continue to function reasonably well in structured environments, most kids with significant depression will suffer a noticeable change in social activities, loss of interest in school and poor academic performance, or a change in appearance. Although relatively rare in youths under 12, young children do attempt suicide -- and may do so impulsively when they are upset or angry. Children with a family history of violence, alcohol abuse, or physical or sexual abuse are at greater risk for suicide, as are those with depressive symptoms. As in adults, depression in children can be caused by any combination of factors that relate to physical health, life events, family history, environment, genetic vulnerability and biochemical disturbance. Children who have parents that suffer from depression tend to develop their first episode of depression earlier than children whose parents do not. Children from chaotic or conflicted families, or children and teens who abuse substances like alcohol and drugs, are also at greater risk of depression. If the symptoms of depression in your child have lasted for at least two weeks, you should schedule a visit with his or her doctor to make sure there are no physical reasons for the symptoms and to make sure that your child receives proper treatment. A mental health evaluation should include interviews with you (the parent or primary caregiver) and your child, and any additional psychological testing that is necessary. Information from teachers, friends and classmates can be useful for showing that these symptoms are consistent during your child's various activities and are a marked change from previous behavior. There are no specific tests -- medical or psychological -- that can clearly show depression, but tools such as questionnaires (for both the child and parents) combined with personal information can be very useful in helping diagnose depression in children. Sometimes those therapy sessions and questionnaires can uncover other concerns that contribute to the depression such as ADHD, conduct disorder, and OCD. Treatment options for children with depression are similar to those for adults, including psychotherapy (counseling) and medication. The role that family and the child's environment play in the treatment process is different from that of adults. The best studies to date indicate that a combination of psychotherapy and medication is most effective at treating depression. Studies show that the antidepressant Prozac is effective in treating depression in children and teens. The drug is officially recognized by the FDA for treatment of children ages 8 to 18 with depression. Antidepressants need to be used with caution as they can trigger bouts of manic or hyperactive behavior in children with bipolar disorder. The FDA warns that antidepressant medications may increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children and adolescents with depression and other psychiatric disorders. Additionally, if your child is placed on these medications, it is still very important to continue to follow closely with the physician and therapist. Studies have found that first-time depression in children is occurring at younger ages than previously. And because studies have shown that depression may precede more serious mental illness later in life, diagnosis, early treatment and close monitoring are crucial. It is very important for you -- as the parent -- to understand depression and realize the importance of treatment so that your child may continue to grow physically and emotionally in a healthy way. Warning signs of suicidal behavior in children include: Many depressive symptoms (changes in eating, sleeping, activities) Social isolation, including isolation from the family Talk of suicide, hopelessness, or helplessness Increased acting-out of undesirable behaviors (sexual/behavioral) Increased risk-taking behaviors Frequent accidents Substance abuse Focus on morbid and negative themes Talk about death and dying Increased crying or reduced emotional expression Giving away possessions"], [1611, "Childbirth", "Pregnancy labor happens in three stages and lasts on average 12 to 24 hours for a first birth. The first stage is the longest part of labor and can last up to 20 hours. It begins when your cervix starts to open (dilate) and ends when it is completely open (fully dilated) at 10 centimeters. When the cervix dilates from 0 to 3 or 4 centimeters, contractions get stronger as time progresses. Mild contractions begin at 15 to 20 minutes apart and last 60 to 90 seconds. The contractions become more regular until they are less than 5 minutes apart. This part of labor (called the Latent Phase) is best experienced in the comfort of your home. When the cervix dilates from 4 to 8 centimeters (called the Active Phase), contractions get stronger and are about 3 minutes apart, lasting about 45 seconds. You may have a backache and increased bleeding from your vagina (called the \"bloody show\"). Tips to help you through the Active Phase of labor: Try changing your position. You may want to try getting on your hands and knees to ease the discomfort of back labor. If your amniotic membrane ruptures -- or your \"water breaks\" -- the contractions may get much stronger. When the cervix dilates from 8 to 10 centimeters (called the Transition Phase), contractions are 2 to 3 minutes apart and last about 1 minute. It is during the active phase of labor that you will go to the hospital or birthing center. A monitor will be placed on your abdomen for a short time, or continuously, to check for uterine contractions and assess the baby's heart rate. An intravenous (IV) line may be placed into a vein in your arm to deliver fluids and medications if necessary. The second stage of labor begins when your cervix is fully dilated at 10 centimeters. This stage continues until your baby passes through the birth canal, vagina, and is born. Contractions may feel different from the first stage of labor -- they will slow to 2 to 5 minutes apart and last from about 60 to 90 seconds. Try to rest as much as possible between intervals of pushing, and only push when the health care provider tells you. The location of your baby's head as it moves through the pelvis (called descent) is reported in a number called a station. If the baby's head has not started its descent, the station is described at minus 3 (-3). When your baby's head is at the zero station, it is at the middle of the birth canal and is engaged in the pelvis. When your baby is born, your health care provider will hold the baby with his or her head lowered to prevent amniotic fluid, mucus, and blood from getting into the baby's lungs. Your health care provider will place the baby on your stomach and shortly after, the umbilical cord will be cut. The third stage of labor begins after the baby is born and ends when the placenta separates from the wall of the uterus and is passed through the vagina. This stage is often called delivery of the \"afterbirth\" and is the shortest stage of labor."], [1612, "Child Care", "Start by asking friends, co-workers, and family members to recommend a sitter or child care center they trust. Ask a lot of questions, like: How many years of experience do you have/How many years have you been in business?Do you/your staff know CPR?What kinds of activities do you do with the children? How many years of experience do you have/How many years have you been in business? If something doesn't feel right about the sitter or day care center, don't leave your child with them. Start your own family sing a-long, sharing fun songs like \"The Wheels on the Bus\" or the \"Hokey Pokey.\" You don't need to sing in tune, you just need to sing! Before you leave your toddler alone with a new sitter, go over your house rules, your child's routine, and what to do in case of an emergency. If you're evaluating a childcare center, watch how the staff interacts with the children. The staff-to-child ratio should be one staff person for every three to five young children. When your child pushes the plate away, it means she's full. If the grandparents don't live close enough to visit often, use the phone and Internet to keep your kids in touch. No matter how much your toddler screams or gets under your skin, don't spank."], [1613, "CHIK", "It is characterized by a rash, fever, and severe joint pain (arthralgias) that usually lasts for three to seven days. Because of its effect on the joints, Chikungunya has been classified among the Arthritic Viruses."], [1614, "Chickenpox (Varicella)", "Chickenpox is a very contagious infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. The telltale sign of chickenpox is a super-itchy skin rash with red blisters. Symptoms appear within 10 to 21 days after you've been in contact with someone who has the virus. Chickenpox is generally mild, especially in children. Children under the age of 2 are most at risk for chickenpox. You're more at risk for chickenpox if you: Haven't had the virus before Haven't been vaccinated for it Work in a school or child care facility Live with children Very easily. You can get the virus by breathing in particles that come from chickenpox blisters or by touching something on which the particles landed. The best way to prevent the spread of the virus is to get the varicella vaccine. Children who've never had chickenpox should get two doses of the vaccine -- the first at 12 to 15 months of age, and the second at 4 to s6 years. People over age 13 who've never been vaccinated should get two doses of the vaccine at least 28 days apart. Adults have a higher risk for developing complications from chickenpox than children. Those with weakened immune systems due to cancer, HIV, or another condition are also at risk. Once you've had chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus stays in your nerve cells for years."], [1615, "CHH", "McKusick type metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, also known as cartilage-hair hypoplasia, is a rare progressive inherited disorder characterized by unusually fine, sparse hair and short stature with abnormally short arms and legs (short-limbed dwarfism). Portions of the long bones of the arms and legs develop abnormally with unusual cartilage formations and subsequent abnormal bone formation at the large (bulbous) end portions (metaphyses) of these long bones (metaphyseal chondrodysplasia). In addition, most individuals with McKusick type metaphyseal chondrodysplasia may exhibit impairment of specialized cells (T-cells) that play an important role in helping the body's immune system to fight infection (cellular immunodeficiency). In some cases, affected infants may also exhibit improper intestinal absorption of certain necessary nutrients (malabsorption) and/or dental abnormalities such as unusually small teeth (microdontia)."], [1616, "CHF (Congestive Heart Failure)", "With heart failure, blood moves through the heart and body at a slower rate, and pressure in the heart increases. As a result, the heart cannot pump enough oxygen and nutrients to meet the body's needs. The chambers of the heart may respond by stretching to hold more blood to pump through the body or by becoming stiff and thickened. This helps to keep the blood moving, but the heart muscle walls may eventually weaken and become unable to pump as efficiently. As a result, the kidneys may respond by causing the body to retain fluid (water) and salt. If fluid builds up in the arms, legs, ankles, feet, lungs, or other organs, the body becomes congested, and congestive heart failure is the term used to describe the condition. Heart failure is caused by many conditions that damage the heart muscle, including: Coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease (CAD), a disease of the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart, causes decreased blood flow to the heart muscle. If the arteries become blocked or severely narrowed, the heart becomes starved for oxygen and nutrients. A heart attack occurs when a coronary artery becomes suddenly blocked, stopping the flow of blood to the heart muscle. A heart attack damages the heart muscle, resulting in a scarred area that does not function properly. Damage to the heart muscle from causes other than artery or blood flow problems, such as from infections or alcohol or drug abuse. Conditions including high blood pressure, valve disease, thyroid disease, kidney disease, diabetes, or heart defects present at birth can all cause heart failure. In addition, heart failure can occur when several diseases or conditions are present at once. You may not have any symptoms of heart failure, or the symptoms may be mild to severe. Fluid backup in the lungs can cause shortness of breath with exercise or difficulty breathing at rest or when lying flat in bed. Less blood to your kidneys causes fluid and water retention, resulting in swollen ankles, legs, abdomen (called edema), and weight gain. If you have heart failure, you may have one or all of these symptoms or you may have none of them. Systolic dysfunction (or systolic heart failure) occurs when the heart muscle doesn't contract with enough force, so there is less oxygen-rich blood that is pumped throughout the body. Diastolic dysfunction (or diastolic heart failure) occurs when the heart contracts normally, but the ventricles do not relax properly or are stiff, and less blood enters the heart during normal filling. A calculation done during an echocardiogram, called the ejection fraction (EF), is used to measure how well your heart pumps with each beat to help determine if systolic or diastolic dysfunction is present. You will be asked about any conditions you have that may cause heart failure (such as coronary artery disease, angina, diabetes, heart valve disease, and high blood pressure). You will be asked if you smoke, take drugs, drink alcohol (and how much you drink), and about what drugs you take. Your doctor will listen to your heart and look for signs of heart failure as well as other illnesses that may have caused your heart muscle to weaken or stiffen. Your doctor may also order other tests to determine the cause and severity of your heart failure. Blood tests are used to evaluate kidney and thyroid function as well as to check cholesterol levels and the presence of anemia. Anemia is a blood condition that occurs when there is not enough hemoglobin (the substance in red blood cells that enables the blood to transport oxygen through the body) in a person's blood. BNP is a substance secreted from the heart in response to changes in blood pressure that occur when heart failure develops or worsens. BNP blood levels increase when heart failure symptoms worsen, and decrease when the heart failure condition is stable. A chest X-ray shows the size of your heart and whether there is fluid build-up around the heart and lungs. The Ejection Fraction (EF) is used to measure how well your heart pumps with each beat to determine if systolic dysfunction or heart failure with preserved left ventricular function is present. This invasive procedure helps determine whether coronary artery disease is a cause of congestive heart failure. Other tests may be ordered, depending on your condition. There are more treatment options available for heart failure than ever before. Tight control over your medications and lifestyle, coupled with careful monitoring, are the first steps. As the condition progresses, doctors specializing in the treatment of heart failure can offer more advanced treatment options. The goals of treating heart failure are primarily to decrease the likelihood of disease progression (thereby decreasing the risk of death and the need for hospitalization), to lessen symptoms, and to improve quality of life. Together, you and your doctor can determine the best course of treatment for you. In 2001, the American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC) described the \"Stages of Heart Failure.\" These stages, which were updated in 2005, will help you understand that heart failure is often a progressive condition and can worsen over time. They will also help you understand why a new medication was added to your treatment plan and may help you understand why lifestyle changes and other treatments are needed. The stages classified by the AHA and ACC are different than the New York Heart Association (NYHA) clinical classifications of heart failure that rank patients as class I-II-III-IV, according to the degree of symptoms or functional limits. Ask your doctor what stage of heart failure you are in. Check the table below to see if your therapy matches what the AHA and ACC recommend. The table below outlines a basic plan of care that may or may not apply to you, based on the cause of your heart failure and your special needs. Ask your doctor to explain therapies that are listed if you do not understand why you are or are not receiving them. High blood pressure Diabetes Coronary artery disease Metabolic syndrome History of cardiotoxic drug therapy History of alcohol abuse History of rheumatic fever Family history of cardiomyopathy Quit smoking. An angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) is prescribed if you have coronary artery disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or other vascular or cardiac conditions. Beta blockers may be prescribed if you have high blood pressure or if you've had a previous heart attack. Prior heart attack Valve disease Cardiomyopathy Treatment methods above for Stage A apply All patients should take an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitors) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) Beta-blockers should be prescribed for patients after a heart attack Surgery options for coronary artery repair and valve repair or replacement (as appropriate) should be discussed Shortness of breath Fatigue Reduced ability to exercise Treatment methods above for Stage A apply All patients should take an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitors) and beta-blockers African-American patients may be prescribed a hydralazine/nitrate combination if symptoms persist Diuretics (water pills) and digoxin may be prescribed if symptoms persist An aldosterone inhibitor may be prescribed when symptoms remain severe with other therapies Restrict dietary sodium (salt) Monitor weight Restrict fluids (as appropriate) Drugs that worsen the condition should be discontinued As appropriate, cardiac resynchronization therapy (biventricular pacemaker) may be recommended An implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) may be recommended Treatment methods for Stages A, B &amp; C apply Patient should be evaluated to determine if the following treatments are available options: heart transplant, ventricular assist devices, surgery options, research therapies, continuous infusion of intravenous inotropic drugs and end-of-life (palliative or hospice) care Keep your blood pressure low. In heart failure, the release of hormones causes the blood vessels to constrict or tighten. It is important to keep your blood pressure controlled so that your heart can pump more effectively without extra stress. Call your doctor if you have unexplained weight gain (3 pounds in one day or 5 pounds in one week) or if you have increased swelling. Your doctor may ask you to keep a record of the amount of fluids you drink or eat and how often you go to the bathroom. Remember, the more fluid you carry in your blood vessels, the harder your heart must work to pump excess fluid through your body. Limiting your fluid intake to less than 2 liters per day will help decrease the workload of your heart and prevent symptoms from recurring. If you follow a low-sodium diet, you should have less fluid retention, less swelling, and breathe easier. Dry weight is your weight without extra water (fluid). Call your doctor if new symptoms occur or if your symptoms worsen. Do not wait for your symptoms to become so severe that you need to seek emergency treatment. Medications are used to improve your heart's ability to pump blood, decrease stress on your heart, decrease the progression of heart failure, and prevent fluid retention. Many heart failure drugs are used to decrease the release of harmful hormones. These drugs will cause your blood vessels to dilate or relax (thereby lowering your blood pressure). During follow-up visits, your doctors will make sure you are staying healthy and that your heart failure is not getting worse. Notify all your doctors about your heart failure, medications, and any restrictions. Have surgery or other procedures to treat your heart failure as recommended. There are several different types of medications that are best avoided in those with heart failure including: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as Motrin or Aleve. For relief of aches, pains, or fever take Tylenol instead. Some antiarrhythmic agents Most calcium channel blockers (if you have systolic heart failure) Some nutritional supplements, such as salt substitutes, and growth hormone therapies Antacids that contain sodium (salt) Decongestants such as Sudafed If you are taking any of these drugs, discuss them with your doctor. It is important to know the names of your medications, what they are used for, and how often and at what times you take them. Keep a list of your medications and bring them with you to each of your doctor visits. Even if you have no symptoms, your medications decrease the work of your heart so that it can pump more effectively. There are several things you can do to improve your quality of life if you have heart failure. Limit your consumption of sodium (salt) to less than 2,000 milligrams (2 grams) each day. Reduce total daily intake of calories to lose weight if necessary. A regular cardiovascular exercise program, prescribed by your doctor, will help improve your strength and make you feel better. Certain activities, such as pushing or pulling heavy objects and shoveling may worsen heart failure and its symptoms. In heart failure, surgery may sometimes prevent further damage to the heart and improve the heart's function. The most common surgery for heart failure caused by coronary artery disease is bypass surgery. Although surgery is more risky for people with heart failure, new strategies before, during, and after surgery have reduced the risks and improved outcomes. Diseased heart valves can be treated both surgically (traditional heart valve surgery) and non-surgically (balloon valvuloplasty). Implantable left ventricular assist device (LVAD). The LVAD is known as the \"bridge to transplantation\" for patients who haven't responded to other treatments and are hospitalized with severe systolic heart failure. It allows you to be mobile, sometimes returning home to await a heart transplant. It may also be used as destination therapy for long-term support in patients who are not eligible for transplant. A heart transplant is considered when heart failure is so severe that it does not respond to all other therapies, but the person's health is otherwise good. Heart failure management is a team effort, and you are the key player on the team. Your heart doctor will prescribe your medications and manage other medical problems. But it is up to YOU to take your medications, make dietary changes, live a healthy lifestyle, keep your follow-up appointments, and be an active member of the team. With the right care, heart failure may not stop you from doing the things you enjoy. Your prognosis or outlook for the future will depend on how well your heart muscle is functioning, your symptoms, and how well you respond to and follow your treatment plan. Everyone with a long-term illness, such as heart failure, should discuss their desires for extended medical care with their doctor and family. A living will expresses your desires about the use of medical treatments to prolong your life."], [1617, "Chelation Therapy", "Chelation therapy is a chemical process in which a synthetic solution-EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid)-is injected into the bloodstream to remove heavy metals and/or minerals from the body. When EDTA is injected into the veins, it \"grabs\" heavy metals and minerals such as lead, mercury, copper, iron, arsenic, aluminum, and calcium and removes them from the body. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved prescription chelation therapy for the treatment of lead poisoning. Injected EDTA binds with the harmful metal and both are then eliminated from the body through the kidneys. Some health professionals have also used chelation therapy to treat atherosclerosis and/or coronary artery disease, although there is not enough scientific evidence to prove that this treatment is effective. Some people believe that EDTA binds with calcium deposits (the part of plaque that obstructs the flow of blood to the heart) in the arteries, and then EDTA \"cleans out\" the calcium deposits from the arteries, reducing the risk of heart problems. Some health professionals also suspect that EDTA may act as an antioxidant by removing metals that combine with LDL cholesterol, which can damage arteries. The theory is that when you remove metals that flow freely through arteries (such as copper or calcium), you may slow down diseases such as atherosclerosis. Some experts believe that EDTA could remove calcium from healthy bones, muscles, and other tissues, as well as from diseased arteries. Many people report less pain from chronic inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, lupus, and scleroderma after chelation therapy. The theory is that EDTA acts as an antioxidant, which protects the body from inflammation and protects blood vessels. EDTA may remove vital minerals from the body along with the toxic metals. Vitamins and minerals are added to the EDTA solution to help keep them at an optimal level in the body to maintain health."], [1618, "CHARGE Association", "The term CHARGE comes from the first letter of some of the more common features seen in these children: (C) = coloboma (usually retinochoroidal) and cranial nerve defects (80-90%)(H) = heart defects in 75-85%, especially tetralogy of Fallot(A) = atresia of the choanae (blocked nasal breathing passages) (50-60%)(R) = retardation of growth (70-80%) and development (G) = genital underdevelopment due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (E) = ear abnormalities and sensorineural hearing loss (&amp;#62;90%) Diagnosis is based on a specific set of features (see below).

Most HPV infections don't cause any symptoms, and go away on their own. Every year in the U.S. about 10,000 women get cervical cancer and 3,700 die from it. HPV is also associated with several less common types of cancer in both men and women. It can also cause genital warts and warts in the upper respiratory tract. More than 50% of sexually active men and women are infected with HPV at sometime in their lives. HPV vaccine is an inactivated (not live) vaccine which protects against four major types of HPV. HPV vaccine can prevent most genital warts and most cases of cervical cancer. But vaccinated women still need cervical cancer screening because the vaccine does not protect against all HPV types that cause cervical cancer. Routine Vaccination HPV vaccine is routinely recommended for girls 11 and 12 years of age. Doctors may give it to girls as young as 9 years The HPV4 vaccine (the type recommended for prevention of genital warts in girls) may also be given in three doses to boys aged 9 to 26. It is important for girls to get HPV vaccine before their first sexual contact -- because they have not been exposed to HPV. For these girls, the vaccine can prevent almost 100% of disease caused by the four types of HPV targeted by the vaccine. However, if a girl or woman is already infected with a type of HPV, the vaccine will not prevent disease from that type. Catch-Up Vaccination The vaccine is also recommended for girls and women 13 through 26 years of age who did not receive it when they were younger. HPV vaccine is given as a 3-dose series: 1st Dose: Now 2nd Dose: 2 months after Dose 1 3rd Dose: 6 months after Dose 1 Additional (booster) doses are not recommended. HPV vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Some girls or women should not get HPV vaccine or should wait. Anyone who has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to yeast, to any other component of HPV vaccine, or to a previous dose of HPV vaccine should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if the person getting the vaccine has any severe allergies. Pregnant women should not get the vaccine. Receiving HPV vaccine when pregnant is not a reason to consider terminating the pregnancy. Women who are breast feeding may safely get the vaccine. Any woman who learns that she was pregnant when she got HPV vaccine is encouraged to call the HPV vaccine in pregnancy registry at 800-986-8999. People who are mildly ill when the shot is scheduled can still get HPV vaccine. People with moderate or severe illnesses should wait until they recover. HPV vaccine does not appear to cause any serious side effects. Several mild problems may occur with HPV vaccine: Pain at the injection site (about eight people in 10) Redness or swelling at the injection site (about one person in four) Mild fever (100 F) (about one person in 10) Itching at the injection site (about one person in 30) Moderate fever (102 F) (about one person in 65) These symptoms do not last long and go away on their own. If they do occur, it would be within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. Like all vaccines, HPV vaccine will continue to be monitored for unusual or severe problems.

This invastive bacteria is one of the leading causes of bacterial meningitis in children aged 2 to 18 in the U.S. Meningococcal disease can include meningitis -- a serious, potentially life-threatening inflammation of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord -- and/or a life-threatening blood infection. Meningococcal disease can cause limb loss through amputation, hearing loss, problems with the nervous system, mental retardation, seizures, and strokes. Fortunately, meningococcal disease is preventable, and the key to prevention is the meningococcal vaccine. Here is information about the vaccine that you can use to help protect yourself and your family from meningococcal disease. Because the risk increases with close or prolonged contact with an infected person, family members in the same household and caregivers are at an increased risk. There are actually four meningococcal vaccines licensed in the U.S. None of the vaccines contains live bacteria. The vaccines contain antigens -- substances that trigger the body's immune system and cause it to make antibodies. The first vaccine -- meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine or MPSV4 -- was approved in 1978. This makes it easier for the body's immune system to see and recognize the antigens. MPSV4 is the only vaccine licensed for use in people over 55 as well as people 2 to 55. Both vaccines have proven effective is protecting those aged 10-25, but have also been found to be useful for older patients. The MCV4, MPSV4 and MenB vaccines are about 85-90% effective in preventing meningococcal disease. There are actually several types of N meningitidis -- the bacterium that causes meningococcal disease, five of which are common in the U.S. MCV4 has not been available long enough to compare the long-term effectiveness of the two vaccines. Because the vaccines do not protect against all causes of meningitis, it is still possible that someone could receive the vaccine and still get meningitis from a different strain not protected by the vaccine. But the risk of contracting meningococcal meningitis is significantly lower after the vaccine. Vaccines like the Hib vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine are also very effective at protecting against other causes of meningitis and should be included as part of a routine childhood vaccination schedule. Routine immunization with the meningococcal vaccine MCV4 is recommended for children aged 11 or 12, with a booster to be given between ages 16 and 18. Vaccinations are also recommended for the following groups: College freshmen living in a dorm Military recruits Someone who has a damaged spleen Someone whose spleen has been removed Someone with terminal complement component deficiency (an immune system problem) Microbiologists who are routinely exposed to meningococcal bacteria Someone traveling to or residing in a country where the disease is common Someone who has been exposed to meningitis Preteens who are 11 and 12 usually have the shot at their 11- or 12-year-old checkup. An appointment should be made to get the shot for teenagers who did not have it when they were 11 or 12. Anyone who is allergic to any component used in the vaccine should not get the vaccine. But people who are moderately or severely ill at the time of vaccine administration should wait until they recover. With any vaccine, there is the potential of a severe allergic reaction within a few minutes to a few hours after the shot. But the likelihood that the meningococcal vaccines would cause a severe reaction is extremely slight. About one out of every two people who get the shot experience mild reactions such as redness or a mild pain where the shot was given. There have been reports that a few people have been diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) after receiving MCV4. In that same time period, there have been 99 confirmed cases of GBS, a serious nervous system disorder, reported within six weeks of the vaccine being taken. There is not enough data at this time to tell whether or not the vaccine was a factor. The CDC is continuing to study the issue and has recommended that people be told about the study when they are considering the vaccine. The current opinion is that even if there is a slight increase in the risk of GBS, it's significantly outweighed by the risk of meningococcal disease without the vaccine. Talk to your doctor if you have any further concerns about the vaccine and GBS."], [1625, "Children's Vaccines Flu Vaccine", "For most of us, getting the flu means several days of feeling pretty miserable. Headaches, body aches, high fevers, chills, fatigue, and exhaustion are all part of the disease running its course. But there are some people -- primarily young children, older adults, and people with chronic health conditions such as asthma -- who are at higher risk of seasonal flu-related complications. Fortunately, there are ways to protect yourself against seasonal flu, and the primary way to prevent it is to get an annual vaccination. This article explains what you need to know about the seasonal flu vaccine. There are actually two kinds of vaccines: One is given as a shot (an injection) and one is given as a nasal spray. Neither vaccine causes flu illness (although the nasal spray can result in congestion and runny nose). The nasal spray can be given to healthy, non-pregnant individuals ages 2 to 49. If you have any question about whether you or your child can use the nasal spray vaccine, talk with your doctor. The flu shot can be given to children and teens ages 6 months to 19 years, pregnant women, adults ages 50 and older, people with certain chronic medical conditions, people who live in facilities such as nursing homes, and people who live with or take care of others who are at high risk for flu complications. These injections, approved for those ages 18 to 64, use smaller needles and only go into the top layer of the skin instead of deeper into the muscle. For those age 65 and older, a high-dose version of the flu vaccine called Fluzone is recommended when available. Each year, a panel of experts from agencies such as the FDA and the CDC studies the available data and decide which three or four strains of influenza viruses will most likely be active during the next flu season. It takes about two weeks for the body to become protected after getting the seasonal flu vaccine. The viruses used in the vaccine may not be the only strains causing the flu; it's possible you could be infected with a virus you do not have immunity against. People who get the flu after getting a flu shot typically have a milder and shorter case of flu. That includes: People with chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, heart disease, lung disease, and a weakened immune system, such as from HIV/AIDS or as a result of therapy. Pregnant women Residents of nursing homes and other facilities where people have chronic medical conditions Health care workers People planning to travel to the tropics at any time and people who were not vaccinated but are going to the Southern Hemisphere from April through September People ages 50 years and older. Caregivers and household contacts of anyone in a high-risk group The vaccine is also recommended for anyone else who wants to be protected against this year's flu. If a child is between 6 months and 8 years and is being vaccinated against flu for the first time (or was vaccinated for the first time during the previous flu season but only got one dose), he or she should get two doses, separated by at least 4 weeks. People who should not get a flu shot include: Infants under age 6 months Anyone who has had a severe reaction to a past flu shot or nasal spray Someone with Guillain-Barre syndrome or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy People with moderate to severe illness with a fever; they should be vaccinated after they have recovered. However, the American College of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology says the vaccine contains such a low amount of egg protein that it's unlikely to cause an allergic reaction in those with an egg allergy. If you have a severe egg allergy (anaphylaxis), talk to your doctor before getting the flu vaccine. The vaccine should be given by a health care provider with experience in managing allergic signs and symptoms and should be watched closely for at least 30 minutes. So, the best time to get a shot is as soon as the vaccine becomes available. But if you didn't get one before the season started, it's a good idea to still get one during the season to lower your risk of getting sick? And some have mild side effects like a headache, cough, body aches, or fever. The nasal spray sometimes causes mild symptoms, including: runny nose, congestion, or cough headache vomiting muscle aches fever There are several places where you can go to get a flu vaccine, including: Health care settings such as a doctor's office and health clinics Pharmacies Supermarkets Community groups The CDC's Flu.gov and the American Lung Association's web sites have an interactive seasonal flu clinic locator that you can use to find a location for a flu vaccine near you."], [1626, "Children's Vaccines Rotavirus (RV)", "Rotavirus gets its name from the fact that, under a microscope, the virus resembles a wheel. This nasty, potentially lethal bug causes severe acute gastroenteritis with diarrhea and vomiting, primarily in infants and young children. Prior to the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine, rotavirus infection was responsible for 200,000 emergency room visits, 55,000 hospitalizations, and 60 to 65 deaths each year in the U.S. Worldwide, it is the leading cause of severe diarrhea among young children, leading to 2 million hospitalizations and more than 500,000 deaths of children ages 5 and under annually. Older children and adults can also be infected with the virus, but the illness is generally milder. The germ is present in the stool of an infected person and can remain viable for a long time on contaminated surfaces, including people's hands. The spread of rotavirus infection is a particular problem in hospitals and in day care settings, where it can be easily spread from child to child. Symptoms of rotavirus infection, which may last up to eight days, include fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and frequent, watery diarrhea. If it's severe enough, the diarrhea can cause dehydration, and it's the dehydration that's responsible for the hospitalizations and deaths associated with this disease. There are two brands of the rotavirus vaccine -- RotaTeq (RV5) and Rotarix (RV1). The vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that the rotavirus vaccine be included as part of the routine immunizations given to infants. Studies of the rotavirus vaccine have shown that it can prevent about 74% of rotavirus infections. In one Massachusetts hospital, in two years, the number of people with rotavirus dropped from 65 to three. Before being approved, the rotavirus vaccine was tested on more than 70,000 children and found to be safe. However, an earlier vaccine, called RotaShield, was removed from the market after being used for two years, because it was found to slightly increase the risk of intussusception -- a condition in which the small bowel folds back inside another part of the intestine, causing a bowel obstruction. The RotaTeq and Rotarix vaccines now in use do not appear to increase this risk and are considered safe. Any child who has had a severe allergic reaction to an earlier dose of the rotavirus vaccine should not be given any more doses of the vaccine. Signs of an allergic reaction can include: Difficulty breathing Wheezing Hives Paleness Fast heart beat However, with the rotavirus vaccine, the risk of a serious reaction is extremely small."], [1627, "Children's Vaccines Pneumococcal (PCV13)", "There are two vaccines available to protect children from pneumococcal disease, a serious infection caused by a bacterium known as Streptococcus pneumoniae. Only one of the vaccines, PCV13, is considered safe for children under the age of 2, This vaccine is important because infants and very young children are at higher risk for several dangerous infections, including pneumonia and bacterial meningitis. The second vaccine, PPSV23, has been available for more than 30 years and is recommended for children two years and older. Pneumococcal disease is an infection caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae or pneumococcus. People can be infected with the bacteria, or they can carry it in their throat, and not be ill. Those carriers can still spread it, primarily in droplets from their nose or mouth when they breathe, cough, or sneeze. Depending on what organ or part of the body is infected, pneumococcal disease will cause any of several serious illnesses, including: Bacterial meningitis, an infection of the covering of the brain and spinal cord that can lead to confusion, coma, and death as well as other physical effects, such as blindness or paralysis Pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that creates cough, fever, and difficulty breathing Otitis media, a middle ear infection that can cause pain, swelling, sleeplessness, fever, and irritability Bacteremia, a dangerous infection of the blood stream Sinus infections There are more than 6,000 deaths each year in the U.S. as a result of pneumococcal disease. More than half of those deaths are in adults who, according to CDC recommendations, should have been vaccinated. In children under age 5, infection with the pneumococcus bacteria results in approximately 480 cases of meningitis and 4,000 cases of bacteremia or other invasive infection per year. A major problem in very young children is that the classic symptoms of meningitis and pneumonia are often not present, making the disease hard to recognize. But with PCV (the vaccine recommended for young children) and PPSV (the vaccine for adults and older children), the risk of serious harm or death is extremely small. In studies involving nearly 60,000 doses of the PCV vaccine, there have been no moderate or severe reactions. The mild side effects included: Redness, tenderness, or swelling where the shot is given in about one out of every four infants Fever higher than 100.4 F in about one out of every three infants Fever higher than 102.2 F in about one out of every 50 children Occasional incidence of fussiness, drowsiness, or loss of appetite About one out of every two adults who receive the PPSV vaccine experiences redness or pain where the shot is given. The PCV7 vaccine that covered seven strains of pneumococcal bacteria, has now been updated to the PCV13 vaccine, which covers 13 strains. The PPSV vaccine is recommended for any adult ages 19 through 64 who smokes or has asthma and anyone ages 2 through 64 who is taking a drug or treatment that affects the body's immune system. In addition, anyone ages 2 through 64 who has one of the following (or similar) health conditions that affect the immune system should be vaccinated with PPSV: Hodgkin's disease lymphoma or leukemia kidney failure multiple myeloma nephrotic syndrome HIV infection or AIDS damaged spleen or no spleen organ transplant heart disease lung disease sickle cell disease diabetes alcoholism cirrhosis leaks of cerebrospinal fluid cochlear implant It's now recommended that adults who are ages 65 and older get both the PCV13 and the PPSV23 vaccine. The timing and sequence of the vaccines will vary depending on what vaccines you may have previously had. If you are over age 65 or have an underlying medical condition that puts you at risk and have not had a pneumococcal vaccination, talk to your doctor and ask to schedule one. According to the National Foundation for Infectious Disease, bacteremia and meningitis caused by invasive pneumococcal disease is responsible for the highest rates of death among the elderly and patients who have underlying medical conditions."], [1628, "Children's Vaccines H. influenzae (Hib)", "It does, however, cause Hib disease, a serious health threat to children, especially those under age 5. Fortunately, the Hib vaccine, available since 1992, provides safe and effective protection against that threat. Hib disease is an invasive bacterial infection that at one time was the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in young children; invasive means that germs spread to parts of the body that are normally germ-free. Bacterial meningitis is a serious infection that can cause fever, decline in cognitive ability, coma, and death. In addition to meningitis, Hib can cause pneumonia; epiglottitis, which is an infection in the throat that can cause breathing difficulties; blood infection; bone infection; and joint infection leading to arthritis. Before use of the vaccine, there were about 20,000 cases of Hib disease each year in children under age 5 -- 12,000 of which were meningitis -- and about 1,000 deaths per year. The Hib bacterium has a coating; the Hib vaccine is made from this coating, which, when bonded with a protein, can cause the body's defenses to build up immunity to Hib. Since the whole bacterium isn't used, it cannot cause Hib infection and so cannot cause Hib disease. The most common side effects include soreness, swelling, or redness at the site of the injection. The Hib vaccine is generally given as part of a child's regular vaccination routine. The CDC recommends that the vaccine be given to children under age 5. Because Hib disease is very rare in older children and because most adults have antibodies for Hib in their system, the vaccine is not recommended for anyone ages 5 or older, unless they are at increased risk for Hib infection. Older children and adults at increased risk include: Anyone who has had his spleen removed and anyone who has sickle cell disease, leukemia, or HIV Anyone whose immune system has been suppressed due to a condition or by a treatment, such as for cancer Different vaccines have been licensed for use in the U.S. The vaccines are equally effective and one can be substituted for the other if the original vaccine the child received is not available. The number of doses that are required for full immunity -- either three or four -- depends on which vaccine is being used. For adults and older children who are at increased risk and have never been vaccinated, at least one dose of the vaccine is needed for protection. The CDC recommends that an infant receive the first dose at age 2 months, the second dose at age 4 months, and the third dose, depending on which vaccine is being used, at age 6 months. If your child misses a dose, he or she should be given a catch-up shot at the next doctor visit. The risk, though, is far less than it would be without the Hib vaccine."], [1629, "Children's Vaccines Chickenpox (Varicella)", "The chickenpox vaccine is a shot that can protect nearly anyone who receives the vaccine from catching chickenpox. The vaccine is made from a live but weakened, or attenuated, virus. Although the virus in the chickenpox vaccine is generally incapable of causing a disease, it still stimulates a response from the body's immune system. That response is what gives someone who's had a shot for chickenpox immunity or protection from the illness. Most cases of chickenpox are relatively mild and run their course in five to 10 days. Before the varicella vaccine was licensed in the U.S. in 1995, there were approximately 100 deaths and more than 11,000 hospitalizations a year from chickenpox. The risk of serious, life-threatening complications is greatest among infants, elderly adults, and people with weakened immune systems. For that reason, children with chickenpox need to be kept out of school or day care for about a week or more until all blisters have dried and crusted over. So even if the illness is mild, it still means five to 10 days of being uncomfortable. Most states require that children entering child care, school and even colleges and universities, show evidence of immunity to chickenpox either by having had the illness or documentation of receiving the chickenpox vaccine. The chickenpox vaccine is recommended for all children under age 13 who have not had chickenpox. Older children and adults should have two shots, with four to eight weeks between the first and second shot. But the side effects associated with the varicella vaccine are generally mild. A small percentage of people develop a mild rash, usually around the spot where the shot was given. Anyone who is moderately to severely ill when a chickenpox shot is scheduled should wait until the illness passes before getting the shot. Also, anyone who had an allergic reaction to the first shot should not get the second shot. Other people who should not get the shot include: Pregnant women, because the vaccine's effect on the fetus is not known Anyone allergic to gelatin; a gelatin-free version of the varicella vaccine is available. Anyone allergic to neomycin Anyone with an immune system disease Anyone receiving high doses of steroids Anyone being treated for cancer with X-rays, drugs, or chemotherapy Anyone who had a transfusion or received blood products within five months prior to the shot About 2% of the children who are vaccinated develop a very mild case of chickenpox, usually with no more than five to six blisters. It is also possible for a person who has been vaccinated for chickenpox to develop chickenpox at some later point in life. When that happens, the disease is almost always milder and the recovery more rapid than for people who have not had the shots. But it's important to keep in mind that up to 90% of the people who get the vaccine will not catch chickenpox."], [1630, "Children's Vaccines Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR)", "The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is recommended for all children. It is a two-part vaccination, and in most states, you must prove your children have gotten it before they can enter school. If you are an adult who has not had the vaccination or the diseases, you may need the MMR shot, too. Measles starts as a fever, cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis (pinkeye), and a red, pinpoint rash that starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Measles in older children can lead to inflammation of the brain, called encephalitis, which can cause seizures and brain damage. The mumps virus usually causes swelling in glands just below the ears, giving the appearance of chipmunk cheeks. Before the vaccine, mumps was the most common cause of both meningitis (inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord) and acquired deafness in the U.S. It can cause a mild rash on the face, swelling of glands behind the ears, and in some cases, swelling of the small joints and low-grade fever. MMR is a two-shot series of vaccines usually given during childhood. A child should receive the first shot when he is between 12-15 months, and the second when he's between 4-6 years of age. If you're not sure if you have had the diseases or the vaccines (prior to 1971 it was given in three separate shots), you can get the MMR vaccine as an adult. (If you were born during or before 1956, you are presumed to be immune, because many children had the diseases then.) You shouldn't have the shot if: You have a severe allergic reaction following the first MMR shot. Most people who receive the MMR vaccine have no side effects. Some have fever or minor soreness and redness where they got the shot. They include: Fever (1 in 5 children) Rash (1 in 20) Swollen glands (1 in 7) Seizure (1 in 3,000) Joint pain/stiffness (1 in 100 children; more common in adults, particularly women) Low platelet count/bleeding (1 in 30,000) Encephalitis (1 in 1 million) Over the years, some have suggested that the MMR vaccine is linked to autism spectrum disorder. The CDC stands firm that there's no evidence to support that idea. The benefits that the vaccine brings in disease prevention far outweigh any potential risks."], [1631, "Children's Vaccines Polio (IPV)", "But the disease is still common in some developing countries and until it is eradicated worldwide, the risk of it spreading to the U.S. still exists. If you had the polio vaccination prior to 2000, you may have received the oral polio vaccine (OPV), which was made from a live poliovirus. Using an inactive (dead) form of the virus that cannot cause polio, the IPV is given as a shot in the arm or leg. Children should be vaccinated with four doses of IPV at the following ages: A dose at 2 months A dose at 4 months A dose at 6-18 months A booster dose at 4-6 years IPV may be given at the same time as other vaccinations. Because most adults were vaccinated as children, routine polio vaccination is not recommended for people ages 18 and older who live in the U.S. But three groups of adults at higher risk for coming into contact with the poliovirus should consider polio vaccination. They are: Travelers to other parts of the world where polio is still common People who work in labs handling specimens that might contain polioviruses Health care workers who have close contact with a person who could be infected with the poliovirus If you fall into any of these three groups you should speak to your health care provider about the polio vaccination. If you have never been vaccinated against polio, you should get three doses of IPV: The first dose at any time The second dose 1 to 2 months later The third dose 6 to 12 months after the second If you have had one or two doses of polio vaccine in the past you should get the remaining one or two doses. You should not receive the polio vaccine if: You have had a severe allergic reaction from a previous dose of the polio vaccine You have had a severe allergic reaction to the antibiotics streptomycin, polymyxin B, or neomycin Although no side effects have been reported in pregnant women who have received the vaccine, pregnant women should avoid the vaccine if possible. Pregnant women who fall into one of the groups of adults listed above should speak with their doctors about receiving an IPV according to the recommended schedule for adults. Some people who get the polio shot get a sore, red spot where the shot was given, but otherwise the vaccine is very safe. The risk that the vaccine could cause any serious harm is extremely small."], [1632, "Children's Vaccines Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis (DTaP)", "DTaP is a vaccine that helps children younger than age 7 develop immunity to three deadly diseases caused by bacteria: diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough (pertussis). Pertussis, also highly contagious, causes coughing spasms so severe that in infants it makes it difficult to eat, drink, or even breathe. Vaccines protect the community by preventing the spread of disease from one person to the next, which even offers some protection to the unvaccinated. If people stopped getting vaccinated, the incidence of these three diseases would rapidly rise and thousands would get sick and perhaps even die. Both vaccines contain inactivated forms of the toxin produced by the bacteria that cause the three diseases. Tdap, which has a reduced dose of the diphtheria and pertussis vaccines, is approved for adolescents starting at age 11 and adults ages 19 to 64. It is often called a booster dose because it boosts the immunity that wanes from vaccines given at ages 4 to 6. The current recommendation is that one dose of the Tdap vaccine be substituted for one dose of the Td vaccine between the ages of 11 and 64. Pregnant women are also advised to get the Tdap vaccine, preferably between 27 and 36 weeks' gestation. Children ages 7 through 10 who aren't fully vaccinated against pertussis, including children never vaccinated or with an unknown vaccination status, should get a single dose of the Tdap vaccine. Teens ages 13 through 18 who haven't gotten the Tdap vaccine yet should get a dose, followed by a booster of tetanus and diphtheria (Td) every 10 years. Children should receive five doses of the DTaP vaccine according to the following schedule: One dose at 2 months of age One dose at 4 months of age One dose at 6 months of age One dose at 15 to 18 months of age One dose at 4 to 6 years of age The CDC recommends that children who are moderately or severely ill at the time they are scheduled to receive the vaccine should wait until they recover before getting it. Minor illnesses like a cold or low-grade fever, however, should not prevent a child from receiving a dose of the vaccine. If a child has a life-threatening allergic reaction after receiving a dose of the vaccine, that child should not be given another dose. A child who suffered a brain or nervous system disease within seven days of receiving the vaccine should not be given another dose. Some children may have a bad reaction to the pertussis vaccine in DTaP and should not take another dose. Talk with your doctor if your child experienced any of the following reactions: Had a seizure or collapsed after a dose of DTaP Cried nonstop for 3 hours or more after a dose of DTaP Had a fever over 105 F after a dose of DTaP Like any medicine, vaccines can have side effects. But the risk of experiencing a serious problem to DTaP or Tdap is extremely small. On the other hand, the risk of your child contracting a major illness like diphtheria or pertussis is extremely high without the vaccine. If it were going to happen it would most likely happen within a few minutes to a couple of hours after taking the vaccine. Symptoms might include any of the following: difficulty breathing hoarseness wheezing hives paleness weakness rapid heart beat dizziness Other very rare problems that have been reported include long-term seizures, coma or lowered consciousness, and brain damage. These problems have occurred so rarely that the CDC says it's impossible to tell whether they were actually related to the vaccine or caused by something else. They include: fever redness or swelling at the site of the shot soreness or tenderness at the site of the shot fussiness tiredness vomiting These problems could occur within one to three days after the shot and generally pass quickly."], [1633, "Children's Vaccines All Vaccines Schedules", "After getting approval from several expert groups, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the following immunization schedules: Childhood Immunization Schedule: Ages 0 to 6 Years (What is a PDF document?)

This type of drug, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, is sometimes prescribed for pain and sleep problems. It seems to work best when used for nerve pain. Antidepressant medicine is prescribed by a doctor to ease depression and anxiety, improve your ability to concentrate, and help you sleep better.

For regular support you can count on, work with a professional counselor, a CFS support group, or both. Sign \"release of information\" forms so that your doctors can work together as a team.

If one treatment doesn't work, you and your doctor can try another until you find what works best for you. First try an over-the-counter pain reliever, like acetaminophen (such as Tylenol), ibuprofen (such as Advil or Motrin), or naproxen (such as Aleve). There are different types of prescription medicines that help with pain, such as antidepressants for chronic pain and narcotic medicine for severe pain. A narcotic is a short-term treatment because it can become addictive if you use it a lot. Other treatments that can help with CFS pain include acupuncture, massage, or yoga. Even when you have more energy, keep a low-key pace throughout each day. Adjust your daily schedule to take advantage of times when you have more energy.

Studies have shown that a carefully planned graded exercise program can help some people with CFS regain their strength and energy and feel better.2Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Using Graded Exercise to Get More Energy Try cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). This is a type of counseling that has been shown to help some people who have CFS feel less tired.2 It teaches you how to change the way you think and do things. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Using Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Living with CFS can be as much a mental health challenge as it is a physical one. It's easy to get caught in a cycle of frustration, anger, and depression. For support and help with mood problems, you can also work with a professional counselor who understands CFS. Visit your doctor every few months to help track your symptoms and check for any need to change your treatment. For example: A rehabilitation specialist can help you start a graded exercise plan. There are many unproven remedies, such as special diets or mineral supplements, that some people recommend for treating CFS. Physical illnesses can be made worse-or better-by your feelings and attitudes, and vice versa."], [1640, "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Exams and Tests", "It is common to have normal test results when you have CFS. CFS can be diagnosed only by ruling out other conditions. First, your doctor will ask you about past health and do a physical exam. Doctors use a variety of tests to rule out other conditions. This gives important information about the kinds and numbers of cells in your blood. This is a blood test that provides information about your general state of health. Urinalysis, a urine test that can provide information about your overall health and clues to many conditions. Other tests may be done if your symptoms, history, and physical exam suggest other possible problems. These other tests may include: ANA (antinuclear antibodies), to check for lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus). Rheumatoid factor, to check for rheumatoid arthritis. HIV test, to check for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Tests for Lyme disease, if you may have been exposed to ticks. Hepatitis A, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C tests. Some doctors may order tests that check your immune system. That's because so little is known about the immune system's connection to chronic fatigue syndrome."], [1641, "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome When To Call a Doctor", "Call your doctor if you have: Severe fatigue that lasts longer than 2 weeks, causes you to limit your usual activities, and does not improve with rest. Sleep problems that last for more than 1 to 2 months. These problems may include being unable to fall asleep or stay asleep, tossing and turning, and waking up feeling tired or not rested. Watchful waiting refers to a period of time in which you are being watched by your doctor but are not getting treatment. A month or two of paying close attention to your sleep habits, getting regular moderate exercise, trying to control stress, and eating a balanced diet will take care of most cases of fatigue not caused by CFS or another medical problem. But if your fatigue has not improved after 1 to 2 months of self-care, or if fatigue won't go away and limits your usual activities, call your doctor. If you have been diagnosed with CFS, pay attention to any new symptoms and report them to your doctor. Although CFS can cause a variety of symptoms, new symptoms could be caused by another illness or medical condition that may need to be evaluated and treated. Get a recommendation from your family doctor or a local CFS support group before you make an appointment with a specialist."], [1642, "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome What Increases Your Risk", "People who have chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are generally 25 to 45 years of age. It may occur in teens, especially young teenage girls. Unlike adults, teens are more likely to develop CFS after having a flu-like illness."], [1643, "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome What Happens", "In some cases, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) develops after a flu-like illness such as mononucleosis (mono) or after a period of unusual stress. But it may also occur without warning, even if you have not been sick. Because fatigue can be vague and can be caused by many things, you might not pay attention to the problem for several weeks or months. Some people have severe fatigue and other symptoms for many years. Some people find the fatigue, pain, and thinking problems caused by CFS greatly hamper their lives. Most people are still able to do some of their usual activities at home and work, but they often are unusually tired after they do them. People often have to cut down on social and recreational activities to save their energy for work and family. Other people have trouble doing most or all of their daily activities, including work and the basic chores of daily living. People with severe CFS have trouble getting out of bed and need help with basic activities such as dressing, eating, and bathing."], [1644, "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Symptoms", "Symptoms can change in a day, and from day to day. There is broad range of CFS symptoms. But there is a core set of symptoms that affect nearly everyone with CFS. These core symptoms are: Extreme physical fatigue, mental fatigue, or both. This fatigue also is so severe that it interferes with your work, your play, and your social activities. This can mean you feel ill or weak or your CFS symptoms are worse. It can take more than 24 hours to feel better. Pain, which can be widespread or in one place. CFS pain can be in one area, then move to another. A person with CFS also has two or more of these symptoms: Problems with concentration, short-term memory, or thinking of the right word Being very sensitive to light, noise, or emotions Confusion, slow thinking, or feeling disoriented Muscle weakness or muscle coordination problems CFS also causes the following symptoms. Different people with CFS have different combinations of: Lightheadedness and dizziness, very fast heartbeat, or shortness of breath when active. Low body temperature, cold hands and feet, sweating, or trouble with heat or cold. Having depression along with CFS is common and can make CFS symptoms worse. CFS causes symptoms that are the same as many other diseases, especially early on. For this reason, it can be diagnosed only after a thorough evaluation has ruled out other conditions with similar symptoms."], [1645, "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Cause", "For many people, CFS symptoms start after a viral illness. In some cases, CFS seems to follow a major physical or emotional trauma or an exposure to toxins. Other theories point to the immune system, glands and hormones, and family history."], [1646, "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Health Tools", "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Using Graded Exercise to Get More Energy Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Using Healthy Thinking Insomnia: Improving Your Sleep"], [1647, "CFS (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome)", "Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), sometimes called myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), is a condition that makes you feel so tired that you can't do all of your normal, daily activities. There are other symptoms too, but being very tired is the main one. Some people have severe fatigue and other symptoms for many years. CFS is not well understood. Most experts now believe that it is a separate illness with its own set of symptoms. Because of this, many people have trouble accepting their disease or getting their friends and family to do so. It is your body's reaction to a mix of factors. Sometimes it begins after a viral infection, but there is no proof of any connection. It's likely that a number of factors or triggers come together to cause CFS. Extreme tiredness, or fatigue, is the main symptom. If you have CFS: You may feel exhausted all or much of the time. Or you may wake up feeling tired or not rested. It may be harder for you to think clearly, to concentrate, and to remember things. You may also have headaches, muscle and joint pain, a sore throat, and tender glands in your neck or armpits. Your symptoms may flare up after a mental or physical activity that used to be no problem for you. Depression is common with CFS, and it can make your other symptoms worse. Doctors can diagnose it by ruling out other possible causes of your fatigue and by using a set of rules. Many other health problems can cause fatigue. Here is one set of criteria (rules) that doctors use to diagnose chronic fatigue syndrome:1 The fatigue and the other symptoms must last, or come and go, for at least 6 months in adults or 3 months in children. The symptoms cannot be explained by another illness. All of these symptoms must be present:Extreme physical or mental fatigueNot feeling well after being active (post-exertional malaise)Sleep problemsPain Extreme physical or mental fatigue Not feeling well after being active (post-exertional malaise) Sleep problems Pain Two or more of these symptoms related to brain function must be present: Problems with concentration, short-term memory, or thinking of the right wordBeing very sensitive to light, noise, or emotionsConfusion, slow thinking, or feeling disorientedMuscle weakness or muscle coordination problems Problems with concentration, short-term memory, or thinking of the right word Being very sensitive to light, noise, or emotions Confusion, slow thinking, or feeling disoriented Muscle weakness or muscle coordination problems One or more symptoms from two of these groups must be present:Recurrent flu-like symptoms, sore throats, tender lymph nodes, or new sensitivities to food, medicines, odors, or chemicalsLow body temperature, cold hands and feet, sweating, or feeling worse when under stressLightheadedness and dizziness, very fast heartbeat, or shortness of breath when active Recurrent flu-like symptoms, sore throats, tender lymph nodes, or new sensitivities to food, medicines, odors, or chemicals Low body temperature, cold hands and feet, sweating, or feeling worse when under stress Lightheadedness and dizziness, very fast heartbeat, or shortness of breath when active There is no treatment for CFS itself, but many of its symptoms can be treated. That's because the two of you will need to work together to find a combination of medicines and behavior changes that will help you get better. Some trial and error may be needed, because no single combination of treatments works for everyone. Home treatment is very important. You may need to change your daily schedule, learn better sleep habits, and use regular gentle movement or exercise to fight fatigue. Living with CFS can be as much a mental health challenge as it is a physical one. Take steps to avoid getting caught in a cycle of frustration, anger, and depression. Learning to cope with your symptoms and talking to others who have CFS can help.

Major symptoms of this disorder may include widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), a groove (cleft) on the tip of the nose, an unusually wide mouth, malformations of the fingers and toes, and/or underdevelopment of portions of the face (midface hypoplasia), such as the forehead, nose, and chin. In addition, the head may have an unusual shape due to premature closure of the fibrous joints (sutures) between certain bones in the skull (coronal synostosis)."], [1649, "CF (Cystic Fibrosis)", "Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that causes mucus in the body to become thick and sticky. This glue-like mucus builds up and causes problems in many of the body's organs, especially the lungs and the pancreas . People who have cystic fibrosis can have serious breathing problems and lung disease. They can also have problems with nutrition, digestion, and growth. The life expectancy for people with cystic fibrosis has been steadily increasing. Cystic fibrosis is one of the most common genetic disorders in white children in the United States and Canada. It's caused by a change, or mutation, in a gene. The changed gene is passed down in families. To pass on this disease, both parents must be carriers of the changed gene. Cystic fibrosis is usually diagnosed at an early age. But some common symptoms in a baby who has cystic fibrosis include: A blocked small intestine at birth. Breathing problems, lung infections, a cough that does not go away, and wheezing. Other symptoms may also develop in childhood, such as: Clubbing (rounding and flattening) of the fingers. Rectal prolapse (when part of the rectum protrudes from the anus). Babies in the United States and Canada are tested for cystic fibrosis right after birth. Screening tests look for a certain health problem before any symptoms appear. The doctor may also notice the signs of cystic fibrosis during a routine exam. If your child has a positive newborn screening test or symptoms of cystic fibrosis, your doctor will order a sweat test to see how much salt is in your child's sweat. People with cystic fibrosis have sweat that is much saltier than normal. The types of treatment your child receives depends on what kinds of health problems the cystic fibrosis is causing and how your child's body responds to different types of treatment. Doctors usually recommend a combination of medicines, home treatment methods (including respiratory and nutritional therapies), and other specialized care to manage the disease. What causes it? What kinds of medicines are used? Can cystic fibrosis affect fertility? How does cystic fibrosis affect the respiratory system?"], [1650, "Central Precocious Puberty", "It may seem like kids are growing up faster these days. Puberty usually starts around age 7 1/2 in girls and around age 9 in boys. For some children, such as those who are African-American or Hispanic, normal puberty may happen as early as age 6 in girls and age 8 in boys. But with CPP, signs of puberty, such as budding breasts and body hair, show up much sooner than parents might anticipate. When it does happen in boys, there's a good chance there's an underlying, potentially serious medical cause that needs to be treated. Puberty is a big change, even when it happens on schedule. Early puberty can also cause problems with bone growth. If it's too soon, you can slow or even reverse the changes in their body. They tell the sex organs to make other hormones that start sexual development. In central precocious puberty, the brain releases GnRH at a younger-than-normal age and starts the process. Most of the time, doctors can't pinpoint an exact cause for girls, but researchers have linked childhood obesity to early periods. Other causes include: A family history of CPP A rare gene problem A noncancerous tumor in the brain or pituitary gland A brain injury An infection in the brain, like meningitis Radiation or chemotherapy for cancer treatment The signs of CPP are the changes you'd expect to see in a maturing preteen or teen. Hair in underarms and on private parts, and, for boys, on the face Acne Adult body odor Sexual development like breast buds, or testicle growth Emotional changes Mood swings Sometimes, kids can have hair appear in their private area and under the arm, but it doesn't mean they are in true puberty. If the symptoms aren't severe, it can be hard to tell if it's CPP. Your doctor may want your child to see a doctor who focuses on children's hormones and growth, called a pediatric endocrinologist. He'll look for signs of puberty, but he may also check: Hormone levels Bone age Blood tests check levels of hormones. These tests scan and make pictures of the inside of the body and brain. For an older child, early development might be normal. In some cases, doctors can use a drug to block sex hormones and prevent further development. The doctor can give your child a shot once a month or every 3 months, or he could put a small implant under the skin of your child's upper arm, which works for a year. Where they get the shot or implant may hurt a bit, or their skin might get irritated around that spot, but there don't seem to be any long-term side effects. You'll probably want to keep up the treatment until your child gets old enough to let puberty continue -- around age 11 for girls and 12 for boys. When you're thinking about whether to treat CPP in an older child, you'll want to think about: Your child's age How slow or fast they're developing How your child has been reacting The chance of early menstruation Concerns about their height as an adult Talk these things over with your child's doctor before you make any decisions. Most kids want to fit in with their peers. Other people may expect more maturity because they think your kid is older than he or she is. These challenges plus the emotional changes from extra hormones can be a lot for them to deal with. Check in with the teachers and counselors at school, and keep an eye on your child's grades. Pay attention to their interest in things and being around friends and classmates. Try to focus your praise on academics or activities, rather than appearance. An early growth spurt can make your child taller than their friends at first, but their bones may stop growing earlier, too. Without treatment, your child may end up shorter than they could have been. With treatment, they're more likely to reach their full adult height. Their sexual development will stall and may even reverse. For example, a girl's breasts and a boy's penis and testicles could get smaller. Your child should start acting like other kids their age, too. The treatment shouldn't affect them having kids of their own later, either. You can connect with other families whose kids are dealing with CPP. The MAGIC Foundation offers information and support for many conditions, including central precocious puberty."], [1651, "Carcinoid Syndrome", "Carcinoid syndrome is a group of symptoms you might get if you already have a type of cancer called carcinoid tumors. The symptoms can be similar to other illnesses, like asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, and menopause. You may have episodes when your skin suddenly gets red and warm, you have trouble breathing, or you have a rapid heartbeat, for example. Carcinoid tumors usually grow in your stomach and intestines, but you can also get them in your lungs, pancreas, or rarely, testicles or ovaries. If you have carcinoid syndrome, it usually means that your cancer has spread to another area, most often your lungs or liver. Although often there's no cure for carcinoid tumors, treatments can help you live longer and better. You can also take steps to relieve the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome and feel more comfortable. Find people you can talk to about your plans, your fears, and your feelings. When the tumors are in your digestive tract, a common place for them to grow, extra hormones usually go into a blood vessel that takes them to your liver, which makes them inactive. Instead, they may start moving through your bloodstream to affect different parts of your body and cause symptoms. You could get carcinoid syndrome from tumors in the lungs, testes, or ovaries. People with carcinoid syndrome may have: Skin that turns a pink, red, or purple color Small, widened blood vessels on their face Diarrhea Shortness of breath or wheezing Rapid heart rate Sudden drops in blood pressure Carcinoid syndrome can also cause complications. Medicine can help, and in some cases you might need surgery. Carcinoid crisis isn't very common, but you might have a severe episode of blushing, breathing trouble, and confusion. If your doctor thinks you have carcinoid syndrome, he'll do a physical exam and may ask you questions like: Have there been times when your skin suddenly got red and felt warm or burning? You may also need tests to look for a carcinoid tumor. A lab will check the pee that you've collected in containers over a 24-hour period for high levels of hormones or what's left when your body breaks them down. A CT scan is a series of X-rays that makes detailed views of the inside of your body. For radionuclide scanning, your doctor will inject you with a small amount of radioactive material that the organs in your body absorb. A special camera can spot the material and make pictures that help your doctor find a tumor. Where are the tumors that are causing my carcinoid syndrome? To treat carcinoid syndrome, your doctors will need to treat your tumors. You could need just one or a combination of treatments. Doctors may take out an entire organ that has tumors, such as your appendix, or remove only part of an affected area, such as a section of your bowel. Depending on where the tumor is, surgeons may also use an electric current to burn it off or do cryosurgery to freeze it. Strong medicines can often kill your cancer cells or slow their growth. The radiation can come from a machine outside your body, or your doctor may place a small amount of radioactive material inside your body, in or near the tumor. This type of treatment, which is also called immunotherapy, strengthens your body's defense system. Injected drugs such as lanreotide and octreotide can help with skin flushing. They may also have a small effect on stopping tumor growth. Diarrhea is a common side effect of carcinoid syndrome and taking telotristat ethyl (Xermelo) along with lanreotide or octreotide can often give relief. Lanreotide and octreotide work by attaching to carcinoid cells and cutting down on the amount of chemicals they make. Their side effects can include nausea, gallstones, and pain or bruising where you inject it. In some cases, doctors give octreotide with a low-dose injection of a man-made protein called alpha interferon to boost your body's response. You can make changes on your own to curb the effects of carcinoid syndrome. For instance, avoid certain foods and drinks that can trigger symptoms: Alcohol Nuts Cheese Chili peppers Hot liquids It might take some trial and error to see which are triggers for you. Try to eat a healthy diet, and ask your doctor if you need to take vitamins or supplements. Treatment might make the cancer that's causing your carcinoid syndrome go away. But the cancer may not be gone completely, or it could return. If your treatment stops working, you can focus on making sure you're as comfortable as possible. Consider joining a support group, where you can you share your feelings with others who understand what it's like. You can learn more about carcinoid syndrome and carcinoid tumors on the website of the Carcinoid Cancer Foundation."], [1652, "Carbon Monoxide Poisoning", "Carbon monoxide is a gas produced by burning any type of fuel-gas, oil, kerosene, wood, or charcoal. What makes this gas so dangerous is that when you breathe it, it replaces the oxygen in your blood . Without oxygen, cells throughout the body die, and the organs stop working. You can't see, smell, or taste carbon monoxide. But if you breathe too much of it, it can become deadly within minutes. So be sure you know the signs of carbon monoxide poisoning, what to do if you have the symptoms, and how to keep it from happening. Carbon monoxide can come from any source that burns fuel. Common sources are cars, fireplaces, powerboats, woodstoves, kerosene space heaters, charcoal grills, and gas appliances such as water heaters, ovens, and dryers. Trouble comes when: Cars, trucks, or other engines are left running in enclosed spaces, such as garages. Carbon monoxide can build up in a garage and leak back into the house. Even sitting in an idling car in an open garage can be dangerous. Dangerous levels of carbon monoxide can build up inside houses and other buildings. Fuel-burning heating systems and appliances are used during cold weather, when doors and windows are closed. Chimneys in older buildings become blocked and release fumes into the homes or offices. Newer houses that are well insulated and tightly sealed can trap carbon monoxide inside. As carbon monoxide builds up in your blood , symptoms get worse and may include: Confusion and drowsiness. If you have symptoms that you think could be caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, leave the area right away, and call or go to the emergency room. If you keep breathing the fumes, you may pass out and die. Breathing low levels of carbon monoxide over a long period can cause severe heart problems and brain damage. See a doctor if: You often are short of breath and have mild nausea and headaches when you are indoors. You feel better when you leave the building and worse when you return. In the winter months, doctors may suspect carbon monoxide poisoning in people who complain of severe headache, nausea, or dizziness. You may have other blood tests to check your overall health and to look for problems caused by carbon monoxide. There are two kinds of oxygen therapy: 100% oxygen therapy. For this treatment, you lie inside a chamber that delivers oxygen under high pressure. With quick treatment, most people recover within a few days. Do not leave your car running in the garage, even if the garage door is open. Do not sit in a running car or truck if the tailpipe is blocked with snow or mud. Have all fuel-burning appliances (such as oil or gas heaters, stoves, water heaters, and space heaters, fireplaces, and woodstoves) inspected each year. Check chimneys, flues, and vents regularly to make sure they are in good shape, properly connected, and not blocked. Never use a kerosene or propane heater in an enclosed area, such as a camper, motor home, trailer, or tent. Never use a gas oven to heat your home. Do not close a fireplace or stove damper before the fire is completely out. Do not use gas-powered generators, lawn equipment, or engines in enclosed areas. Understand that carbon monoxide detectors are a backup safety measure. They do not replace the need to check appliances regularly and use them safely."], [1653, "Car Seats for Children", "By law, children must be buckled up in a car seat that is made for their weight, height, and age. Set a good example for your children by always wearing your own seat belt, and always insist that they buckle up. Buy a car seat appropriate for your child's current age, weight, and height. For safety, it is very important to have a car seat that fits your child and faces the right direction. The following guidelines come from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA): Ages 0 to 12 months Your child younger than age 1 should always ride in a car seat that faces the back of the car (called rear-facing). Convertible and 3-in-1 car seats typically have higher height and weight limits for the rear-facing position, allowing you to keep your child rear-facing for a longer period of time. Ages 1 to 3 years Keep your child rear-facing in a convertible or 3-in-1 car seat as long as possible. Your child should remain rear-facing until he or she reaches the top height or weight limit allowed by your car seat's maker. As soon as your child outgrows the rear-facing car seat, your child is ready to travel in a car seat that faces the front (called forward-facing) and that has a harness. Ages 4 to 7 years Keep your child in a forward-facing car seat with a harness until he or she reaches the top height or weight limit allowed by your car seat's maker. As soon as your child outgrows the forward-facing car seat with a harness, your child can travel in a booster seat but still in the back seat. Ages 8 to 12 years Keep your child in a booster seat until he or she is big enough to fit in a seat belt properly. Remember: Your child should still ride in the back seat because it's safer there. If a car seat has been recalled or has been in an accident or misused, it may not fully protect your baby. The safest position for your baby or child is in the back, middle seat of the car. Do not place your child's car seat in the front seat of any vehicle with a passenger side air bag that cannot be turned off. Do not allow a child younger than age 13 to sit in the front seat of any vehicle. For maximum safety, follow the manufacturer's recommendations for car seat use. This feature allows parents to secure the car seat on a permanently installed hook. Certified Child Passenger Safety Technicians can help you install your car seat and position your child safely. You can also call the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration at 1-888-327-4236. If your child needs attention, stop the car, take the child out of the seat, take care of his or her needs, and put him or her back into the seat before the car starts moving again."], [1654, "Capsaicin", "You can eat it in raw or cooked peppers or as a dried powder, which you can add to food or drinks. It also is available as a dietary supplement and in topical creams that you apply to your skin. When a capsaicin cream or ointment is used on the skin (topical use), capsaicin helps relieve pain. Although pain may at first increase, it usually decreases after the first use. Capsaicin stimulates the release of a compound believed to be involved in communicating pain between the nerves in the spinal cord and other parts of the body. When you apply it to the skin, capsaicin may help relieve pain from: Pain disorders, including pain after surgery. In general, you use creams containing capsaicin for pain relief. You may feel a burning or itching sensation the first few times you use the cream, but this will gradually decrease with each use. Wash your hands thoroughly after each use to avoid getting the cream in your eyes or on other moist mucous membranes, where it can cause a burning sensation. When you eat hot peppers or take capsaicin as a dietary supplement, the capsaicin may improve your digestion by increasing the digestive fluids in the stomach and by fighting bacteria that could cause an infection. Experts in the United States generally consider capsaicin to be safe. If you are just beginning to use capsaicin, either as fresh or prepared food or in powder form, start with small amounts. If you use a topical cream, you should first apply it to a small area of skin to test for an allergic reaction. Do not take capsaicin if you have high blood pressure or are already being treated for high blood pressure. To reduce the burning sensation, remove the seeds from the peppers before you eat or cook with them. Also, if you eat bananas along with the peppers, you may reduce the burning sensation. Extremely high intake of capsaicin may cause ulcers, but it's rare for anyone to consume enough for this to be a problem. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate dietary supplements in the same way it regulates medicines. Always tell your doctor if you are using a dietary supplement or if you are thinking about combining a dietary supplement with your conventional medical treatment. It may not be safe to forgo your conventional medical treatment and rely only on a dietary supplement. When using dietary supplements, keep in mind the following: Like conventional medicines, dietary supplements may cause side effects, trigger allergic reactions, or interact with prescription and nonprescription medicines or other supplements you might be taking. A side effect or interaction with another medicine or supplement may make other health conditions worse. Because of this, how well they work or any side effects they cause may differ among brands or even within different lots of the same brand. The form of supplement that you buy in health food or grocery stores may not be the same as the form used in research. Other than for vitamins and minerals, the long-term effects of most dietary supplements are not known."], [1655, "Canker Sores", "Canker sores are small, shallow ulcers that appear in the mouth and often make eating and talking uncomfortable. These may appear three or four times a year and last up to a week. Stress or tissue injury is thought to be the cause of simple canker sores. Certain foods -- including citrus or acidic fruits and vegetables (such as lemons, oranges, pineapples, apples, figs, tomatoes, and strawberries) -- can trigger a canker sore or make the problem worse. Sometimes a sharp tooth surface or dental appliance, such as braces or ill-fitting dentures, might also trigger canker sores. Although cold sores and canker sores are often confused with each other, they are not the same. Cold sores, also called fever blisters or herpes simplex type 1, are groups of painful, fluid-filled blisters. Unlike canker sores, cold sores are caused by a virus and are extremely contagious. You may have a canker sore if you have: A painful sore or sores inside your mouth -- on the tongue, on the soft palate (the back portion of the roof of your mouth), or inside your cheeks A tingling or burning sensation before the sores appear Sores in your mouth that are round, white or gray, with a red edge or border In severe canker sore attacks, you may also experience: Fever Physical sluggishness Swollen lymph nodes Pain from a canker sore generally lessens in a few days, and the sores usually heal without treatment in about a week or two. Although there is no cure for canker sores, and they often recur, you may be able to reduce their frequency by: Avoiding foods that irritate your mouth, including citrus fruits, acidic vegetables, and spicy foods Avoiding irritation from gum chewing Brushing with a soft-bristled brush after meals and flossing daily, which will keep your mouth free of foods that might trigger a sore You should call your dentist about canker sores if you have: Unusually large sores Sores that are spreading Sores that last 3 weeks or longer Intolerable pain despite avoiding trigger foods and taking over-the-counter pain medication Difficulty drinking enough fluids A high fever with the appearance of the canker sores"], [1656, "Cancer Pain", "Cancer pain, or the discomfort that stems from cancer and its treatment, can be controlled most of the time. Cancer treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery also may cause pain. The amount of pain may depend on the type of cancer, the stage or extent of the disease, and the person's pain threshold (tolerance for pain). Mild to Moderate Pain Pain relievers: Acetaminophen (Anacin, Mapap, Panadol, Tylenol) and a group of pain relievers called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can treat mild to moderate pain. NSAIDs can interfere with blood clotting, cause gastrointestinal problems and may lead to increased risk of heart attack or stroke. Moderate to Severe Pain Narcotic pain relievers: These drugs include codeine, morphine (Kadian, MS Contin, Oromorph), hydrocodone (Lortab, Norco, Vicodin), hydromorphone (Dilaudid, Exalgo), fentanyl (Duragesic), and oxycodone (OxyContin). Narcotic pain relievers require a prescription and may be used along with mild pain relievers for moderate to severe pain. Tingling and Burning Pain Antidepressants: Certain antidepressants are used to relieve pain even if the person isn't depressed. Amitriptyline and nortriptyline (Pamelor) are antidepressants sometimes used to treat pain. Anticonvulsants (anti-seizure medications): Despite the name, anticonvulsants like gabapentin (Fanatrex, Gralise, Neurontin) and carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Equetro,Tegretol) are used not only for seizures, but also to control burning and tingling pain, painful symptoms of nerve damage. Other drugs: Corticosteroids such as prednisone (Sterapred) are used to lessen swelling, which often causes pain. Although cancer pain is usually treated with medicine, surgery to remove a tumor or radiation therapy to shrink a tumor can be used along with medicine to provide additional pain relief. In most cases, doctors treat cancer pain with pain-relief medicines called analgesics or with non-drug treatments such as physical therapy and rehabilitation, imagery, biofeedback and relaxation techniques."], [1657, "Campylobacteriosis", "Campylobacteriosis is food poisoning caused by the campylobacter bacterium.

Infants, young adults, and males are most likely to get the condition. Campylobacteriosis is usually caused by handling poultry (such as chicken or turkey) that is contaminated with the campylobacter bacterium and is raw or undercooked. For example, you can be infected by cutting poultry meat on a cutting board and then using the unwashed cutting board or utensil to prepare vegetables or other raw or lightly cooked foods. Drinking contaminated milk or water from contaminated lakes or streams can also result in infection. Some people have become infected through contact with the infected stool of a dog or cat. The symptoms of campylobacteriosis include diarrhea, cramping, stomach pain, and fever within 2 to 5 days after exposure to the bacteria. Your diarrhea may be bloody, and you may feel sick to your stomach and vomit. You treat campylobacteriosis by managing any complications until it passes. Dehydration caused by diarrhea and vomiting is the most common complication. Most people recover completely within a week after symptoms begin, although sometimes recovery can take up to 10 days. To prevent dehydration, take frequent sips of a rehydration drink (such as Pedialyte). Try to drink a cup of water or rehydration drink for each large, loose stool you have. Soda and fruit juices have too much sugar and not enough of the important electrolytes that are lost during diarrhea, and they should not be used to rehydrate. Try to stay with your normal diet as much as possible. But try to avoid foods that are high in fat and sugar. In more severe cases, your doctor may recommend antibiotics. In rare cases, long-term problems can result from campylobacteriosis. This occurs when your immune system attacks your nerves, which can lead to paralysis that lasts several weeks and usually requires that you go to a hospital. You can prevent campylobacteriosis by practicing safe food handling (adapted from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Bag raw meat, poultry, and fish separately from other food items. Young children can get sick from touching packaged poultry, so don't allow them to touch or play with packages of poultry in your grocery cart. Also wash them after using the bathroom or changing diapers. If possible, use two cutting boards-one for fresh produce and the other for raw meat, poultry, and seafood. Otherwise, be sure to wash the cutting board with hot, soapy water between each use. You can also wash your knives and cutting boards in the dishwasher to disinfect them. And be aware of the risk of food poisoning from raw fish (including sushi), clams, and oysters. If you are not sure whether a food is safe, don't eat it. Reheating food that is contaminated will not make it safe. It is important to pay particular attention to food preparation and storage during warm months when food is often served outside. Bacteria grow faster in warmer weather, so food can spoil more quickly and possibly cause illness. Do not leave food outdoors for more than 1 hour if the temperature is above 90degF (32degC), and never leave it outdoors for more than 2 hours."], [1658, "Camptodactyly-Cleft Palate-Clubfoot", "Gordon syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that belongs to a group of genetic disorders known as the distal arthrogryposes. These disorders typically involve stiffness and impaired mobility of certain joints of the lower arms and legs (distal extremities) including the knees, elbows, wrists, and/or ankles. Gordon syndrome is characterized by the permanent fixation of several fingers in a flexed position (camptodactyly), abnormal bending inward of the foot (clubfoot or talipes), and, less frequently, incomplete closure of the roof of the mouth (cleft palate).

Blisters can form when the skin is repeatedly rubbed; for instance, when your shoes rub the same spot on your foot, when you wear shoes that don't fit properly, or when you wear shoes without socks. Callus: A callus is a build-up of hard skin, usually on the underside of the foot. Calluses are caused by an uneven distribution of weight, generally on the bottom of the forefoot or heel. Calluses also can be caused by improperly fitting shoes or by a skin abnormality. Your health care provider may recommend you \"pop\" the blister with a sterile needle to allow the skin to re-attach. However, don't cut the skin away unless it is already torn and drying out. Gently wash the area with mild soap and water or a cleansing towel and then apply antibacterial cream to the blister.

From a young age, plaque can start to go into your blood vessel walls. That inflames the walls and raises the risk of blood clots and heart attacks. Then, other things, like inflammatory cells, lipoproteins, and calcium, travel in your bloodstream and mix with the plaque. As more of these inflammatory cells join in, along with cholesterol, the plaque increases, both pushing the artery walls outward and growing inward. Eventually, a narrowed coronary artery may develop new blood vessels that go around the blockage to get blood to the heart. However, if you're pushing yourself or stressed, the new arteries may not be able to bring enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle. If a blood vessel within the brain bursts, most likely as a result of uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure), a hemorrhagic stroke can result. Studies have found that taking low-dose aspirin each day may help prevent heart attacks and strokes in people who are 50 or older and at risk for heart disease. Cardiac ischemia is when plaque and fatty matter narrow the inside of an artery so much, it cannot supply enough oxygen-rich blood to your heart. This can cause heart attacks -- with or without chest pain and other symptoms. Ischemia happens most during: Exercise or other exertion Eating Excitement or stress Exposure to cold Coronary artery disease can get to a point where ischemia happens even when you're at rest. Ischemia can happen without warning in anyone with heart disease, although it is more common in people with diabetes. Angina can be described as a: Heaviness Pressure Aching Burning Numbness Fullness Squeezing Painful feeling It can be mistaken for indigestion or heartburn. Angina is usually felt in the chest, but may also be felt in the: Left shoulder Arms Neck Back Jaw Symptoms are often subtler in women. Nausea, sweating, fatigue, or shortness of breath can join the typical pressure-like chest pain. Other symptoms that can occur with coronary artery disease include: Shortness of breath Palpitations (irregular heartbeats, skipped beats, or a \"flip-flop\" feeling in your chest) A faster heartbeat Weakness or dizziness Nausea Sweating Your doctor can tell if you have coronary artery disease after: He learns your symptoms, medical history, and risk factors A physical exam. Diagnostic tests, including an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), echocardiogram, exercise stress tests, electron beam (ultrafast) CT scans, cardiac catheterization, and others. These tests help your doctor know the extent of your coronary heart disease, its effect on your heart, and the best treatment for you. If you've been diagnosed with coronary artery disease, you'll probably be on aspirin and a statin, if not other things. Surgery and other procedures: Common ones to treat coronary artery disease include: Balloon angioplasty Stent placement Coronary artery bypass surgery All of these boost blood supply to your heart, but they don't cure coronary heart disease. Doctors are also studying innovative ways to treat heart disease, including: Angiogenesis.

It's caused by pressure on your median nerve, which runs the length of the arm, goes through a passage in the wrist called the carpal tunnel, and ends in the hand. The median controls the movement and feeling of your thumb, and also the movement of all your fingers except your pinky. But it can happen due to: Repetitive motions, like typing or any motions of the wrist that you do over and over. This is especially true of actions when your hands are lower than your wrist. You may feel a burning, tingling, or itching numbness in the palm of your hand and thumb, or index and middle fingers. That usually happens in the evening because of the relaxed position of your hand and while sleeping. In the morning, you may wake up with numbness and tingling in your hands that may run all the way to your shoulder. As carpal tunnel syndrome becomes more severe, you may have less grip strength because the muscles in your hand shrink. The median nerve begins to lose function because of the irritation or pressure around it. This leads to: Slower nerve impulses Loss of feeling in the fingers A loss of strength and coordination, especially the ability to use your thumb to pinch You could end up with permanent muscle damage and lose function in your hand. Medical conditions sometimes linked to carpal tunnel syndrome include: Obesity Hypothyroidism Rheumatoid Arthritis Diabetes Pregnancy Trauma Women are three times more likely than men to get the condition. Certain jobs that involve repeating the same motion with your arm over a long time may raise your chances of getting the condition. Those jobs include: Assembly line worker Sewer or knitter Baker Cashier Hair stylist Musician Your doctor may ask you to tap the palm side of your wrist or fully flex your wrist with your arms completely extended. If your symptoms are due to repetitive motion, you can take more frequent breaks or do a bit less of the activity that's causing you pain. The doctor may have you use a splint to keep your wrist from moving and to lessen pressure on the nerves. You may wear one at night to help get rid of that numbness or tingling feeling. Your doctor may give you anti-inflammatory drugs or steroid shots to reduce swelling. If none of the above treatments work, an operation may be an option.

The stools may contain a large amount of fat and may stick to the sides of the toilet bowl, making them hard to flush. Children and adults often have the same types of symptoms. Adults and children may have unexplained weight loss despite having a normal appetite. Younger children may fail to gain weight and grow as expected.

It's found in the grains wheat, barley, rye, and triticale (a wheat-rye cross). When you have this disease and you eat food with gluten in it, the gluten triggers an immune response that is not normal. This damages the inside of your small intestine so that it can't do a good job of absorbing nutrients from your food. It's important to get treatment, because celiac disease can: Lead to anemia. In children, celiac disease can slow growth and weaken bones. If it isn't treated, your child can get very sick. Call a doctor if your child is losing a lot of weight, has diarrhea, or feels weak and tired for many days for no reason. You're more likely to have these genes and get celiac disease if a close family member has the disease. Symptoms of celiac disease include: Gas and bloating. Your doctor will ask questions about your symptoms and do a physical exam. To make sure you have celiac disease, you will probably have an endoscopy. In this test, a doctor uses a thin, lighted tube to look at the inside of your small intestine. Your doctor can also take small samples of tissue to be tested in a lab. Often celiac disease is mistaken for another problem such as food intolerance or irritable bowel syndrome. After your celiac disease diagnosis, your doctor may do more tests, such as blood tests to check for anemia. You may also have a bone density exam. These tests will help your doctor find out if you have other problems, such as osteoporosis, that can arise when you have celiac disease. To get and stay well, you need to avoid all foods that have gluten. For many people, this means changing everything about the way they eat. For help, work with a dietitian who has experience with gluten-free diets. Together you can find foods you like that don't have gluten. Avoid all foods made with wheat, rye, barley, or triticale. Don't drink any beer or ale. You can still eat eggs, meat, fish, fruit, and vegetables. Flours and foods made with amaranth, arrowroot, beans, buckwheat, corn, cornmeal, flax, millet, potatoes, pure uncontaminated nut and oat bran, quinoa, rice, sorghum, soybeans, tapioca, or teff are also okay. Within 2 weeks after starting a gluten-free eating plan, most people find that their symptoms start to get better. For a short time after your treatment starts, you might also need to stop drinking cow's milk and foods made with it. Most of the time, but not always, people can have these foods again after their intestine has healed. Some foods that are labeled \"wheat-free\" may still have gluten.

These tumors may begin to grow anywhere in the body but usually begin in organs such as the pineal gland in the brain, in the mediastinum, or in the abdomen. Extragonadal germ cell tumors can be benign (noncancer) or malignant (cancer). Benign extragonadal germ cell tumors are called benign teratomas. These are more common than malignant extragonadal germ cell tumors and often are very large. Malignant extragonadal germ cell tumors are divided into two types, nonseminoma and seminoma.

Malignant extragonadal germ cell tumors may cause signs and symptoms as they grow into nearby areas. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following: Chest pain. Imaging and blood tests are used to detect (find) and diagnose extragonadal germ cell tumors. The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. The testicles may be checked for lumps, swelling, or pain. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. Serum tumor marker test: A procedure in which a sample of blood is examined to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. The following three tumor markers are used to detect extragonadal germ cell tumor: Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (b-hCG).Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). A PET scan is a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. When a PET scan and CT scan are done at the same time, it is called a PET-CT. Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The type of biopsy used depends on where the extragonadal germ cell tumor is found. Excisional biopsy: The removal of an entire lump of tissue. Core biopsy: The removal of tissue using a wide needle.

When you have EPI, you don't get the nutrition you need because your body can't absorb fats and some vitamins and minerals from foods. You might lose weight or have pain in your belly. There are drugs that work for most people that give you a new supply of enzymes, so you can go back to digesting food the right way. Besides taking medicine, you can manage your symptoms by making sure you follow the right diet. Your doctor will recommend foods that will help you get enough nutrients and protein that you might be missing. Damage to your pancreas causes EPI. There are many reasons this can happen but some of the most common are: Your pancreas gets inflamed often. It happens when the enzymes made by the pancreas start working while they're still inside it, before they get to the small intestine. For instance, your pancreas could get inflamed if some passageways in it are blocked or if you have very high levels of triglycerides (a type of blood fat) or an immune system disorder. You have one of these inherited diseases: Cystic fibrosis Shwachman-Diamond syndrome If you have cystic fibrosis, your body makes unusually thick and sticky mucus. This mucus blocks passageways in your pancreas and stops enzymes from getting out. If you have Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, you may be missing cells in your pancreas that make enzymes. Crohn's disease and celiac disease can also lead to EPI in some people. But once your pancreas gets so damaged that it starts to hurt your ability to absorb fat, you may get some symptoms, such as: Pain or tenderness in your belly Bad-smelling bowel movements Diarrhea Gas Feeling full You might also lose weight and get other problems, because your body doesn't absorb enough vitamins. For instance, you could develop a bleeding disorder if you're not getting enough vitamin K. Or you could get bone pain if you don't get enough vitamin D. Your doctor may diagnose your condition by checking your symptoms. He may ask you questions such as: Do you have pain in your upper belly? Have you had bad-smelling bowel movements that are oily and hard to flush down the toilet? First, you may need some blood tests that check to see if you're getting enough vitamins and that your pancreas is making enough enzymes. Other blood tests can check for things that can lead to EPI, like celiac disease. You may also need to take the \"3-day fecal test.\" You'll need to collect samples of your stool in special containers for 3 days. Your doctor may also ask you to take a test called \"fecal elastase-1.\" For this, you also need to collect a sample of your bowel movement in a container. The test can tell you if your pancreas is making enough of it. You may also need to get some tests that check to see if your pancreas is inflamed, including: CT scan. It uses strong magnets and radio waves to make pictures of organs and structures inside your body. You may want to start by asking your doctor: What treatments do you recommend? You take prescription pills that replace the enzymes your pancreas isn't making. If you take them before you eat, the replacement enzymes may move through your stomach before your food gets there. You may also need to take an antacid to keep your stomach from breaking down pancreatic enzymes before they can start to work. There are six FDA-approved pancreatic enzyme products that are only available by prescription: Creon Pancreaze Pertzye Ultresa Viokace Zenpep You may also need medicine to treat pain. If this doesn't bring you relief, your doctor may prescribe stronger pain drugs, such as hydrocodone and oxycodone. Alcohol can make it even harder for your body to absorb fat, and can damage your pancreas over time. You may need to take vitamins A, D, E, and K to replace ones that aren't getting absorbed from your diet. One of your big challenges is to make sure you don't lose weight. A nutritionist can help you choose foods that have enough protein and nutrients. Also, talk with your family and friends to get the support you need while you're getting treatment.

The stiffness, pain, and swelling associated with arthritis can severely reduce the range of motion of joints (the distance joints can move in certain directions). Avoiding physical activity because of pain or discomfort also can lead to significant muscle loss and excessive weight gain. Exercise, as part of a comprehensive arthritis treatment plan, can improve joint mobility, muscle strength, and overall physical conditioning, and help you maintain a healthy weight. A tailored program that includes a balance of three types of exercises -- range-of-motion, strengthening, and endurance -- can relieve the symptoms of arthritis and protect joints from further damage. Exercise also may: Help maintain normal joint movement Increase muscle flexibility and strength Help maintain weight to reduce pressure on joints Help keep bone and cartilage tissue strong and healthy Improve endurance and cardiovascular fitness To help relieve pain, people with arthritis often keep their affected joints bent -- especially those in the knees, hands, and fingers -- because it's more comfortable in that position. Although this may temporarily relieve discomfort, holding a joint in the same position for too long can cause permanent loss of mobility and further hinder the ability to perform daily activities. Range-of-motion exercises (also called stretching or flexibility exercises) help maintain normal joint function by increasing and preserving joint mobility and flexibility. In this group of exercises, gently straightening and bending the joints in a controlled manner as far as they comfortably will go can help condition the affected joints. During the course of a range-of-motion exercise program, the joints are stretched progressively farther until normal or near-normal range is achieved and maintained. In addition to preserving joint function, range-of-motion exercises are an important form of warm-up and stretching, and should be done prior to performing strengthening or endurance exercises, or engaging in any other physical activity. There are several types of strengthening exercises that, when performed properly, can maintain or increase muscle tissue to support your muscles without aggravating your joints. However, a group of exercises called \"isometrics\" will help strengthen muscles without bending painful joints. However, this group of exercises is more intensive, achieving strength development through increased repetitions or by introducing increasing weight resistance such as with with small dumbbells or stretch bands. A physical therapist or fitness instructor (preferably one who has experience working with people with arthritis) can tell you how to safely and effectively perform isometric and isotonic exercises. Aqua therapy may be easier on joints because the buoyancy of water takes some of the weight off the painful joints while providing resistance training. The foundation of endurance training is aerobic exercise, which includes any activity that increases the heart rate for a prolonged period of time. Aerobic activity conditions the heart and lungs to: Use oxygen to more efficiently supply the entire body with larger amounts of oxygen-rich blood Build stronger muscles for endurance activity When paired with a healthy diet, aerobic activity also is fundamental for controlling weight (which is important for people with arthritis since it reduces excess pressure on affected joints) and for improving overall general health. Aerobic exercise should be performed at a comfortable, steady pace that allows you to talk normally and easily during the activity. To improve your body's aerobic condition, you should calculate your maximum heart rate -- 220 minus your age -- and exercise at a level of intensity between 60% and 80% of your maximum heart rate. Walking is one of the easiest aerobic exercises to begin because it requires no special skills or equipment other than a good pair of supportive walking shoes, and it's less stressful on joints than running or jogging. Biking is another good choice for people with arthritis, because it places less stress on knee, foot, and ankle joints. These activities are best preceded by a program of range-of-motion and strength exercises to reduce the chance of injury. People with arthritis who are beginning a new exercise program should spend some time conditioning with a program that consists of only range-of-motion and strengthening exercises, depending on their physical condition and level of fitness. Check with your doctor and adjust your program if you experience any of the following: Unusual or persistent fatigue Sharp or increased pain Increased weakness Decreased range of motion Increased joint swelling Continuing pain Regardless of the exercise program you select, it's important to begin slowly and choose a program you enjoy so that you maintain it."], [1716, "Exercising for a Healthy Heart", "When you have heart disease or you've had heart surgery, exercise is an important part of keeping your condition under control. Your doctor can let you know what activities are OK. You may have more options than you think. Ask your doctor about things like pushups and situps. Make sure that lifting and pushing heavy objects, and chores like raking, shoveling, mowing, and scrubbing, aren't off limits. Your doctor can let you know if you need to change your exercise plans. Don't do too much, too soon. Don't exercise outdoors when it is too cold, hot, or humid. Extreme temperatures can interfere with circulation, make breathing difficult, and cause chest pain. Drink water even before you feel thirsty, especially on hot days. If you must walk in steep areas, slow down going uphill to avoid working too hard. Monitor your heart rate closely, and talk to your doctor about what a safe heart rate is for you. If you have to stop, go back slowly. If your exercise program gets interrupted for a few days (due to illness, vacation, or bad weather, for example), ease back into the routine. Stop an exercise if you get too tired or short of breath. Tell your doctor about it, or schedule an appointment. Don't exercise if you're not feeling well or have a fever. Stop activity if you get a rapid or irregular heartbeat or have heart palpitations. Check your pulse after you've rested for 15 minutes. If it's still more than 100-120 beats per minute, call the doctor. If you feel pain while exercising, don't ignore it. Stop and rest if you: Feel weak Are dizzy or light-headed Have unexplained weight gain or swelling -- call the doctor right away Feel pressure or pain in your chest, neck, arm, jaw, or shoulder Are concerned for any reason Call the doctor if those feelings don't go away."], [1717, "Exercises for Patellar Tracking Disorder", "Nonsurgical treatment may include rest, regular stretching and strengthening exercises, taping or bracing the knee, using ice, and short-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Quadriceps strengthening is the most commonly prescribed treatment for patellar tracking disorder. Exercises to increase flexibility and to strengthen the muscles around the hip can also help. Sit with your leg straight and supported on the floor or a firm bed. (If you feel discomfort in the front or back of your knee, place a small towel roll under your knee.) Tighten the muscles on top of your thigh by pressing the back of your knee flat down to the floor. (If you feel discomfort under your kneecap, place a small towel roll under your knee.) Hold for about 6 seconds, then rest up to 10 seconds. Lean against the wall and slide down until your knees are bent about 20 to 30 degrees. Place a ball about the size of a soccer ball between your knees and squeeze your knees against the ball for about 6 seconds at a time. Lie on your back with your good knee bent so that your foot rests flat on the floor. You should be able to slip your flat hand in between the floor and the small of your back, with your palm touching the floor and your back touching the back of your hand. Tighten the thigh muscles in the injured leg by pressing the back of your knee flat down to the floor. Tighten the quadriceps muscles of your straight leg and lift the leg 12 to 18 inches off the floor. Hold for about 6 seconds, then slowly lower the leg back down and rest a few seconds.

Hold for about 6 seconds, slowly lower the leg back down, and rest a few seconds. Stand with your hands lightly resting on a counter or chair in front of you. Make sure your knees do not go in front of your toes. Stand on a step, on the leg you want to exercise. Keeping your head up and your back straight, lean slightly forward. Slowly bend your knee so the foot hanging down moves down toward the floor, then slowly straighten your knee again. Your heel should stay on the step, and your knee should not go any farther forward than your toe. Bend the knee of the leg you want to stretch, and grab the front of your foot with the hand on the same side. For example, if you are stretching your right leg, use your right hand. Keeping your knees next to each other, pull your foot toward your buttock until you feel a gentle stretch across the front of your hip and down the front of your thigh. Hold the stretch for at least 15 to 30 seconds. Put the leg you want to stretch up on the wall, and straighten your knee to feel a gentle stretch at the back of your leg. Hold the stretch for at least 15 to 30 seconds. Lie on your back with both knees bent and your feet on the floor. Put the ankle of the leg you are going to stretch on your opposite thigh near your knee. Push gently on the knee of the leg you are stretching until you feel a gentle stretch around your hip.

He or she may ask that you do specific exercises and will help you figure out not only how often and how long to do your exercises but also how to set your long-term exercise program goals. Although it may take weeks before you are able to reach your goals, how long it takes is not as important as doing the exercises consistently. For each exercise, either time how long you can do it or count the number of times you can do it before you are mildly out of breath. Then rest and move on to the next exercise. Each week, increase the time you spend doing each exercise or how many times you do each one. Pay attention to your breathing. Try to breathe slowly to save your breath.

Ewing sarcoma is a type of tumor that forms from a certain kind of cell in bone or soft tissue. Askin tumor (Ewing sarcoma of the chest wall). Ewing sarcoma also may be found in the soft tissue of the trunk, arms, legs, head and neck, abdominal cavity, or other areas. Check with your child's doctor if you see any of the following in your child: Pain and/or swelling, usually in the arms, legs, chest, back, or pelvis (area between the hips). A lump (which may feel soft and warm) in the arms, legs, chest, or pelvis. The following tests and procedures may be used to diagnose or stage Ewing sarcoma: Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the area where the tumor formed. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the area where the tumor formed, taken from different angles. PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. A PET scan and a CT scan are often done at the same time. Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy: The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone. A pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to see if the cancer has spread. X-ray: An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body, such as the chest or the area where the tumor formed. Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells. The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells. The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells. Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that makes it. Tissue samples are removed during an incisional or needle biopsy so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. Needle biopsy: For a needle biopsy, tissue is removed using a needle. Incisional biopsy: For an incisional biopsy, a sample of tissue is removed through an incision in the skin. For an incisional or excisional biopsy, the specialists (pathologist, radiation oncologist, and surgeon) who will treat the patient usually work together to decide where the incision should be made. If there is a chance that the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, one or more lymph nodes may be removed and checked for signs of cancer. The following tests may be done on the tissue that is removed: Cytogeneticanalysis: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes. Immunohistochemistry: A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. Flow cytometry: A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample, the percentage of live cells in a sample, and certain characteristics of cells, such as size, shape, and the presence of tumor markers on the cell surface. The cells are stained with a light-sensitive dye, placed in a fluid, and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light. Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on certain factors before and after treatment. After treatment, prognosis is affected by: Whether the tumor was completely removed by surgery. Treatment options depend on the following: Where the tumor is found in the body and how large the tumor is."], [1720, "Esophageal Aperistalsis", "Achalasia is a rare disorder of the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach.

Salmon patches (called a ''stork bite'' at the back of the neck or an ''angel's kiss'' between the eyes) are simple nests of blood vessels (probably caused by maternal hormones) that fade on their own after a few weeks or months. Jaundice is a yellow coloration on baby's skin and eyes. If the bilirubin level becomes sufficiently high, blue or white lights may be focused on the baby's skin to lower the level, because excess bilirubin can sometimes pose a health hazard. They are flat, gray-blue in color (almost looking like a bruise), and can be small or large. They are caused by some pigment that didn't make it to the top layer when baby's skin was being formed. New rashes may appear in babies after a few days, weeks, or even months. Greasy, yellowish crusts appear on the scalp and may include a red, irritating rash on the face, behind the ears, on the neck, and even in the armpits. Eczema is red, itchy patches on the skin, often seen on the baby's chest, arms, legs, face, elbows, and behind the knees. It is caused by dry, sensitive skin, and sometimes allergies (although it can be difficult at this age to know what the trigger might be). Your doctor can determine if the rash looks like eczema and prescribe the appropriate treatment. In general, treatment consists of: Using a very gentle soapUsing a gentle detergent and no fabric softener in baby's laundryUsing skin moisturizersApplying a steroid cream (like hydrocortisone or even a stronger one) if the eczema won't go away Using a very gentle soap Using a gentle detergent and no fabric softener in baby's laundry Using skin moisturizers Applying a steroid cream (like hydrocortisone or even a stronger one) if the eczema won't go away Prickly heat looks like small red bumps, mostly on areas of your baby's body that tend to overheat and sweat, like the neck, diaper area, and armpits. A fungal infection(candidiasis) can show up in different ways on your baby. In the diaper area, candidiasis looks like an intense red rash, often with smaller bumps around the edges. A fungal infection loves moist, dark areas, so you'll find redness due to it in the creases of the thighs. Candidiasis is treated with antifungal oral gel or liquid medicine (for oral thrush) or antifungal cream (for the diaper area), or both. In the first few months of a baby's life, any rash associated with other symptoms (such as fever, poor feeding, lethargy, or cough) needs to be evaluated by a doctor as soon as possible. While most rashes are not serious, a few need very close attention: Fluid-filled blisters (especially ones with opaque, yellowish fluid) can indicate a serious infection, like a bacterial infection or herpes.

Even though Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) isn't a household name, you've probably been infected without knowing it. Once you're infected with EBV, symptoms can take 4 to 6 weeks to show up. If you do get symptoms, most likely you'll have: Fatigue Fever Lack of appetite Rash Sore throat Swollen glands in the neck Weakness and sore muscles Although you should start feeling better in 2 to 4 weeks, the fatigue can stick around much longer. The virus is found in saliva, so you can catch mono from kissing someone who's infected. You can also get it from drinking from the same glass or using an infected person's toothbrush. It's also found in blood and semen, so it's possible to get mono from sex, a blood transfusion, or an organ transplant. The virus can become active again months or years later, making you contagious once more. Fever, fatigue, and sore throat could also be signs of other illnesses, like the flu or a cold. Your doctor will also check to see if you have a swollen liver and white patches on your tonsils. One test looks for antibodies, substances your immune system makes in response to the EBV virus. Another test looks for a type of white blood cell your body uses to fight off the EBV infection. Although no medicine can cure an EBV infection, you can take these steps at home to ease your symptoms: Get plenty of rest. Drink a lot of water and other liquids to stay hydrated. (Don't give aspirin to children under 19 years of age because of the risk of a rare but serious condition called Reye's syndrome.) For a month or so, avoid sports, heavy lifting, or other vigorous activities in which you could injure your spleen. The best way to avoid catching it is to stay away from anyone who has mono. Don't share any items, including glasses, silverware, and toothbrushes, with someone who is infected. There are some rare complications of mono, so see your doctor if you or your child has any of these symptoms: Sudden, sharp pain on the left side of the belly, which could mean a problem with your spleen Very little urine, a sign of dehydration Trouble breathing or swallowing -- call 911 immediately Also call if your symptoms don't go away after 4 to 6 weeks.

Nerves: They carry visual information from your eyes to your brain. Eyelids: Outside coverings that protect and spread moisture over your eyes. Blepharitis: An inflammation or infection of the eyelid Conjunctivitis (pinkeye): This is inflammation of the conjunctiva. Blood vessels in the conjunctiva swell. This makes the part of your eye that's usually white look red. Corneal abrasions: That's the official name for a scratch on this part of your eye. It should get better in a couple of days without further problems. Corneal infections (keratitis): An inflamed or infected cornea is sometimes caused by a bacterial or viral infection. You may be more likely to get it if you leave your contacts in overnight or wear dirty lenses. Foreign bodies: Something in your eye, like a bit of dirt, can irritate it. Glaucoma: This family of conditions causes fluid to build up in your eye. But a type called acute angle-closure glaucoma causes pressure inside your eye to rise suddenly. Symptoms include severe eye pain, nausea and vomiting, headache, and worsening vision. Iritis or uveitis: An inflammation inside your eye from trauma, infections, or problems with your immune system. Symptoms include pain, red eye, and, often, worse vision. Optic neuritis: An inflammation of the nerve that travels from the back of the eyeball into your brain. Symptoms include loss of vision and sometimes deep discomfort when you look from side to side. When pressure builds up behind your eyes, it can cause pain on one or both sides. You may hear your doctor call it a chalazion or hordeolum.

Other symptoms along with sore eyes can be a clue to what is causing the pain. See your eye doctor if you have eye pain, especially if you have less vision, headache, or nausea and vomiting. Eye doctors use a variety of tools to diagnose eye pain: A slit-lamp exam uses bright light to look at all the structures of your eye. Dilating drops expand your pupil to let the doctor see deep into your eye. A tonometer is a tool that measures eye pressure. They target the specific cause of eye pain. Antihistamines in the form of eyedrops, a pill, or a syrup can improve conjunctivitis from allergies. Iritis: The doctor will treat this with steroid, antibiotic, or antiviral eyedrops.

If you want to do something for the person, focus on keeping them safe. The type of seizure most people will think of is the generalized tonic-clonic seizure, better known as a grand mal seizure. They're frightening to watch, and someone who has one rarely knows or remembers what's happening. These seizures follow a pattern: The person seems to \"check out.\" They won't react if you wave a hand in their face or shake them. Their muscles clench and they become as rigid as a board. Next comes a series of jerking movements. Eventually, the jerking stops and they're alert and can talk again, but they may be dazed or unsteady for a little while. Any generalized seizure can be dangerous because the person is unaware of their surroundings and can't protect themselves from harm. The uncontrolled thrashing raises their chances of getting hurt. They're less intense and usually last no more than a minute or two. Part of their body, like an arm, might get stiff or go floppy. The person could zone out or stare at nothing. For someone having a generalized tonic-clonic seizure: Give them room. Clear hard or sharp objects, like glasses and furniture, away. Contrary to popular myth, you can't swallow your tongue during a seizure. Look at your watch at the start of the seizure, so you can time its length. For milder seizures, like a bit of staring or shaking arms or legs, guide the person away from hazards, including traffic, stairs, and water. Don't leave someone who's had a seizure alone. Reassure them and explain what they missed if they're confused or frightened. Get medical help when: It's a child's first seizure. The seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes.

Pain, tenderness, and swelling in the scrotum (epididymides or testicles) that gradually get worse are the most common symptoms of epididymitis. Other symptoms may include fever and chills, frequent or painful urination, or a discharge from the penis. A culture of discharge from the penis is done to check for a bacterial infection, such as a sexually transmitted infection. And a urinalysis and urine culture are done to check for a urinary tract infection. You may also have a blood test to check for an elevated white cell count and an ultrasound or nuclear medicine test to make sure that you do not have torsion of the testicle, an emergency condition that causes loss of blood flow to the testicles and requires urgent surgical treatment. Supportive measures, such as bed rest with elevation of the hips and anti-inflammatory medicines (such as ibuprofen or ketoprofen), may help relieve discomfort caused by epididymitis.

It happens a lot with runners and people who have flat feet, high arches, are overweight, or who are on their feet a lot. It can take 6-12 months for your foot to get back to normal. To make an ice pack, wrap a towel around a plastic bag filled with crushed ice or around a package of frozen corn or peas. Put it on your heel 3 to 4 times a day for 15 to 20 minutes at a time. Or you can fill a shallow pan with water and ice and soak your heel in it for 10 to 15 minutes a few times a day. Be sure to keep your toes out of the water. Another option is to fill a small paper or foam cup with water and freeze it. Pain relievers: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can make your foot feel better and help with inflammation. Stretching and exercise: Stretch your calves, Achilles tendon, and the bottom of your foot. Do exercises that make your lower leg and foot muscles stronger. This can help stabilize your ankle, ease pain, and keep plantar fasciitis from coming back. Athletic tape: Tape can support your foot and keep you from moving it in a way that makes plantar fasciitis worse. Also called insoles, arch supports, or orthotics, they can give you extra cushion and added support. Typically, your results will be just as good, and cheaper, with OTC inserts. When you choose one, firmer is better -- and make sure it has good arch support. You might also see advertisements for magnetic insoles to help with plantar fasciitis. With each step you take, your heel pounds the ground and puts tension on your plantar fascia. They raise your heel to relieve tension and give you extra cushion. Most of us sleep with our feet pointed down, which shortens the plantar fascia and Achilles tendon. So instead of shortening your plantar fascia, you get a good, constant stretch while you sleep. The cast or CAM walker forces you to rest your foot, which can help relieve pain. Once your foot feels better, you can make a few lifestyle changes to help keep plantar fasciitis from coming back. If you're overweight or obese, you may put more pressure on the bottom of your feet. This includes your first few steps when you get up in the morning. It's common to feel plantar fasciitis then. Activities like swimming or cycling won't cause plantar fasciitis or make it worse. For instance, curl and relax your toes and make circles with your feet and ankles. These include running and jumping, which put a lot of stress on your feet and can make your calf muscles tighter if you don't stretch them out. Keep doing your leg and foot stretches. Step one foot behind the other, keeping both feet parallel to each other. Gently lean toward the wall, keeping your back heel on the ground. Hold for 10 seconds, and then switch feet. Sit down and cross one foot over your other leg. Hold your toes and gently bend them backward.

Diamond-Blackfan anemia, or DBA, is a type of anemia that's caused when your bone marrow can't make enough red blood cells to meet your body's needs. It's caused by changes, or mutations, in their genes, which are the building blocks of DNA. About half of DBA cases have a known genetic cause, but some people don't know what causes their DBA. People with DBA have many of the same symptoms as other types of anemia, including fatigue, pale skin, and weakness. Some children born with DBA also have physical effects to their face and body, such as: A small head Wide eyes and a flat nose Small, low ears Small bottom jaw Short, webbed neck Small shoulder blades Abnormal thumbs Cleft palate or lip Other symptoms of DBA can include kidney problems, heart defects, and eye problems such as cataracts and glaucoma. Boys can also have hypospadias, a defect that is there from birth, where the opening for their urinary tract isn't at the tip of their penis. Your doctor can use several tests to find out if your child has DBA, usually before age 1. Children with DBA have a low number of red blood cells, but normal white blood cells and platelets. Your doctor will likely take a complete blood count, or CBC. It's a blood test that looks at different parts of blood. This test measures several things, including: The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets A protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen, called hemoglobin The amount of space the red blood cells take up in blood, or hematocrit The size of the red blood cells A few other blood tests your doctor can use to help diagnose DBA include: Reticulocyte count. About 80% of people with DBA have high levels of an enzyme called adenosine deaminase. Many children with DBA still have high levels of fetal hemoglobin, even as they get older. During this test, a small amount of cells and fluid are removed from the bone marrow with a needle. A technician looks at the samples to see how many red blood cells and other cells are in the marrow, and how healthy they are. Children with DBA will have fewer than normal healthy red blood cells in their bone marrow. These tests check for DBA genes, or genes for other types of anemia that are passed from parents to children. People with DBA are more likely to end up with certain diseases and conditions, including cancer of the blood and bone marrow (acute myeloid leukemia), bone cancer (osteosarcoma), and other disorders in which the bone marrow doesn't make enough healthy blood cells (myelodysplastic syndrome). Children diagnosed with DBA are able to live long lives with medical treatment. And some go into complete remission, meaning the symptoms disappear for a time. Some people might also consider a bone marrow transplant, although it is riskier. If steroid drugs don't work, or your child's anemia becomes more severe, a blood transfusion is an option.

Postmenopausal women have a high risk for endometrial cancer if they: Got their first period early Went through menopause late Are obese Have diabetes or high blood pressure Have few or no children Have a history of infertility, irregular periods, or abnormal cells in the endometrium (called endometrial hyperplasia) Have a family history of endometrial, colorectal, or breast cancer Women taking the drug tamoxifen to treat or prevent breast cancer have a slightly higher risk of endometrial cancer. But women who have taken birth control pills are only half as likely to have endometrial cancer after menopause. Women who take estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy have a higher risk of developing endometrial cancer. High-fat diets, especially containing red meat, can increase the risk of cancer, including endometrial and colon cancer.

Although it can occur in anyone, it is much more common in people with certain heart conditions and in those who've had it before. In 2007, the American Heart Association Endocarditis Committee -- together with other experts -- issued guidelines to help prevent endocarditis. After reviewing published studies, the committee found that only a small number of cases of infective endocarditis might be prevented by antibiotics for dental procedures. In patients with heart conditions associated with the highest risk of serious complications from endocarditis, it says that antibiotic treatment before dental procedures involving manipulation of the gums seems reasonable. In very rare cases, bacteria in the mouth may trigger endocarditis in people at higher risk. The gums become inflamed (red and swollen) and often bleed during tooth brushing, flossing, or certain dental procedures involving manipulation of the gums. Because this is so rare, the new guidelines suggest antibiotics prior to dental procedures only for patients who are at highest risk for serious complications from endocarditis. In fact, in most cases, the risk of problems from antibiotics exceeds the benefits from preventive antibiotics. To prevent endocarditis, patients with certain heart conditions receive a single dose of an antibiotic. The American Heart Association and American Dental Association now suggest that you receive antibiotics prior to dental treatment only if you have: Had bacterial endocarditis before A prosthetic (artificial) cardiac valve or prosthetic material used in valve repair Cardiac valve disease and have had a cardiac transplant Congenital (present at birth) heart disease. This includes only people with the following: Unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease (including those with devices that relieve symptoms only)Completely repaired congenital heart defect with prosthetic material or device during the first six months after the procedureRepaired congenital heart disease with defects that remain at or near the site of a prosthetic patch or prosthetic device Unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease (including those with devices that relieve symptoms only) Completely repaired congenital heart defect with prosthetic material or device during the first six months after the procedure Repaired congenital heart disease with defects that remain at or near the site of a prosthetic patch or prosthetic device The new guidelines suggest preventive treatment for all patients with cardiac conditions listed above, but not for all dental procedures. The guidelines suggest treatment only: During dental procedures that involve manipulation of gingival tissue (around bone and teeth) or the periapical region of teeth (tip of the tooth root) When the inside lining of the mouth is perforated The guidelines do not recommend antibiotics for these dental procedures or events: Routine anesthetic injections through noninfected tissue Dental X-rays Placement of removable prosthodontic or orthodontic appliances Adjustment of orthodontic appliances Placement of orthodontic brackets Shedding of baby teeth Bleeding from trauma to the lips or inside of the mouth Tell your dentist if your health has changed since your last visit. Be sure to let your dentist know if you've had heart or vascular surgery within the past six months. Make sure your dentist has a complete list of the names and dosages of your medications, both prescription and over-the-counter. Good oral and dental health is very important for patients at risk for endocarditis. Possible symptoms of endocarditis include: Unexplained fever Night chills Weakness, muscle pain, or joint pain Sluggishness (lethargy) or malaise (general ill feeling) Keep in mind that receiving antibiotics greatly lowers the risk of endocarditis. Also keep in mind that most cases of procedure-related endocarditis occur within two weeks of the procedure."], [1738, "Endocarditis", "Endocarditis is an infection of the heart's valves or inner lining. If it isn't treated, endocarditis can be deadly. Your risk is higher if you have a problem that affects blood flow through your heart . That's because a blood flow problem makes it more likely that bacteria or fungi will attach to heart tissue. Some other things raise your risk too, because they can let bacteria or fungi enter your bloodstream. You have a higher risk of endocarditis if you have: Had endocarditis in the past. An implanted heart device such as a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Abnormal or damaged heart valves or an artificial heart valve. Not all heart problems put you at higher risk for endocarditis. You do not have a higher risk if you have had: Bypass surgery for heart disease. Symptoms may appear quickly, within a few days of infection. See your doctor if you have symptoms like these that don't go away, especially if you are at risk for endocarditis. If endocarditis isn't treated soon, it can lead to more serious problems, such as: Heart failure. Heart rhythm problems. Heart attack or stroke. Infections in other organs, such as the lungs, brain, or kidneys. First, your doctor will ask about your medical history and your symptoms. These signs include a heart murmur, an enlarged spleen, and bleeding under the nails. Your doctor may also do tests, such as: Blood cultures. This is done to check your heart for problems such as infected areas or heart valve defects. This test checks for heart rhythm problems. This is to see if your heart is enlarged or if you have signs of heart failure. You will probably need several weeks of treatment. The antibiotics must be given long enough and at a strong enough dose to destroy all of the bacteria. After your fever is gone and you are stable, you may be able to continue IV antibiotics at home. After you have been treated with IV antibiotics, your doctor may want you to take antibiotic pills. If so, take them exactly as prescribed until they are gone. If your symptoms come back, call your doctor right away. You probably will need more antibiotics if testing shows that the bacteria were not completely destroyed. Some people who have endocarditis need surgery to repair or replace a heart valve or to prevent complications. Heart valve problems after a heart transplant. If you have any of these heart problems, you may need to take antibiotics before you have some kinds of dental work, surgery, or medical procedures.

Valves (e.g., mitral and tricuspid) connect the atria (left and right) to their respective ventricles. The left ventricle sends the now oxygen-filled blood into the main artery of the body (aorta). The parts of the heart described above are formed from an embryonic structure called the endocardial cushions. They may include a hole in the atrial septum, a hole in the ventricular septum, and/or abnormalities of the mitral and triscupid valves. ASVD may be classified as one of three forms: an incomplete (or partial) ASVD (atrial septal defect primum); a transitional form (atrial septal defect and small ventricular septal defect); or a more severe or complete form (large atrial and ventricular defects).

The neural tube is a narrow channel in the developing fetus that allows the brain and spinal cord to develop. The neural tube folds and closes early during pregnancy (third or fourth week) to complete the formation of the brain and spinal cord. A neural tube defect occurs when the neural tube does not close completely, which can occur anywhere along the head, neck or spine. The lack of proper closing of the neural tube can lead to a herniation process which appears as a pedunculated (having a stalk-like base) or sessile (attached directly to its base without a stalk) cystic lesion protruding through a defect in the cranial vault referred as encephalocele.

The most appropriate treatment and the patient's chance of recovery depend on the virus involved and the severity of the inflammation. In para-infectious encephalitis, the brain and spinal cord become inflamed within one to two weeks of contracting a viral or bacterial infection. Viral encephalitis may develop during or after infection with any of several viral illnesses including influenza, herpes simplex, measles, mumps, rubella, rabies, chickenpox, and arbovirus infection including West Nile virus. Herpes simplex type 1 virus is one of the more common and serious causes of viral encephalitis. Herpes-related encephalitis can erupt rapidly, and may cause seizures or mental changes and even lead to coma or death. It occurs when the herpes simplex type 1 virus travels to the brain rather than moving through the body to the surface of the skin and producing its more common symptom, a cold sore. Unlike herpes, arboviral infections are seasonal, occurring primarily in summer and early fall, and are clustered in specific regions, such as in the case of St. Louis encephalitis. In rare instances, bacterial, fungal, parasitic, or rickettsial infections cause encephalitis."], [1745, "Epilepsy Understanding Seizures and Epilepsy", "Seizures, abnormal movements or behavior due to unusual electrical activity in the brain, are a symptom of epilepsy. Non-epileptic seizures (called pseudoseizures) are not accompanied by abnormal electrical activity in the brain and may be caused by psychological issues or stress. Normal EEG readings and lack of response to epileptic drugs are two clues they are not true epileptic seizures. Provoked seizures are single seizures that may occur as the result of trauma, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), low blood sodium, high fever, or alcohol or drug abuse. Fever-related (or febrile) seizures may occur during infancy but are usually outgrown by age 6. After a careful evaluation to estimate the risk of recurrence, patients who suffer a single seizure may not need treatment. In the United States, about 2.5 million people have epilepsy and about 9% of Americans will have at least one seizure in their lifetimes. Epilepsy occurs as a result of abnormal electrical activity originating in the brain. In epilepsy, these electrical signals become abnormal, giving rise to an \"electrical storm\" that produces seizures. These storms may be within a specific part of the brain or be generalized, depending on the type of epilepsy. Therefore, it is essential that your neurologist diagnose your type of epilepsy, not just the type(s) of seizure you are having. In certain cases in which medications and diet are not working, surgery may be used. The type of treatment prescribed will depend on several factors, including the frequency and severity of the seizures, as well as the person's age, overall health, and medical history. Educational, social, and psychological treatment are all part of the total treatment plan for epilepsy.

It is caused by damage to the lungs over many years, usually from smoking. In chronic bronchitis, the airways that carry air to the lungs (bronchial tubes ) get inflamed and make a lot of mucus. In a healthy person, the tiny air sacs in the lungs are like balloons. As you breathe in and out, they get bigger and smaller to move air through your lungs. But with emphysema, these air sacs are damaged and lose their stretch. Less air gets in and out of the lungs, which makes you feel short of breath. You can't undo the damage to your lungs. But you can take steps to prevent more damage and to feel better. COPD is almost always caused by smoking. Over time, breathing tobacco smoke irritates the airways and destroys the stretchy fibers in the lungs. Secondhand smoke also may damage the lungs. It usually takes many years for the lung damage to start causing symptoms, so COPD is most common in people who are older than 60. You may be more likely to get COPD if you had a lot of serious lung infections when you were a child. People who get emphysema in their 30s or 40s may have a disorder that runs in families, called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The main symptoms are: A long-lasting (chronic) cough. It gets harder to eat or exercise, and breathing takes much more energy. At times, your symptoms may suddenly flare up and get much worse. This is called a COPD exacerbation (say \"egg-ZASS-er-BAY-shun\"). To find out if you have COPD, a doctor will: Do a physical exam and listen to your lungs. Have you do breathing tests, including spirometry, to find out how well your lungs work. Do chest X-rays and other tests to help rule out other problems that could be causing your symptoms. If there is a chance you could have COPD, it is very important to find out as soon as you can. This gives you time to take steps to slow the damage to your lungs. The best way to slow COPD is to quit smoking. No matter how long you have smoked or how serious your COPD is, quitting smoking can help stop the damage to your lungs. If you get an inhaler, it is very important to use it just the way your health provider shows you. In time, you may need to use oxygen some or most of the time. People who have COPD are more likely to get lung infections, so you will need to get a flu vaccine every year. There are many things you can do at home to stay as healthy as you can. Avoid things that can irritate your lungs, such as smoke and air pollution. If you are losing weight, ask your doctor or dietitian about ways to make it easier to get the calories you need.

Cryoglobulins are abnormal proteins that thicken and clump together at cold temperatures, usually below 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (the average human body temperature). Eventually, damage or inflammation of affected blood vessels and surrounding tissue can develop, a condition known as vasculitis. Common symptoms include skin lesions, joint pain (arthralgia), and weakness, but specific symptoms can vary greatly from one person to another and can potentially involve multiple organ systems. Mixed cryoglobulinemia is believed to be an immune-mediated disorder (in which the immune system response to chronic infection causes damage to various tissues) or an autoimmune disorder (in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissue). Many cases of mixed cryoglobulinemia are associated with chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus. In rare cases, no underlying cause for the disorder can be identified (essential mixed cryoglobulinemia). The immune system is divided into several components, the combined actions of which are responsible for defending against infectious agents. The T cell system (cell-mediated immune response) contributes to fighting several viruses, some bacteria and yeast and fungi. The B cell system (humoral immune response) fights infection caused by other viruses and bacteria. It does so by secreting immune factors called antibodies (also known as immunoglobulins) into the fluid portion of the blood (serum) and body secretions (e.g. Type I cryoglobulinemia is usually associated with an underlying disorder, specifically certain types of cancer. Unlike type I cryoglobulinemia, the cryoglobulins in type II and type III contain rheumatoid factor, which is an autoantibody (i.e. The distinction between type II and type III cryoglobulinemia is mostly technical and deals with whether the rheumatoid factor is monoclonal or polyclonal.

Your mother or sister has or had endometriosis. Your menstrual cycles are less than 28 days. Your menstrual flow is longer than 7 days. Your uterus, cervix, or vagina has an abnormal shape that blocks or slows menstrual flow."], [1762, "Endometriosis What Happens", "Endometriosis is usually a long-lasting (chronic) disease. When you have endometriosis, the type of tissue that lines your uterus is also growing outside your uterus. The clumps of tissue (called implants) may have grown on your ovaries or fallopian tubes, the outer wall of the uterus, the intestines, or other organs in the belly. This is why endometriosis pain may start as mild discomfort a few days before the menstrual period and then usually is gone by the time the period ends. But if an implant grows in a sensitive area, it can cause constant pain or pain during certain activities, such as sex, exercise, or bowel movements. There is no way to predict whether endometriosis will get worse, will improve, or will stay the same until menopause. Between 20% and 40% of women who are infertile have endometriosis (some have more than one possible cause of infertility).1 Experts don't fully understand how endometriosis causes infertility. This blood-filled growth is called an ovarian endometrioma or an endometrial cyst. The symptoms of an ovarian cyst may be the same as those of endometriosis. Also, ovarian cancer risk is slightly higher in women who have endometriosis.3 This type of ovarian cancer is most commonly seen in women older than 60."], [1763, "Endometriosis Symptoms", "Symptoms may include: Pain, which can be: Pelvic pain.Severe menstrual cramps.Low backache 1 or 2 days before the start of the menstrual period (or earlier).Pain during sexual intercourse.Rectal pain.Pain during bowel movements.

This can include: Blood in the urine or stool.Some vaginal bleeding before the start of the menstrual period.Vaginal bleeding after sex. Some vaginal bleeding before the start of the menstrual period. Symptoms are often most severe just before and during your menstrual period. Some women, especially teens, have pain all the time. Several other conditions can cause symptoms that are similar to endometriosis. These conditions include painful periods, adenomyosis, and uterine fibroids."], [1764, "Endometriosis Cause", "Possible causes include the following: Your immune system may not be getting rid of endometrial cells outside of the uterus like it should. Heavy bleeding or an abnormal structure of the uterus, cervix, or vagina causes too many endometrial cells to go up through the fallopian tubes and then into the belly. Blood or lymph fluid may carry endometrial cells to other parts of the body. Or the cells may be moved during a surgery, such as an episiotomy or a cesarean delivery. Cells in the belly and pelvis may change into endometrial cells."], [1765, "Endometriosis Health Tools", "Health Tools help you make wise health decisions or take action to improve your health.

And it usually isn't dangerous. They usually grow on the ovaries, the fallopian tubes, the outer wall of the uterus, the intestines, or other organs in the belly. Your uterus is lined with a type of tissue called endometrium (say \"en-doh-MEE-tree-um\"). Each month, your body releases hormones that cause the endometrium to thicken and get ready for an egg. If you do not get pregnant, the endometrium breaks down, and your body sheds it as blood. When you have endometriosis, the implants of tissue outside your uterus act just like the tissue lining your uterus. The implants can get irritated and painful. Sometimes they form scar tissue or fluid-filled sacs (cysts). It is during these years-usually from their teens into their 40s-that women have endometriosis. Estrogen levels drop when menstrual periods stop (menopause). You may have pain in your lower belly, your rectum or vagina, or your lower back. Some women have more pain during sex, when they have a bowel movement, or when their ovaries release an egg (ovulation). Some women have heavy periods, spotting or bleeding between periods, bleeding after sex, or blood in their urine or stool. Trouble getting pregnant (infertility). Endometriosis varies from woman to woman. Some women don't know that they have it until they go to see a doctor because they can't get pregnant or have a procedure for another problem. Some have mild cramping that they think is normal for them. In other women, the pain and bleeding are so bad that they aren't able to work or go to school. Many different problems can cause painful or heavy periods. To find out if you have endometriosis, your doctor will: Ask questions about your symptoms, your periods, your past health, and your family history. Endometriosis sometimes runs in families. This may include checking both your vagina and rectum. If it seems like you have endometriosis, your doctor may suggest that you try medicine for a few months. If you get better using medicine, you probably have endometriosis. To find out if you have a cyst on an ovary, you might have an imaging test like an ultrasound, an MRI, or a CT scan. The only way to be sure you have endometriosis is to have a type of surgery called laparoscopy (say \"lap-uh-ROSS-kuh-pee\"). If the doctor finds implants, scar tissue, or cysts, he or she can remove them during the same surgery. There is no cure for endometriosis, but there are good treatments. You may need to try several treatments to find what works best for you. With any treatment, there is a chance that your symptoms could come back. Treatment choices depend on whether you want to control pain or you want to get pregnant. For pain and bleeding, you can try medicines or surgery. Treatments for endometriosis include: Over-the-counter pain medicines like ibuprofen (such as Advil or Motrin) or naproxen (such as Aleve). These medicines are called anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. Birth control pills are often used to treat endometriosis. But it can cause side effects, and pain may come back after treatment ends. Like birth control pills, hormone therapy will keep you from getting pregnant. Laparoscopy to remove implants and scar tissue. This may reduce pain, and it may also help you get pregnant. As a last resort for severe pain, some women have their uterus and ovaries removed (hysterectomy and oophorectomy). If you are getting close to menopause, you may want to try to manage your symptoms with medicines rather than surgery. Endometriosis usually stops causing problems when you stop having periods.

They keep your body's fluids in balance and help keep your body working normally, including your heart rhythm, muscle contraction, and brain function. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is also measured in this test. CO2 is a waste product made when the body breaks down food for energy (metabolism). It takes the form of bicarbonate in the blood, so this part of the test is sometimes called a bicarbonate test. An electrolyte panel measures the blood levels of carbon dioxide, chloride, potassium, and sodium."], [1768, "Elder Abuse", "Elder abuse refers to any of several forms of maltreatment of an older person by a caregiver, family member, spouse, or friend. The 1987 Amendment to the Older Americans Act identified three separate categories of elder abuse: Domestic elder abuse usually takes place in the older adult's home or in the home of the caregiver. The abuser is often a relative, close friend, or paid companion. Institutional abuse refers to abuse that takes place in a residential home (such as a nursing home), foster home, or assisted-living facility. Self-neglect is present when an older adult refuses or fails to provide himself or herself with adequate food, water, clothing, shelter, personal hygiene, medicine, and safety precautions. Elder abuse can include: Acts of violence, such as hitting, beating, pushing, shoving, shaking, slapping, kicking, pinching, choking, or burning. It includes unwanted touching and all types of sexual assault or battery, such as rape, sodomy, forced nudity, and sexually explicit photography. Treating an older person like a baby, giving an older person the \"silent treatment,\" and isolating him or her from family, friends, or regular activities are examples of emotional or psychological abuse. Neglect, such as failing to provide an older person with food, clothing, personal shelter, or other essentials, such as medical care or medicines. Neglect can also include failing to pay nursing home or assisted-living facility costs for an older person if you have a legal responsibility to do so. Abandonment or desertion of an older person by a person who has the physical or legal responsibility for providing care. Illegal or improper use of an older person's funds, property, or assets. This includes forging an older person's signature, stealing money or possessions, or tricking an older person into signing documents that transfer funds, property, or assets. People who abuse older adults (particularly their adult children) are often dependent on the older person for financial help and other support. Caregivers and family members who live with an older person have the opportunity to abuse and often attempt to isolate the older person from others to prevent the abuse from being discovered. Signs and symptoms of elder abuse vary widely depending on the type of abuse. Signs that an older person is the victim of acts of violence may include: Bruises, black eyes, welts, lacerations, rope marks, cuts, punctures, or untreated injuries in various stages of healing.Broken bones, including the skull.Sprains, dislocations, or internal injuries.Broken eyeglasses or dentures.Signs of being restrained.Laboratory reports of overdose or underuse of medicines.Reports from the older adult of being physically mistreated.An older person's sudden change in behavior.A caregiver's refusal to allow visitors to see an older person alone. Symptoms of possible sexual abuse include bruises around the breasts or genital area, unexplained venereal disease or genital infections, unexplained vaginal or anal bleeding, underclothing that is torn or stained, and reports from the older person of being sexually assaulted. Emotional or psychological abuse is possible if the older person appears emotionally upset or agitated; acts withdrawn or is noncommunicative, nonresponsive, or paranoid; exhibits unusual behavior including sucking, biting, and rocking; or if he or she reports being verbally or emotionally mistreated. Signs of neglect may include dehydration, malnutrition, untreated health problems, pressure ulcers, poor personal hygiene, hazardous or unsanitary living conditions, and reports from the older person of being mistreated. Abandonment includes the desertion of an older person at a hospital, nursing facility, shopping center, or other public location. Signs of financial exploitation include sudden changes in a bank account or banking practice, such as unexplained withdrawals of large amounts of money; additional names on an older person's bank card; abrupt changes in a will or other financial document; disappearance of funds or valuable possessions; unpaid bills or substandard care despite the availability of funds; evidence of the older person's signature being forged; the sudden appearance of previously uninvolved relatives; payment for unnecessary services; and reports from the older person of financial exploitation. If you are worried that someone you know might be a victim of elder abuse, talk to your doctor about what to look for, what the risks are, and what help is available.

Introduction The term epidermolytic ichthyosis was agreed upon by the International Ichthyosis Consensus Group in 2009 and replaces the older, confusing labels of bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (Brocq) and epidermolytic hyperkeratosis. A number of disorders show epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, including EI, superficial epidermolytic ichthyosis bullosa and desmosomal disorders such as McGrath ectodermal dysplasia-skin fragility syndrome.

The bile duct is a tube that allows the passage of bile from the liver into the gall bladder and, eventually, the small intestine. Bile is a liquid secreted by the liver that plays an essential role in carrying waste products from the liver and promoting absorption of fats and vitamins by the intestines. In extrahepatic biliary atresia, absence or destruction of the bile ducts results in the abnormal accumulation of bile in the liver."], [1771, "Egg Allergy", "A food allergy occurs when your immune system responds defensively to a specific food protein that, in reality, is not harmful to the body. The first time you eat the offending food, the immune system responds by creating specific disease-fighting antibodies (called immunoglobulin E or IgE). When you eat the food again, the IgE antibodies spring into action, releasing large amounts of histamine in an effort to expel the \"foreign invader\" from the body. Histamine is a powerful chemical that can affect the respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, skin, or cardiovascular system. Symptoms of a food allergy may appear almost immediately, or up to two hours after you've eaten the food. Symptoms can include a tingling sensation of the mouth, swelling of the tongue and throat, hives, skin rashes, vomiting, abdominal cramps, difficulty breathing, diarrhea, a drop in blood pressure, or even a loss of consciousness. There are eight foods that cause over 90% of food allergies in children -- milk, eggs, peanuts, wheat, soy, and tree nuts (such as walnuts, pecans, and almonds). In adults, 90% of food allergies are caused by peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish. Your doctor may do a radioallergosorbent blood test (RAST) to check the number of antibodies produced by your immune system. Elevated levels of certain types of antibodies can help your doctor identify specific food allergies. The doctor may also perform an allergy skin test, also called a scratch test, to identify the substances that are causing your allergy symptoms. By keeping a food diary, your doctor will have a much better starting point to determine the foods that could trigger your allergies. For rashes, antihistamines can help reduce itching and may also relieve congestion and other symptoms. In life-threatening situations, an epinephrine injection can immediately begin to reverse symptoms and is the only effective treatment option."], [1772, "Effective Tooth Brushing and Flossing", "With proper care, your teeth and gums can stay healthy throughout your life. The healthier your teeth and gums are, the less risk you have for tooth decay and gum disease. There are five basic steps to caring for teeth and gums: Brushing Flossing Rinsing Eating right Visiting the dentist Brush at least twice a day. Ideally wait 30 minutes after eating, this will allow any enamel that softened from acid during eating to re-harden and not get brushed away. Brushing removes plaque, a film of bacteria that clings to teeth. To brush: Place a pea-sized dab of fluoride toothpaste on the head of the toothbrush. Place the toothbrush against the teeth at a 45-degree angle up to the gum line. Avoid pressing so hard that the bristles lie flat against the teeth. Make sure the bristles get into the grooves and crevices. To clean the inside of the bottom front teeth, angle the head in an up-and-down position toward the bottom inside of the mouth and move the toothbrush in a small circle. Give your tongue a few gentle brush strokes, brushing from the back of your tongue forward. After brushing your teeth for two to three minutes, rinse your mouth with water. Replace your toothbrush with a new one every three to four months. Flossing gets rid of food and plaque between the teeth, where your toothbrush cannot reach. If plaque stays between teeth, it can harden into tartar, which must be removed by a dentist or hygienist. Floss the top teeth first, then the bottom. Place the floss in your mouth and use your index fingers to push the floss between the teeth. Be careful not to push too hard and injure the gums. Move the floss up and down against the tooth and up and around the gum line. Rinse with an antiseptic mouthwash at least once a day to kill bacteria that cause plaque and early gum disease. A fluoride rinse can help prevent teeth decay and cavities. For good dental health, eat a variety of foods, but minimize those that contain sugars and starches. These foods produce the most acids in the mouth and the longer they stay in the mouth, the more they can damage the teeth. Snacking on sugary foods can lead to tooth decay, because most people don't brush after snacks. Starchy snack foods, like potato chips, stick to the teeth. Avoid snacking on: Candies, cookies, cakes, and pie Sugary gum Crackers, breadsticks, and chips Dried fruits and raisins Visit your dentist at least once every six months. To maintain healthy teeth and gums, it's important to have regular check-ups and professional cleanings. You should also see your dentist if you have pain in your teeth or mouth or bleeding, swollen gums. This coating protects the tooth from decay and usually lasts a long time, but can only be placed on a tooth without decay. In addition to the above four steps above, antibacterial mouth rinses reduce bacteria that cause plaque and gum disease, according to the American Dental Association (ADA). Fluoride mouth rinses also help reduce and prevent tooth decay."], [1773, "EEC Syndrome", "Affected individuals often have abnormalities affecting the limbs including ectrodactyly, a condition in which part or all of the central digits (fingers or toes) are missing. A groove or gap in the upper lip (cleft lip) and a groove or gap in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) may also occur. Individuals with EEC syndrome can also develop a variety of additional symptoms including abnormalities of the genitourinary system and the eyes. Most cases of EEC syndrome are caused by mutations of the p63 gene and are either new (spontaneous) mutations or are inherited as autosomal dominant disorders. Introduction There are at least four other syndromes caused by mutations of the p63 gene including AEC/Hay-wells syndrome, Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome, limb-mammary syndrome, and ADULT syndrome. In addition, p63 mutations have also been reported as the cause of nonsyndromic split hand/foot malformation and nonsyndromic cleft lip/palate (CL/P). Despite the overlap, the p63-associated syndromes have their own characteristic physical findings related, in part, to the specific mutation of the p63 gene present. These syndromes are further classified as forms of ectodermal dysplasia, a group of disorders characterized by abnormalities that occur during early embryonic development."], [1774, "Edema, Idiopathic", "\"Edema\" is the medical term for swelling. Medications, pregnancy, infections, and many other medical problems can cause edema. Edema happens when your small blood vessels leak fluid into nearby tissues. That extra fluid builds up, which makes the tissue swell. This usually affects the legs, feet, and ankles, but it can also happen in the arms. This happens when fluid gathers in your feet and lower legs. It can make it harder to move around in part because you may not have as much feeling in your feet. This swelling in the arms and legs is most often caused by damage to your lymph nodes, tissues that help filter germs and waste from your body. The damage may be the result of cancer treatments like surgery and radiation. When fluid collects in the air sacs in your lungs, you have pulmonary edema. That makes it hard for you to breathe, and it's worse when you lie down. If it happens suddenly, call 911. Things like a twisted ankle, a bee sting, or a skin infection will cause edema. In some cases, like an infection, this may be helpful. Edema can also come from other conditions or from when the balance of substances in your blood is off. Low albumin may contribute to edema, but it's not usually the only cause. A blood clot in the deep veins of your leg can cause leg edema. A tumor blocking the flow of blood or another fluid called lymph can cause edema. Burns, life-threatening infections, or other critical illnesses can cause a reaction that allows fluid to leak into tissues almost everywhere. This can cause edema all over your body. When the heart weakens and pumps blood less effectively, fluid can slowly build up, creating leg edema. If fluid builds up quickly, you can get fluid in the lungs. If your heart failure is on the right side of your heart, edema can develop in the abdomen. Severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis, causes you to retain fluid. Fluid leaks into the abdomen and can also cause leg edema. A kidney condition called nephrotic syndrome can cause severe leg edema and sometimes whole-body edema. Mild leg edema is common during pregnancy. But serious complications of pregnancy like deep vein thrombosis and preeclampsia can also cause edema. Head trauma , low blood sodium (called hyponatremia), high altitudes, brain tumors, and a block in fluid drainage in the brain (known as hydrocephalus) can cause cerebral edema. Many medicines can cause edema, including: NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen and naproxen) Calcium channel blockers Corticosteroids (like prednisone and methylprednisolone) Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone Pramipexole When they cause swelling, usually it's mild leg edema. Edema in a small area from an infection or inflammation (like a mosquito bite) may cause no symptoms. On the other hand, a large allergic reaction (such as from a bee sting) may cause edema on your entire arm that can bring pain and limit your arm's movement. Food allergies and allergic reactions to medicine may cause tongue or throat edema. Leg edema can make the legs feel heavy. In edema and heart disease, for example, the legs may easily weigh an extra 5 or 10 pounds each. Severe leg edema can interfere with blood flow, leading to ulcers on the skin. Pulmonary edema causes shortness of breath and sometimes low oxygen levels in the blood. If the tissue springs back to its normal shape, it's called non-pitting edema. It's a symptom that may help your doctor figure out the cause of your edema. To treat edema, you often must treat its underlying cause. For example, you might take allergy medications to treat swelling from allergies. They break down the clot and get drainage back to normal. Leg edema related to congestive heart failure or liver disease can be treated with a diuretic (sometimes called a ''water pill'') like furosemide (Lasix). When you can pee more, fluid from the legs can flow back into the blood."], [1775, "EDA", "HED is primarily characterized by partial or complete absence of certain sweat glands (eccrine glands), causing lack of or diminished sweating (anhidrosis or hypohidrosis), heat intolerance, and fever; abnormally sparse hair (hypotrichosis), and absence (hypodontia) and/or malformation of certain teeth. However, the skin around the eyes (periorbital) may be darkly pigmented (hyperpigmentation) and finely wrinkled, appearing prematurely aged. In many cases, affected infants and children may also exhibit underdevelopment (hypoplasia) or absence (aplasia) of mucous glands within the respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts and, in some cases, decreased function of certain components of the immune system (e.g., depressed lymphocyte function, and rarely cellular immune hypofunction), potentially causing an increased susceptibility to certain infections and/or allergic conditions. Many affected infants and children experience recurrent attacks of wheezing and breathlessness (asthma), respiratory infections; chronic inflammation of the nasal passages (atrophic rhinitis), scaling, itchy (pruritic) skin rashes (eczema), and/or other findings. HED is usually inherited as an X-linked recessive genetic trait and is caused by a mutation in the ectodysplasin-A (EDA) gene; in such cases, the disorder is fully expressed in males only. However, females who carry a single copy of the disease gene (heterozygote carriers) may exhibit some of the symptoms and findings associated with the disorder. HED can also be inherited as an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive genetic trait, caused by mutations in the EDAR or EDARADD genes."], [1776, "E-D Syndrome", "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a group of hereditary connective tissue disorders characterized by defects of the major structural protein in the body (collagen).

The different types of EDS were originally categorized in a classification system that used Roman numerals (e.g., EDS I to EDS XI), based upon each form's associated symptoms and findings (clinical evidence) and underlying cause. A revised, simplified classification system (revised nosology) has since been described in the medical literature that categorizes EDS into six major subtypes, based upon clinical evidence, underlying biochemical defects, and mode of inheritance."], [1777, "Eczema, Atopic", "Eczema is a term for a group of medical conditions that cause the skin to become inflamed or irritated. Atopic refers to a group of diseases with an often inherited tendency to develop other allergic conditions, such as asthma and hay fever. Most infants who develop the condition outgrow it by their tenth birthday, while some people continue to have symptoms on and off throughout life. No matter which part of the skin is affected, eczema is almost always itchy. Sometimes the itching will start before the rash appears, but when it does, the rash most commonly appears on the face, back of the knees, wrists, hands, or feet. In fair-skinned people, these areas may initially appear reddish and then turn brown. Among darker-skinned people, eczema can affect pigmentation, making the affected area lighter or darker. In infants, the itchy rash can produce an oozing, crusting condition that happens mainly on the face and scalp, but patches may appear anywhere. Also, defects in the skin barrier could allow moisture out and germs in. Some people may have \"flare-ups\" of the itchy rash in response to certain substances or conditions. For some, coming into contact with rough or coarse materials may cause the skin to become itchy. For others, feeling too hot or too cold, exposure to certain household products like soap or detergent, or coming into contact with animal dander may cause an outbreak. Although there is no cure, most people can effectively manage their disease with medical treatment and by avoiding irritants. While there are no tests to determine eczema, most often your doctor can tell if it's eczema by looking at your skin and by asking a few questions. The goal of treatment for eczema is to relieve and prevent itching, which can lead to infection. Since the disease makes skin dry and itchy, lotions and creams are recommended to keep the skin moist. These products are usually applied when the skin is damp, such as after bathing, to help the skin retain moisture. Cold compresses may also be used to relieve itching. Over-the-counter products, such as hydrocortisone 1% cream, or prescription creams and ointments containing corticosteroids, are often prescribed to lessen inflammation. Other treatments include antihistamines to lessen severe itching, tar treatments (chemicals designed to reduce itching), phototherapy (therapy using ultraviolet light applied to the skin), and the drug cyclosporine for people whose condition doesn't respond to other treatments. The FDA has approved two drugs known as topical immunomodulators (TIMs) for the treatment of mild-to-moderate eczema. The drugs, Elidel and Protopic, are skin creams that work by altering the immune system response to prevent flare-ups. The FDA has warned doctors to prescribe Elidel and Protopic with caution due to concerns over a possible cancer risk associated with their use. The warning advises doctors to prescribe short-term use of Elidel and Protopic only after other available eczema treatments have failed in adults and children over the age of 2. Eczema outbreaks can sometimes be avoided or the severity lessened by following these simple tips."], [1778, "Ectropion (Drooping Eyelids)", "As we get older, the lower eyelids sometimes start to droop away from the eyeball. If your lower eyelids droop outward, away from the eye (ectropion), they may no longer be able to protect your eyes, and your eyes may become dry and irritated. If your eyelids turn inward (entropion), forcing the lashes onto the eye, this also may cause irritation and possible damage. Also, drooping eyelids can prevent tears from draining normally, so tears may run down your cheeks.

When you treat a disease early, you may be able to prevent or delay problems from the disease. Your doctor may suggest: Screening tests, which find health problems before symptoms appear. Diagnostic tests, medical exams, and self-exams, which find a disease or other health problem early in its course. You and your doctor can use recommendations made by expert panels of health professionals to help you decide what screening tests you need. Risk factors are things that make getting a disease more likely. Cholesterol screening, for example, is recommended for people who have a family history of early coronary artery disease. A woman who is pregnant or trying to become pregnant may be screened for genetic conditions and other conditions that may affect her or her baby. See which screening tests you may need: When and how often you get screening tests may depend on your age, your gender, your health status, your risk factors, and the cost of testing. When you are thinking about getting a screening test, talk with your doctor. Find out about the disease, what the test is like, how the test may help you or hurt you, and how much the test costs. You may also want to ask what further testing and follow-up will be needed if a screening test result shows a possible problem. For example: Ask your doctor how likely it is that the test would miss a disease (false negative), show something that looks like you have a disease when you don't (false positive), or find a disease that will never cause a problem. In this case, you may decide that you don't want the screening test. For example, if you are going to be tested for osteoporosis, are you willing to take medicine or make lifestyle changes if the test shows that you have it?"], [1782, "Eisenmenger Complex", "Eisenmenger syndrome occurs when a birth defect -- doctors call it a \"congenital heart abnormality\" -- changes the way blood flows through the heart. People with this condition have a high risk of heart failure, stroke, and premature death. As your heart beats, blood travels from the body into the right atrium, which sends it to the right ventricle. The right ventricle pumps the blood to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. When that oxygen-carrying blood goes back to the heart, the left atrium takes it in and passes it to the left ventricle, which sends it out to your body. But in people with Eisenmenger syndrome, there's often a hole between chambers - usually between the left and right ventricle. When that happens: Oxygen-rich blood gets sent back to the lungs instead of flowing out to your body. High blood pressure in the lungs causes blood to back up in the heart and leak into the left ventricle. The left ventricle sends the backed-up blood (which hasn't picked up oxygen) out to your body. If that defect isn't found and corrected early, it can result in more problems, like high blood pressure in your lungs (pulmonary hypertension) and heart failure. Of all the people who are born with a heart defect, about 1 in 12 will develop Eisenmenger syndrome. But that rate may be dropping, because doctors are more able to discover and repair those defects early in life. These symptoms are easiest to spot: A bluish color to the skin because of lack of oxygen (cyanosis) Wide fingertips and toes (clubbing) Shortness of breath Fluid buildup in parts of the body (edema) An abnormal heart rhythm Dizziness or headaches Chest pains Swelling in the joints (gout) The condition can also affect the body's production of red blood cells (they carry oxygen), cause blood clotting or excessive bleeding. If your child's doctor suspects Eisenmenger syndrome, he might refer her to a specialist who deals with heart problems in children and young adults. That specialist will look for: Blue skin Signs of an improper opening between two heart chambers (cardiac shunt) High blood pressure in the lungs that won't respond to drugs Your doctor will also want to do: Imaging tests like an X-rays, CT scan, or an echocardiogram An electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) or a walking test (to measure your heart rate and blood flow) Blood tests (to look for abnormally high or abnormally low red blood cell counts) Cardiac catheterization (for detailed information about the heart) Lung function tests (to measure how much oxygen is getting to your bloodstream) If those tests point to Eisenmenger syndrome, your doctor will talk with you about a treatment plan. The focus will be on lowering blood pressure in the artery that carries blood to the lungs and getting more oxygen to the body. This can be done in a variety of ways, ranging from drugs to major surgery. The plan might involve taking medicines that: Relax the arteries to improve blood flow Keep your heart beating at a regular rhythm Prevent infections (antibiotics) Prevent blood clots (blood thinners) Your doctor may also want you to take iron supplements.

Guided imagery is based on the concept that your body and mind are connected. Using all of your senses, your body seems to respond as though what you are imagining is real. An example often used is to imagine an orange or a lemon in great detail-the smell, the color, the texture of the peel. Continue to imagine the smell of the lemon, and then see yourself taking a bite of the lemon and feel the juice squirting into your mouth. You can achieve a relaxed state when you imagine all the details of a safe, comfortable place, such as a beach or a garden. This relaxed state may aid healing, learning, creativity, and performance. It may help you feel more in control of your emotions and thought processes, which may improve your attitude, health, and sense of well-being. You can use it to promote relaxation, which can lower blood pressure and reduce other problems related to stress.

Due to the impaired function of this enzyme, excessive amounts of particular porphyrins accumulate, particularly in the bone marrow, plasma, red blood cells, urine, teeth, and bones. The major symptom of this disorder is hypersensitivity of the skin to sunlight and some types of artificial light, such as fluorescent lights (photosensitivity). Affected offspring have two copies of the defective gene, one inherited from each parent. CEP is one of a group of disorders known as the porphyrias. Each porphyria is characterized by abnormally high levels of particular chemicals (porphyrins) in the body due to deficiencies of certain enzymes in the step-wise synthesis of heme, the essential component of hemoglobin and various hemo-proteins. The symptoms associated with the various types of porphyria differ, depending upon the specific enzyme that is deficient.

Watching your baby grow in size is part of the fun of being a new parent. This weight usually is regained within 10 to 12 days. Most newborns gain about 4 oz (113 g) to 8 oz (227 g) a week and grow about 1 in. Cognition is the ability to think, learn, and remember. You promote healthy brain growth every time you interact in a positive way with your baby. At first, instinctual behaviors, such as crying when uncomfortable, are your baby's ways to signal his or her needs. Soon your newborn starts to subtly communicate and interact with you. And his or her face will brighten when you cuddle and talk soothingly. Even at a few days old, your baby may try to mimic you sticking out your tongue. Your newborn is listening to and absorbing the basic and distinct sounds of language. Your newborn quickly learns to recognize your face, the sound of your voice, and how you smell. Your baby also has a strong sense of smell. After a few days, your newborn hears fairly well and responds most noticeably to high-pitched and loud sounds. Your baby recognizes and prefers sweet tastes to those that are sour, bitter, or salty. Motor skills develop as your baby's muscles and nerves work together. Movements are mostly controlled by reflexes, such as the rooting reflex, which is when a newborn's head turns and his or her mouth \"reaches\" toward a touch. Hands are tightly fisted when the baby is alert. The most important way to help your baby grow and develop is to communicate with him or her. Use a high-pitched voice, gentle touch, hugs, and kisses. An environment that is rich in stimulation, comfort, and loving attention enhances many areas of a baby's development. Research shows that babies who are talked to throughout their first few years usually learn language skills more easily than those who are not. You may feel overwhelmed during your baby's first month and wonder \"Am I doing this right?\" It is completely normal to be confused and frustrated by your newborn. You will become familiar with your newborn's needs by paying attention to his or her behavior. For example, a fussy cry and turning away usually means \"Change what we are doing.\" And an alert, bright-eyed look means \"I am interested in what's going on.\" Trusting your instincts-to cuddle and rock a crying baby or to talk to your baby in a high-pitched \"baby talk\" voice-is usually the \"right\" thing to do. You will begin to develop a rhythm with your baby, where you will be able to read each other's needs and moods. Your baby's doctor will likely recommend a specific schedule of routine newborn visits. These visits are important to check for problems and to make sure that your child is growing and developing as expected. Do not be afraid to call your baby's doctor any time you have concerns about your newborn's health or general care.

They also are more involved with friends and are learning to think in more complex ways. Progress in the major areas of development-physical, intellectual, emotional, and social-is gradual. But the changes you will see in your child from one year to the next can be dramatic. Many children learn to throw, hit a baseball, or kick a soccer ball. From ages 6 to 10, your child develops a more mature and logical way of thinking. He or she gradually becomes able to consider several parts to a problem or situation. Even though their thinking becomes more complex, children in this age group still think in concrete terms. For example, actually touching the soft fur of a rabbit is more meaningful to a child than being told that an object is \"soft like a rabbit.\" Because they still can mostly consider only one part of a situation or perspective at a time, children of this age have difficulty fully understanding how things are connected. When children enter school, they leave the security of home and family. They become players on the larger stage of school and friends. Here, they learn some crucial skills-including how to make friends-that they can use for the rest of their lives. Children's self-esteem, which is their sense of worth and belonging, is fragile and can change rapidly depending on what is happening around them. At times, children of this age seem like little adults as they march off to school with backpacks full of responsibilities. Parents often overestimate their children's ability to make good decisions. Children of this age need firm and consistent rules that are explained clearly and compassionately. Effective parents are able to give their children enough independence to learn from their successes and failures and at the same time provide consistent direction and unconditional support.

A child this age makes great strides in being able to think and reason. In these years, children learn their letters, counting, and colors. Between the ages of 2 and 5, children gradually learn how to manage their feelings. By age 5, friends become important. By age 2, most children can say at least 50 words. By age 5, a child may know thousands of words and be able to carry on conversations and tell stories. Sensory and motor development. By age 2, most children can walk up stairs one at a time, kick a ball, and draw simple strokes with a pencil. By age 5, most can dress and undress themselves and write some lowercase and capital letters. Each child grows and gains skills at his or her own pace. It is common for a child to be ahead in one area, such as language, but a little behind in another. Learning what is normal for children this age can help you spot problems early or feel better about how your child is doing. Routine checkups usually are scheduled several times during ages 2 to 5. During these visits, the doctor will: Give your child a physical exam. Weigh and measure your child to see how he or she compares to other children of the same age. Ask questions about your child's behavior and your family. Well-child visits are a good time to talk with your doctor about any concerns you have about your child's health, growth, or behavior. Between visits, write down any questions you want to ask the doctor next time. Temper tantrums, thumb-sucking, and nightmares are common issues in children this age. Knowing what to expect can help you to be patient and get through the stressful moments. The best thing you can do for your child is to show your love and affection. But there are also many other ways you can help your preschooler grow and learn. Keep lots of fruits, vegetables, and healthy snacks in the house. Make time for your child to be active. Limit TV and computer time to 2 hours a day or less. Read and talk to your child. This helps children learn language and opens them up to new ideas. Between the ages of 2 and 5, children need about 11 to 13 hours of sleep each day. Preschool or play groups can be a great way for children to learn to interact. Teach skills, such as how to get dressed and how to use the toilet. Taking a parenting class can help you learn how to deal with issues as they arise.

Emotions can change quickly as teens learn to deal with school, their friends, and adult expectations. Teen self-esteem is affected by success in school, sports, and friendships. Teens tend to compare themselves with others, and they might form false ideas about their body image. The influence of TV, magazines, and the Internet can add to a teen's poor body image. For parents, the teen years are a time to get to know their teenager. While teens are maturing, they still need a parent's love and guidance. But it is still important for teens to have good support from their parents so that they can get through these years with as few problems as possible. There are four basic areas of teenage development: Physical development. Most teens enter puberty by age 15. Girls go through a time of rapid growth right before their first menstrual period. And by age 15, girls are near their adult height. Boys usually continue to grow taller and gain weight through their teen years. As they mature, teens are more able to think about and understand abstract ideas such as morality. Even though they have a certain amount of empathy and can understand that others have different ideas, they often strongly believe that their own ideas are the most true. Emotional and social development. Much of teens' emotional and social growth is about finding their place in the world. Boys continue to get stronger and more agile even after puberty. Getting plenty of exercise helps improve strength and coordination in boys and girls. The doctor will ask your teen questions about his or her life and activities. This helps the doctor check on your teen's mental and physical health. It's a good idea to give your teen some time alone with the doctor during these visits to talk in private. Your teen will also get the shots (immunizations) that are needed at each checkup. Teens should also see the dentist each year. Call your doctor if you have questions or concerns about your teen's physical or emotional health, such as: Delayed growth. Even though teens don't always welcome your help, they still need it. Your being available and involved in your teen's life can help your teen avoid risky behavior. It also helps your teen grow and develop into a healthy adult. Here are some things you can do: Encourage your teen to get enough sleep. Talk about body image and self worth. Encourage your teen to eat healthy foods and be active. Talk with your teen about drugs and alcohol. Involve your teen in setting household rules and schedules. Continue talking to your teen about dating and sex.

Expect your child to grow about 3 in. Your child will start to remember recent events and actions, understand symbols, imitate, imagine, and pretend. Around the same time, toddlers typically want to do things on their own or according to their own wishes. This sets the stage for conflict, confusion, and occasional breakdowns. At 15 to 18 months, a typical toddler understands 10 times more words than he or she can speak. By the second birthday, most toddlers can say at least 50 words. Motor skills develop as your child's muscles and nerves work together. During a well-child visit, the doctor examines your child to find out whether he or she is growing as expected. Your child will get any needed immunizations, and the doctor will ask you questions about the new things your child is doing, such as saying any words or walking. The doctor may also check your child for signs of developmental problems such as autism. Talk to your child's doctor about when to make these appointments. Talk to your doctor if your child is not reaching normal growth and development milestones. A child who is slow to reach milestones in one area, such as talking, may be ahead in another area, such as walking. See your doctor if your child makes repetitive motions or odd movements or has not bonded well with others, especially caregivers. Also, watch for signs of hearing problems, such as not reacting to people or loud noises. Do not hesitate to talk to your doctor anytime you have concerns about your child, even if you are not sure exactly what worries you.

Your child grows taller and stronger and also starts to feel and think in more mature ways. You may feel amazed as you watch your child begin to turn into an adult. Both must get used to the new person the child is becoming. From ages 11 through 14, a child develops in four main areas: Physical development. Adolescence is a time of change throughout the body. A growth spurt usually occurs near the time of puberty. Boys may lag behind girls in height during these years, but they usually end up taller. Kids this age typically focus on the present, but they are starting to understand that what they do now can have long-term effects. They are also beginning to see that issues are not just clear-cut and that information can be interpreted in different ways. Often, friends replace parents as a source of advice. Still, family support is important to help them build a strong sense of self. Kids this age may be a little awkward or clumsy. Getting regular moderate exercise can improve coordination and help your child build healthy habits. Yearly doctor visits are important to detect problems and to make sure your adolescent is growing and developing as expected. During these visits, the doctor will do a physical exam and give your child any needed shots. The doctor will also ask questions about your child's friends, school, and activities to see how he or she is doing. It is a good idea to give an adolescent some time alone with the doctor. This gives your child a chance to ask questions that he or she may not feel comfortable asking you. Call your doctor anytime you have a concern about your child's physical or emotional health, such as: A delay in growth or sexual development-for example, if puberty has not begun by age 14. Body image problems, such as a girl believing she is overweight when she is actually very thin. Signs of mental health issues, including depression, mood swings, fighting, missing school, or failing classes. A call or visit to your child's doctor can help you keep a healthy outlook and know how to recognize a true problem. This may help relieve tension between you and your child. Even if your child pushes you away at times, you still play a very big role in your child's life. While it is good to let your child make decisions, realize that adolescents need and want limits that are fair and firm. To promote healthy development: Help your child build healthy eating habits and a healthy body image. Serve balanced meals, and keep lots of fruits, vegetables, and other healthy foods in the house. Be a model of good eating and exercise habits for your child. Urge your child to get some exercise every day. Set limits on phone, computer, and TV use after a set evening hour. Involve your child in setting house rules. Talk about sex and other adult issues in an open and natural way. It is best to begin this discussion before puberty so the child knows what to expect. If you don't feel able to do this, ask for help from your doctor, a trusted friend or family member, or a counselor. Don't let your child rely on information from TV or other kids.

During the first year, other ways that you can help your baby grow and learn are to: Respond to your baby's cries. Crying is your baby's way to tell you what he or she needs. Remember that colic is normal-and temporary. Talking, reading, and playing are all important ways to help your baby's mind grow. Also give your baby plenty of time to explore safely. This can help your baby gain the confidence to try new skills, such as crawling and walking, and to grow into a healthy toddler. Keep your baby safe. Always put your baby to sleep on his or her back to reduce the risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Use a car seat every time your baby rides in a car. Know that your baby is curious, but set limits. A baby age 1 month to 12 months is too young to know that there are certain ways he or she should behave.

Newborns who develop group B strep within the first week are most always infected by their mothers. Newborns infected with group B strep may get a blood infection (sepsis) or lung infection (pneumonia). Newborns thought to be infected with group B strep need medical care right away, as the infection can be deadly. Pregnant women get tested for group B strep in the third trimester of pregnancy. Babies suspected of being infected are diagnosed at birth by testing their blood or spinal fluid or both for group B strep bacteria.

Germs that are growing in the nose or sinus cavities can climb up the Eustachian tube and enter the middle ear to start growing. Except for wellness baby visits, ear infections are the most common reason for trips to the pediatrician, accounting for approximately 30 million doctor visits a year in the U.S. Today, almost half of all antibiotic prescriptions written for children are for ear infections, and the cost of treating middle ear infections in the U.S. has been estimated at more than $2 billion a year. Untreated, ear infections can lead to more serious complications, including mastoiditis (a rare inflammation of a bone adjacent to the ear), hearing loss, perforation of the eardrum, meningitis, facial nerve paralysis, and possibly -- in adults -- Meniere's disease. When there is not enough fresh air ventilating the middle ear, such as when the Eustachian tube is clogged or blocked, the area becomes damp, stagnant, and warm, a perfect breeding ground for germs. When the doctor looks at the ear drum, he or she will see that it is red, often bulging, and be able to make the diagnosis of an ear infection. For children, the most common trigger of an ear infection is an upper respiratory viral infection, such as a cold or the flu. Allergies -- to pollen, dust, animal dander, or food -- can produce the same effect as a cold or flu, as can smoke, fumes, and other environmental toxins. Bacteria can cause an ear infection directly, but usually these organisms come on the heels of a viral infection or an allergic reaction, quickly finding their way into the warm, moist environment of the middle ear. Among the bacteria most often found in infected middle ears are the same varieties responsible for many cases of sinusitis, pneumonia, and other respiratory infections. According to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (ear, nose, and throat physicians), the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine is very effective against several strains of the most common bacteria that cause ear infections. If the condition clears up but comes back as many as three times in a 6-month period (or four times in a single year), the person is said to have recurrent ear infections (recurrent acute otitis media). A fluid buildup in the middle ear without infection is termed otitis media with effusion, a condition where fluid stays in the ear because it is not well ventilated, but germs have not started to grow. In recent years, scientists have identified the characteristics of people most likely to suffer recurrent middle ear infections: Males Individuals with a family history of ear infections Babies who are bottle-fed (breastfed babies get fewer ear infections) Children who attend day care centers People living in households with tobacco smokers People with abnormalities of the palate, such as a cleft palate People with poor immune systems or chronic respiratory diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and asthma"], [1799, "Guillain-Barre Syndrome", "Guillain-Barre Syndrome is a problem with your nervous system.

It could be that some illnesses alter your nerve cells, so your immune system starts to view them as threats. You may hear your doctor mention \"campylobacter.\" That's a type of bacteria associated with GBS. When you have it, your immune system begins attacking your nerve cells.

It is also the leading cause of hyperthyroidism, a condition in which the thyroid gland produces excessive hormones. In some cases, Graves' disease goes into remission or disappears completely after several months or years. Although the symptoms can cause discomfort, Graves' disease generally has no long-term adverse health consequences if the patient receives prompt and proper medical care. Hormones secreted by the thyroid gland control metabolism, or the speed at which the body converts food into energy. If, for some reason, the thyroid gland secretes an overabundance of these hormones, the body's metabolism goes into high gear, producing the pounding heart, sweating, trembling, and weight loss typically experienced by hyperthyroid people. Normally, the thyroid gets its production orders through another chemical called thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), released by the pituitary gland in the brain. But in Graves' disease, a malfunction in the body's immune system releases abnormal antibodies that mimic TSH. Spurred by these false signals to produce, the thyroid's hormone factories work overtime and exceed their normal quota. Studies show, for example, that if one identical twin contracts Graves' disease, there is a 20% likelihood that the other twin will get it, too. Even among those who do, the severity of their bout with Graves' has no bearing on the seriousness of the eye problem or how far the eyeballs protrude. If you have developed exophthalmos, your eyes may ache and feel dry and irritated. Protruding eyeballs are prone to excessive tearing and redness, partly because the eyelids can no longer shelter them effectively from injury. In severe cases of exophthalmos, which are rare, swollen eye muscles can put tremendous pressure on the optic nerve, possibly leading to partial blindness. Eye muscles weakened by long periods of inflammation can lose their ability to control movement, resulting in double vision.

And not all medicines for the health problems listed below are affected by grapefruit juice. But more than 50 medicines are affected by grapefruit juice. If you regularly drink grapefruit juice, ask your doctor or pharmacist if any of your medicines are affected by grapefruit juice. If your medicine is making you feel sick or is causing unusual or uncomfortable side effects, talk to your doctor. All new medicines are tested for problems caused by grapefruit juice before they are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Medicines that are affected by grapefruit juice must have warnings in their patient information sheets. When you pick up a new medicine, your pharmacist will talk to you or give you written information about foods to avoid while taking your medicine. In general, the more grapefruit juice you have, the greater the possible effects.1 It has been shown that even one glass of grapefruit juice-at any time of the day-is enough to cause certain medicines to work differently than they are supposed to.2 Sometimes the effects of one glass of juice can last up to 3 days. In many cases, you may be able to have a glass of grapefruit juice without problems. The problems you may have from taking medicines that are affected by grapefruit juice depend on the kind of medicine you are taking and how your body reacts. In general, older people are more likely than younger people to have serious problems. For example, if you are taking a medicine for high blood pressure, you may develop dangerously low blood pressure. If you are taking a medicine for high cholesterol, you may develop increased side effects. For more specific information on the kinds of health problems you could have if you drink grapefruit juice while taking a certain medicine, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. You can take steps to avoid problems with grapefruit juice and your medicine. Before you take any medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist if you can safely drink grapefruit juice. Read the labels on foods and natural health products to make sure they do not contain grapefruit, grapefruit juice, or grapefruit extract. Seville oranges (which are sometimes used in marmalade but not in orange juice), pomelos, and tangelos may also cause problems.3 Always read the warning labels for any medicine you are taking. Tell your doctor if you are having unusual or uncomfortable side effects from your medicine. Tell your doctor and other health professionals about all the medicines you are taking."], [1802, "Granuloma Fungoides", "Mycosis Fungoides is a rare form of T-cell lymphoma of the skin (cutaneous); the disease is typically slowly progressive and chronic.

A goiter may be a temporary problem that will remedy itself over time without medical intervention, or a symptom of another, possibly severe, thyroid condition that requires medical attention. Much more rarely, the problem may arise when the pituitary gland stimulates thyroid growth to boost production of the hormone. Another type of thyroid growth, called a sporadic goiter, can form if your diet includes too many goiter-promoting foods, such as soybeans, rutabagas, cabbage, peaches, peanuts, and spinach. These foods can suppress the manufacture of thyroid hormone by interfering with your thyroid's ability to process iodide.

All of the glycogen storage diseases are characterized by the inability to break down glycogen, but in each case this occurs for a different reason. The clinical features of GSD-V are exercise intolerance, muscle cramping, and dark, burgundy-colored urine due to the presence of myoglobin (myoglobinuria)."], [1808, "Glycogen Storage Disease IV", "Summary Andersen disease belongs to a group of rare genetic disorders of glycogen metabolism, known as glycogen storage diseases. Glycogen storage diseases are characterized by deficiencies of certain enzymes involved in the metabolism of glycogen, leading to an accumulation of abnormal forms or amounts of glycogen in various parts of the body, particularly the liver and muscle. It is caused by deficient activity of the glycogen-branching enzyme, resulting in accumulation of abnormal glycogen in the liver, muscle, and/or other tissues. Such features typically include failure to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive) and abnormal enlargement of the liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly).

Methyl sulfonylmethane (MSM) is another supplement used to ease the pain of arthritis, but it has not been through as much scientific testing. Your doctor can review the other medications you are taking and help you decide whether or not these arthritis supplements are right for you. There are conflicting studies on glucosamine and chondroitin, some demonstrating a beneficial effect on osteoarthritis pain. Others, including the NIH-sponsored multicenter Glucosamine/Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT), did not show benefit for the primary outcome of reducing pain. The supplements, which are available in pharmacies and health food stores without a prescription, are well-tolerated and appear to be safe. Keep in mind that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates supplements, but treats them like food rather than drugs; supplement manufacturers are not required to prove their products are safe or effective before selling them in the marketplace. Many physicians may still recommend a trial of glucosamine at this point, and if there is not apparent improvement by three months, it would be reasonable to stop glucosamine. There are many different brands of glucosamine and chondroitin, which are usually sold together as one arthritis supplement. In order to assure that you get a consistent dose of the supplements, stick with a reputable manufacturer; choose products sold by large and well-established companies. These arthritis supplements may also have a blood-thinning effect, so people taking these supplements in addition to an anticoagulant may have to have their blood tested more often. People who are allergic to shellfish also should consult their doctors before using glucosamine and chondroitin. The effects of these supplements on a growing child or developing baby are not yet known. For that reason, glucosamine and chondroitin are not recommended for children, women who are pregnant, women who are nursing, and women who could become pregnant. The most commonly reported side effects of glucosamine and chondroitin include: Nausea Diarrhea or constipation Heartburn Increased intestinal gas MSM, or methylsulfonylmethane, is a supplement that is used to try to help a wide range of conditions, including arthritis, allergies, and even snoring. While MSM is found in many foods -- including meat, fish, certain fruit, vegetables, and grains -- it is destroyed when foods are processed. Although some studies have reported improvement in pain with MSM, more research needs to be done to support its use as an arthritis supplement. Those patients with multiple health conditions should be aware that current prescription medication may interact with dietary supplements, and they should consult their doctor so that side effects can be best monitored. Moreover, as with many supplements that have not been studied, the long-term benefits and safety of the chemical are unknown. MSM is considered very safe, and side effects are rare. Side effects that have been reported include: Diarrhea Skin rash Headache Fatigue"], [1811, "Glaucoma", "The increased pressure, called intraocular pressure, can damage the optic nerve, which transmits images to your brain. If the damage continues, glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. Most people with glaucoma have no early symptoms or pain. You need to see your eye doctor regularly so she can diagnose and treat glaucoma before long-term visual loss happens. If you're over age 40 and have a family history of the disease, you should get a complete eye exam from an eye doctor every 1 to 2 years. If you have health problems like diabetes or a family history of glaucoma or are at risk for other eye diseases, you may need to go more often. This happens when the liquid in the front part of the eye doesn't circulate the way it should. Normally, the fluid, called aqueous humor, flows out of your eye through a mesh-like channel. The reason for the blockage is unknown, but doctors do know it can be inherited, meaning it's passed from parents to children. Less common causes include a blunt or chemical injury to your eye, severe eye infection, blocked blood vessels inside the eye, and inflammatory conditions. Your doctor may also call it wide-angle glaucoma. The drain structure in your eye -- it's called the trabecular meshwork -- looks normal, but fluid doesn't flow out like it should. You may also hear it called acute or chronic angle-closure or narrow-angle glaucoma. This can cause a sudden buildup of pressure in your eye. It's also linked to farsightedness and cataracts, a clouding of the lens inside your eye. African-Americans tend to get it more often, when they're younger, and with greater vision loss. You're more likely to get it if you: Are of African-American, Irish, Russian, Japanese, Hispanic, Inuit, or Scandinavian descent Are over 40 Have a family history of glaucoma Have poor vision Have diabetes Take certain steroid medications, like prednisone Have had trauma to the eye or eyes Most people don't have any. The first sign is often a loss of peripheral, or side, vision. That's why glaucoma is often called the \"sneak thief of vision.\" Occasionally, pressure inside the eye can rise to severe levels. In these cases, you may have sudden eye pain, headache, blurred vision, or the appearance of halos around lights. If you have any of the following symptoms, seek immediate medical care: Seeing halos around lights Vision loss Redness in the eye Eye that looks hazy (particularly in infants) Nausea or vomiting Eye pain Narrowed vision (tunnel vision) Your eye doctor will use drops to open (he'll call it dilate) your pupils. He'll check your optic nerve, and if you have glaucoma, it will look a certain way. He'll do a test called tonometry to check your eye pressure. He'll also do a visual field test, if necessary, to figure out if you've lost your side, or peripheral, vision. Your doctor may use prescription eye drops, laser surgery, or microsurgery. These either reduce the formation of fluid in the eye or increase its outflow. Side effects may include allergies, redness, stinging, blurred vision, and irritated eyes. Be sure to tell your doctor about any other medications you're taking or are allergic to. Procedures include: Trabeculoplasty: Opens the drainage area Iridotomy: Makes a tiny hole in the iris to let fluid flow more freely Cyclophotocoagulation: Treats areas of the middle layer of your eye to reduce fluid production Microsurgery. In an procedure called a trabeculectomy, the doctor creates a new channel to drain the fluid and ease eye pressure. Doctors in the U.S. tend to start with medications, but there's evidence that early laser surgery or microsurgery could work better for some people. Infant or congenital glaucoma -- meaning you are born with it -- is primarily treated with surgery, because the cause of the problem is a very distorted drainage system.

Symptoms of classic Fabry disease typically include onset in childhood or adolescence, the appearance of clusters of rash-like discolorations on the skin (angiokeratomas), excruciating pain in the hands and feet, and abdominal pain, absent or markedly decreased sweating (anhidrosis or hypohidrosis), and specific changes in the cornea of the eye (corneal dystrophy) that do not affect vision. Later in the course of the disease, kidney failure, heart disease, and/or strokes cause life-threatening complications. Individuals with alpha-galactosidase A levels greater than 1% of normal have a somewhat milder or attenuated, later-onset subtype of the disease, and typically do not have the early-onset symptoms including the skin lesions, eye changes, decreased sweating, and pain in the extremities.

In the early stage of gingivitis, bacteria in plaque build up, causing the gums to become inflamed and to easily bleed during tooth brushing. Although the gums may be irritated, the teeth are still firmly planted in their sockets. In a person with periodontitis, the inner layer of the gum and bone pull away from the teeth and form pockets. As the disease progresses, the pockets deepen and more gum tissue and bone are destroyed. These include: Hormonal changes, such as those occurring during pregnancy, puberty, menopause, and monthly menstruation, make gums more sensitive, which makes it easier for gingivitis to develop. Because diabetes affects the body's ability to use blood sugar, patients with this disease are at higher risk of developing infections, including periodontal disease and cavities. Medications can affect oral health, because some lessen the flow of saliva, which has a protective effect on teeth and gums. Family history of dental disease can be a contributing factor for the development of gingivitis. Gum disease may progress painlessly, producing few obvious signs, even in the late stages of the disease. Although the symptoms of periodontal disease often are subtle, the condition is not entirely without warning signs. The symptoms of gum disease include: Gums that bleed during and after tooth brushing Red, swollen, or tender gums Persistent bad breath or bad taste in the mouth Receding gums Formation of deep pockets between teeth and gums Loose or shifting teeth Changes in the way teeth fit together upon biting down, or in the fit of partial dentures. In some people, gum disease may affect only certain teeth, such as the molars. During a dental exam, your dentist typically checks for these things: Gum bleeding, swelling, firmness, and pocket depth (the space between the gum and tooth; the larger and deeper the pocket, the more severe the disease) Teeth movement and sensitivity and proper teeth alignment Your jawbone, to help detect the breakdown of bone surrounding your teeth The goals of gum disease treatment are to promote reattachment of healthy gums to teeth; reduce swelling, the depth of pockets, and the risk of infection; and to stop disease progression. Treatment options depend on the stage of disease, how you may have responded to earlier treatments, and your overall health. A full description of the various treatment options is provided in Gum Disease Treatments. Gingivitis can be reversed and the progression of gum disease can be stopped in nearly all cases when proper plaque control is practiced. Brushing eliminates plaque from the surfaces of the teeth that can be reached; flossing removes food particles and plaque from in between the teeth and under the gum line. Antibacterial mouth rinses can reduce bacteria that cause plaque and gum disease, according to the American Dental Association. Other health and lifestyle changes that will decrease the risk, severity, and speed of gum disease development include: Stop smoking. Smokers are seven times more likely to get gum disease than nonsmokers, and smoking can lower the chances of success of some treatments. Eating foods with antioxidant properties -- for example, those containing vitamin E ( vegetable oils, nuts, green leafy vegetables) and vitamin C (citrus fruits, broccoli, potatoes) -- can help your body repair damaged tissue. These actions may put excess force on the supporting tissues of the teeth and could increase the rate at which these tissues are destroyed. Despite following good oral hygiene practices and making other healthy lifestyle choices, the American Academy of Periodontology says that up to 30% of Americans may be genetically susceptible to gum disease. And those who are genetically predisposed may be up to six times more likely to develop some form of gum disease. If anyone in your family has gum disease, it may mean that you are at greater risk, as well. If you are more susceptible to gum disease, your dentist or periodontist may recommend more frequent check-ups, cleanings, and treatments to better manage the condition. According to the CDC, researchers have uncovered potential links between gum disease and other serious health conditions. Diabetes is not only a risk factor for gum disease, but gum disease may make diabetes worse."], [1821, "Gillespie Syndrome", "Aniridia, cerebellar ataxia, and mental deficiency, also known as Gillespie syndrome, is an extremely rare inherited disorder that is characterized by the absence, in whole (aniridia) or in part (partial aniridia), of the colored portion (iris) of the eye; impaired coordination of voluntary movements due to underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the brain's cerebellum (cerebellar ataxia); and mental retardation.

The illness, also called giardia (say \"jee-AR-dee-uh\"), is most often a problem in undeveloped countries where tap water is not safe. You may become infected with giardia if you eat food or drink water that is tainted with human or animal waste. In the United States and Canada, you can get giardia by drinking untreated water from wells, streams, rivers, and lakes. This is true even in mountain lakes and streams where the water may seem very pure. The infection can also happen if you swallow contaminated water while you swim. You can get giardia from someone else through: Close contact with someone who is infected. For example, if you change a diaper and don't wash your hands afterward, anything or anyone you touch could get infected. You could even get the illness yourself if you touch your mouth or eat food that you've touched. Giardia can cause diarrhea, stomach cramps, gas, and nausea. After a person is exposed to the parasite, it usually takes 7 to 10 days for the infection to develop, but it can take from 3 to 25 days or longer. You can pass the infection to others during the entire time you are infected. You may be infected for months, even if you don't have symptoms. Treatment also lowers the chance that you will pass giardia to others. In some situations, you may be tested for giardiasis even though you don't have any symptoms. If tests show that you are infected, your doctor may recommend that you get treatment even if you don't have symptoms. If you have diarrhea, try eating small amounts of bland food until you feel better. But you need to take frequent sips of clear fluids like rehydration drinks to avoid dehydration. If you have this problem, avoid these foods for at least 1 month. If you are camping or hiking, boil or purify water from lakes and streams before you drink it. When you travel in high-risk areas, drink bottled water and avoid raw fruits and vegetables. Wash your hands often to prevent getting giardiasis from an infected person.

Giant cell arteritis is closely related to polymyalgia rheumatica, another inflammatory disorder. These two disorders have been described in the medical literature as possible variants of the same disease process."], [1827, "Gianotti Crosti Syndrome", "Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome is a rare skin disease affecting children between the ages of nine months and nine years. Major symptoms may include blisters on the skin of the legs, buttocks and arms."], [1828, "GHD", "Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is a rare disorder characterized by the inadequate secretion of growth hormone (GH) from the anterior pituitary gland, a small gland located at the base of the brain that is responsible for the production of several hormones. GHD can be present from birth (congenital), resulting from genetic mutations or from structural defects in the brain. It results in growth retardation, short stature, and maturation delays reflected by the delay of lengthening of the bones of the extremities that is inappropriate to the chronological age of the child. Adult-onset GHD is most often is acquired from a pituitary tumor or trauma to the brain but may also be idiopathic. It is characterized by a number of variable symptoms including reduced energy levels, altered body composition, osteoporosis (reduced bone mineral density), reduced muscle strength, lipid abnormalities such as increased LDL cholesterol, insulin resistance, and impaired cardiac function. However, it is recommended that children be retested for GHD when they transition from pediatric to adult care since GH levels may normalize upon reaching adulthood. The level of GH considered normal for an adult is much lower than that for a child, especially one undergoing the pubertal growth spurt."], [1829, "Gaucher Disease", "If you just found out that you or your child has Gaucher's disease, it's natural to have lots of questions and concerns about what to expect. It's a rare condition that can cause a variety of symptoms, from weakening of your bones to easy bruising. Although there's no cure, it's important to keep in mind that depending on which type you have, treatment can help you manage some of the symptoms. Gaucher's causes problems with the way your body gets rid of a certain kind of fat. With all types of this disease, an enzyme you need to break it down doesn't work right. The fat builds up, especially in your liver, spleen, and bone marrow, causing problems. Type 1 is the most common. There are several treatments for type 1. Type 2 and type 3 are more serious. Type 3 also causes damage to the brain and spinal cord, but symptoms usually show up later in childhood. Gaucher's disease can have many symptoms, including a swollen belly, bruising, and bleeding. Your blood might not clot well, or you might get anemia. It can also cause bone mineral loss that leads to pain and easily broken bones. Whether you have the disease or you're the parent of a child who has it, it's important to get support to help you face the challenges ahead. Reach out to your family and friends to get the backing you need. Ask your doctor about how to join a support group, where you can meet other people who are going through the same things you are. Gaucher's disease isn't something you \"catch,\" like a cold or the flu. You get the disease when both of your parents pass along a damaged GBA gene to you. You can pass a faulty gene on to your children even if you don't have Gaucher's disease. Symptoms of type 1 can appear at any time in your life, but they usually show up by the teen years. Some symptoms you might have are: Easy bruising Nosebleeds Fatigue Enlarged spleen or liver, which makes your belly look swollen Bone problems like pain, breaks, or arthritis Type 2. The symptoms include: Slow back-and-forth eye movement Not gaining weight or growing as expected, called \"failure to thrive\" High-pitched sound when breathing Seizures Brain damage, especially to the brain stem Enlarged liver or spleen Type 3. The symptoms are similar to type 2, but they usually show up later in childhood and take longer to get worse. These symptoms are overwhelming for a newborn: Too much fluid in the baby's body before or soon after he's born Dry, scaly skin and other skin problems Enlarged liver and spleen Severe brain and spinal cord problems Cardiovascular Gaucher's disease (type 3C). You might have symptoms like: Hardening of the heart valves and blood vessels Bone disease Enlarged spleen Eye problems When you go to your doctor, he might ask: When did you notice your symptoms? If your doctor thinks it's Gaucher's disease, he can confirm that with a blood test. You may have an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan to see if your liver or spleen is swollen. You might also get a bone density test to check for any loss of bone. When Gaucher's disease runs in your family, blood or saliva tests can help you find out if you could pass the disease to your child. Enzyme replacement therapy is one option for people who have type 1 and some with type 3. It helps reduce anemia and shrinks an enlarged spleen or liver. Enzyme replacement therapy medications may include: Imiglucerase (Cerezyme) Taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso) Velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV) Other medications for type 1 are eliglustat (Cerdelga) and miglustat (Zavesca). They are pills that curb the process in your body that forms the fatty materials when you have an enzyme shortage. There's no treatment that can stop type 3 from causing damage to the brain, but researchers are always looking for new ways to fight the disease. Other treatments that can help your symptoms are: Blood transfusions for anemia Medications to strengthen your bones, prevent the buildup of fat, and ease pain Joint replacement surgery to help you move better Surgery to remove a swollen spleen Stem cell transplant to reverse type 1 symptoms. Because the disease is different for each person, you'll need to work with your doctor to make sure you're getting the right care. Treatment can help you feel better and might help you live longer. They often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for you. Depending on your symptoms, you may need to avoid contact sports or limit your activity. For example, wheelchairs or crutches can help when you're having trouble walking. If you have severe symptoms, you may need regular help and might not be able to live alone. Whether you have the disease or are caring for someone who has it, this is a tough condition to manage. When you get the support of others who face the same challenges, it can help you feel less isolated. Sharing information and tips can help make your daily life easier. It might also help you manage your feelings and frustrations about living with Gaucher's disease. You can get information on resources and support groups from the National Gaucher Foundation. The organization has a mentor program that lets you connect with others who have the disease to share experiences and ideas for living with your condition."], [1830, "Gastroschisis", "Typically there is a small abdominal cavity with herniated abdominal organs that usually appear on the right side of the abdomen. There is no membranous sac covering the organs and the intestines may be swollen and look shortened due to exposure to the liquid that surrounds the fetus during pregnancy (amniotic fluid)."], [1831, "Gastroparesis", "Gastroparesis is a condition in which your stomach cannot empty itself of food in a normal fashion. It can be caused by damage to the vagus nerve, which regulates the digestive system. A damaged vagus nerve prevents the muscles in the stomach and intestine from functioning, preventing food from moving through the digestive system properly. However, the causes of gastroparesis can include: Uncontrolled diabetes Gastric surgery with injury to the vagus nerve Medications such as narcotics and some antidepressants Parkinson's disease Multiple sclerosis Rare conditions such as: amyloidosis (deposits of protein fibers in tissues and organs) and scleroderma (a connective tissue disorder that affects the skin, blood vessels, skeletal muscles, and internal organs) There are many symptoms of gastroparesis, including: Heartburn or GERD Nausea Vomiting undigested food Feeling full quickly when eating Abdominal bloating Poor appetite and weight loss Poor blood sugar control Some of the complications of gastroparesis include: Food that stays in the stomach too long can ferment, which can lead to the growth of bacteria. Bezoars can cause obstructions in the stomach that keep food from passing into the small intestine. People who have both diabetes and gastroparesis may have more difficulty because blood sugar levels rise when food finally leaves the stomach and enters the small intestine, making blood sugar control more of a challenge. He or she will also give you a physical exam and may order certain blood tests, including blood sugar levels. Other tests used to diagnose and evaluate gastroparesis may include: Barium X-ray : You drink a liquid (barium), which coats the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine and shows up on X-ray. Radioisotope gastric-emptying scan (gastric scintigraphy): You eat food that contains a very small amount of radioisotope (a radioactive substance), then lie under a scanning machine; if the scan shows that more than 10% of food is still in your stomach 4 hours after eating, you are diagnosed with gastroparesis. Gastric manometry: A thin tube that is passed through your mouth and into the stomach measures the stomach's electrical and muscular activity to determine the rate of digestion. Upper endoscopy : This procedure involves passing a thin tube (endoscope) down the esophagus to examine the lining of the stomach. Some patients may benefit from medications, including: Reglan (metoclopramide): You take this drug before eating and it causes the stomach muscles to contract and move food along. Side effects include diarrhea, drowsiness, anxiety, and, rarely, a serious neurological disorder. Erythromycin: This is an antibiotic that also causes stomach contractions and helps move food out. Side effects include diarrhea and development of resistant bacteria from prolonged exposure to the antibiotic. People who have diabetes should try to control their blood sugar levels to minimize the problems of gastroparesis. One of the best ways to help control the symptoms of gastroparesis is to modify your daily eating habits. In this way, there is less food in the stomach; you won't feel as full, and it will be easier for the food to leave your stomach. Another important factor is the consistency of food; liquids and low residue foods are encouraged (for example, applesauce should replace whole apples with intact skins). You should also avoid foods that are high in fat (which can slow down digestion) and fiber (which is difficult to digest). Using an instrument through a small incision, botulinum toxin (such as Botox) can be injected into the pylorus, the valve that leads from the stomach to the small intestine. This can relax the valve, keeping it open for a longer period of time to allow the stomach to empty. Electrical gastric stimulation for gastroparesis uses electrodes that are attached to the stomach wall and, when stimulated, trigger stomach contractions."], [1832, "Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors", "Tumors usually arise from the intestinal tract with the most common site being the stomach, followed by the small intestine, and then the colon/rectum with rare cases arising in the esophagus. There are also tumors that appear to arise in the membranous tissue lining the wall of the stomach (peritoneum) or in a fold of such membranous tissue (the omentum). They spread most commonly to sites within the abdominal cavity and to the liver, although there are rare cases of spread to the lungs and bone. Some GISTs are noncancerous (benign) and do not spread (indolent); others are aggressive with extensive local invasion as well as distant metastases. Most cases result from a change (mutation) in one of two genes, KIT or PDGFR, which leads to continued growth and division of tumor cells. There are a few reported cases of families in which a gene mutation is inherited; however, the majority of tumors occur randomly for no apparent reason (sporadically) and not inherited (acquired mutation). Approximately 10-15% of cases of GIST in adults and 85% of cases in children are not associated with mutations in either the KIT or PDGFR genes. Introduction GISTs were initially believed to be a single entity, but recent research has shown that there are several molecular subtypes with different characteristics including different prognoses, clinical symptoms, and different associated genes. Sarcomas are malignant tumors that arise from the connective tissue, which connects, supports, and surrounds various structures and organs in the body.

That happens if a valve at the top of the stomach doesn't work properly. If it happens often, you may have a more serious condition called GERD. Left untreated, GERD can sometimes lead to other problems, including: Inflammation and ulcers in the esophagus Hoarseness Lung disease Barrett's esophagus -- a change in the lining of the esophagus that makes you more likely to get esophageal cancer You may have: A burning feeling in your chest just behind the breastbone that happens after you eat and lasts a few minutes to several hours Chest pain, especially after bending over, lying down, or eating Burning in the throat -- or a hot, sour, acidic, or salty-tasting fluid at the back of the throat Trouble swallowing Feeling of food \"sticking\" in the middle of your chest or throat You are more likely to get heartburn if you: Eat large portions Eat certain foods, including onions, chocolate, peppermint, high-fat or spicy foods, citrus fruits, garlic, and tomatoes or tomato-based products Drink citrus juices, alcohol, caffeinated drinks, and carbonated beverages Eat before bedtime Are overweight Smoke Wear tight-fitting clothing or belts Lie down or bend over after eating Are stressed out Are pregnant Have a hiatal hernia, meaning that part of your stomach bulges up into your chest Take certain medications, especially some antibiotics and NSAIDS, including aspirin Are constipated Try these tips to help relieve, lessen, or prevent heartburn: Raise the head of your bed about 6 inches. This helps gravity keep your stomach's contents in your stomach. Doing so puts your body into a bent position that actually makes the condition worse. Instead, put blocks or bricks under the legs of the bed to raise it up. Eat meals at least 3 to 4 hours before lying down, and don't eat bedtime snacks. Limit fatty foods, chocolate, peppermint, coffee, tea, colas, and alcohol. Limit tomatoes and citrus fruits or juices. Ask your doctor if you need to try an \"elimination diet\" to find other foods that bother you. On an elimination diet, you stop eating certain foods to find out if they cause a problem. \"Over the counter\" or OTC medicines are ones you don't need a prescription for. These medicines neutralize extra stomach acid to relieve heartburn, sour stomach, acid indigestion, and an upset stomach. Take them exactly how your doctor tells you to, or follow the directions on the label. If you accidentally take too much or use them too often, you can have side effects. They can include constipation, diarrhea, change in the color of bowel movements, and stomach cramps. These drugs ease heartburn, acid indigestion, and sour stomach. They cut down on how much acid your stomach makes. When in doubt, ask your doctor or a pharmacist. Examples of acid blockers include: Esomeprazole (Nexium) Famotidine (Pepcid AC) Lansoprazole (Prevacid) Nizatidine (Axid) Omeprazole (Prilosec) Pantoprazole (Protonix) Ranitidine (Zantac) Tell your doctor right away if you have confusion, chest tightness, bleeding, sore throat, fever, irregular heartbeat, weakness, or unusual fatigue. Get immediate medical attention if you have any chest pain, pressure, or burning that doesn't go away (even with medications and lifestyle changes). Also get medical help right away if you are vomiting blood or what looks like dark coffee grounds. See a doctor immediately if your stools are black, bloody, or a maroon color. If your heartburn is severe and over-the-counter medicines don't help, or if you have taken them for more than 2 weeks, call your doctor. Also see your doctor if you are losing weight without trying or having trouble swallowing. Your doctor can check to see what is causing the problem and what the best solution will be for you. It's rare, but you may need an operation if: Other treatments haven't helped. The muscle that controls the valve at the top of your stomach doesn't work properly.

There is considerable confusion and contradiction in the medical literature regarding disorders involving large gastric folds. However, Menetrier disease is not a true form of gastritis. A diagnosis of Menetrier disease should indicate massive overgrowth of mucous cells (foveola) in the gastric mucosa (foveolar hyperplasia) and minimal inflammation. Foveolar hyperplasia results in large gastric folds.

Bile reflux: A backflow of bile into the stomach from the bile tract (that connects to the liver and gallbladder) Infections caused by bacteria and viruses If gastritis is left untreated, it can lead to a severe loss of blood and may increase the risk of developing stomach cancer. However, the most common symptoms include: Nausea or recurrent upset stomach Abdominal bloating Abdominal pain Vomiting Indigestion Burning or gnawing feeling in the stomach between meals or at night Hiccups Loss of appetite Vomiting blood or coffee ground-like material Black, tarry stools To diagnose gastritis, your doctor will review your personal and family medical history, perform a thorough physical evaluation, and may recommend any of the following tests: Upper endoscopy. An endoscope, a thin tube containing a tiny camera, is inserted through your mouth and down into your stomach to look at the stomach lining. The doctor will check for inflammation and may perform a biopsy, a procedure in which a tiny sample of tissue is removed and then sent to a laboratory for analysis. The doctor may perform various blood tests, such as checking your red blood cell count to determine whether you have anemia, which means that you do not have enough red blood cells. This test checks for the presence of blood in your stool, a possible sign of gastritis. Treatment for gastritis usually involves: Taking antacids and other drugs (such as proton pump inhibitors or H-2 blockers) to reduce stomach acid Avoiding hot and spicy foods For gastritis caused by H. pylori infection, your doctor will prescribe a regimen of several antibiotics plus an acid blocking drug (used for heartburn) If the gastritis is caused by pernicious anemia, B12 vitamin shots will be given."], [1838, "Giant Cell Glioblastoma, Multiforme", "Although there is no cure, there are treatments to help ease symptoms. Glioblastoma is a type of astrocytoma, a cancer that forms from star-shaped cells in the brain called astrocytes. In adults, this cancer usually starts in the cerebrum, the largest part of your brain. Glioblastoma tumors make their own blood supply, which helps them grow. From 2009 to 2013, doctors diagnosed nearly 11,000 glioblastoma cases in the U.S. each year. Because glioblastomas grow quickly, pressure on the brain usually causes the first symptoms. Depending on where the tumor is, it can cause: Constant headaches Seizures Vomiting Trouble thinking Changes in mood or personality Double or blurred vision Trouble speaking A neurologist (a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating brain disorders) will give you a complete exam. The goal of glioblastoma treatment is to slow and control tumor growth and help you live as comfortably and as well as possible. There are four treatments, and many people get more than one type: Surgery is the first treatment. Temozolomide is the most common chemotherapy drug doctors use for glioblastoma. Chemo can cause short-term side effects, but it's much less toxic than it used to be. Electric field therapy uses electrical fields to target cells in the tumor while not hurting normal cells. The FDA has approved it for both newly diagnosed people and people whose glioblastoma has come back. At major cancer centers, you may also be able to get experimental treatments or oral chemotherapy, which you take at home. These treatments may help with symptoms and possibly put the cancer into remission in some people. In remission, symptoms may let up or disappear for a time. Glioblastomas often regrow. If that happens, doctors may be able to treat it with surgery and a different form of radiation and chemotherapy. You may also want to ask your doctor if there's a clinical trial that would be a good fit for you. Many things can affect how well someone does when they have cancer, including glioblastomas. But they do have statistics that track how large groups of people who've had these conditions tend to do over time. For glioblastoma, the survival rates are: One year: 39.3% Two years: 16.9% Three years: 9.9% Four years: 7.0% Five years: 5.5% Ten years: 2.9% Younger people tend to fare the best."], [1839, "Gastric Cancer", "Gastric cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lining of the stomach. It is part of the digestive system, which processes nutrients (vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and water) in foods that are eaten and helps pass waste material out of the body. The wall of the stomach is made up of 3 layers of tissue: the mucosal (innermost) layer, the muscularis (middle) layer, and the serosal (outermost) layer. Gastric cancer begins in the cells lining the mucosal layer and spreads through the outer layers as it grows. Stromal tumors of the stomach begin in supporting connective tissue and are treated differently from gastric cancer. For more information about cancers of the stomach, see the following PDQ summaries: Unusual Cancers of Childhood Stomach (Gastric) Cancer Prevention Stomach (Gastric) Cancer Screening Age, diet, and stomach disease can affect the risk of developing gastric cancer. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Risk factors for gastric cancer include the following: Having any of the following medical conditions:Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection of the stomach.Chronic gastritis (inflammation of the stomach).Pernicious anemia.Intestinal metaplasia (a condition in which the normal stomach lining is replaced with the cells that line the intestines).Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or gastric polyps.

Symptoms of gastric cancer include indigestion and stomach discomfort or pain. In the early stages of gastric cancer, the following symptoms may occur: Indigestion and stomach discomfort. In more advanced stages of gastric cancer, the following signs and symptoms may occur: Blood in the stool. Tests that examine the stomach and esophagus are used to detect (find) and diagnose gastric cancer. The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that produces it. Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells. The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells. Upper endoscopy: A procedure to look inside the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum (first part of the small intestine) to check for abnormal areas. An endoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is passed through the mouth and down the throat into the esophagus. A thin, lighted tube is inserted through the mouth to look for abnormal areas in the esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine. Barium swallow : A series of x-rays of the esophagus and stomach. The patient drinks a liquid that contains barium (a silver-white metallic compound). CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. A biopsy of the stomach is usually done during the endoscopy.One or more of the following tests may be done on the samples of tissue that are removed: Immunohistochemistry: A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer.FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization): A laboratory technique used to look at genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues. Pieces of DNA that contain a fluorescent dye are made in the laboratory and added to cells or tissues on a glass slide. The sample of blood or bone marrow is checked for HER2/neu to help decide the best treatment. Immunohistochemistry: A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue.

People with Ganser syndrome mimic behavior that is typical of a mental illness, such as schizophrenia. People with factitious disorders act this way because of an inner need to be seen as ill or injured -- not to achieve a clear benefit, such as financial gain. They are even willing to undergo painful or risky tests and operations in order to obtain the sympathy and special attention given to people who are truly ill. Factitious disorders are technically considered mental illnesses because they are associated with severe emotional difficulties. People with Ganser syndrome have short-term episodes of odd behavior similar to that shown by people with other serious mental illnesses. The person may appear confused, make absurd statements, and report hallucinations such as the experience of sensing things that are not there or hearing voices. Most people with this disorder also have a personality disorder, usually antisocial personality disorder or histrionic personality disorder. For people with histrionic personality disorder, their self-esteem depends on the approval of others and does not arise from a true feeling of self-worth. They have an overwhelming desire to be noticed, and often behave dramatically or inappropriately to get attention. It is more common in men than in women and most often occurs in the late teens and early adult years. If the doctor finds no physical reason for the symptoms, he or she may refer the person to a psychiatrist or psychologist, mental health professionals who are specially trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses. Psychiatrists and psychologists use specially designed interviews and assessment tools to evaluate a person for a factitious disorder. The doctor bases his or her diagnosis on the exclusion of actual physical or mental illness and his or her observation of the patient's attitude and behavior. The person may need to be hospitalized if the symptoms are extreme and/or if the person could be dangerous. It is difficult to predict whether and when symptoms of Ganser syndrome are likely to go away. This is partly because people with Ganser Syndrome often present with fake symptoms not just simply in response to a stressful event, but because the condition often reflects someone's limited ability to cope effectively with stresses when they occur. Medication usually is not used, unless the person also suffers from depression, anxiety, or certain kinds of personality disorders. The likelihood for recovery from Ganser syndrome can vary greatly depending on whether the symptoms arose suddenly in response to a stressful experience or reflect a more long-term pattern of maladaptive behavior related to an underlying personality disorder."], [1843, "Gangliosidosis GM2 Type 2", "Tay-Sachs disease is a rare, neurodegenerative disorder in which deficiency of an enzyme (hexosaminidase A) results in excessive accumulation of certain fats (lipids) known as gangliosides in the brain and nerve cells. Symptoms associated with Tay-Sachs disease may include an exaggerated startle response to sudden noises, listlessness, loss of previously acquired skills (i.e., psychomotor regression), and severely diminished muscle tone (hypotonia). With disease progression, affected infants and children may develop cherry-red spots within the middle layer of the eyes, gradual loss of vision, and deafness, increasing muscle stiffness and restricted movements (spasticity), eventual paralysis, uncontrolled electrical disturbances in the brain (seizures), and deterioration of cognitive processes (dementia). The classical form of Tay-Sachs disease occurs during infancy; an adult form (late-onset Tay-Sachs disease) may occur anytime from adolescence to the mid 30's.

A ganglion can grow out of a joint capsule, which surrounds the joint, or a tendon sheath, which covers the tendon (the fibers connecting muscle to bone). Ganglions aren't cancerous. Bumps may be very small or bigger than a cherry. Ganglions may get bigger as activity increases and more fluid collects in the sac. They may also shrink and may break and go away on their own. Anyone can get a ganglion: adults between 15 and 40 years old are most likely to be affected.1 Children don't usually have ganglions, but if they do, the ganglion will very likely go away without any treatment. Experts don't know the exact cause of ganglions. They may be linked to: Inflammation or irritation of the tendon sheath or joint capsule. Ganglions are usually small, painless bumps and do not cause other symptoms. Sometimes the bump can be tender to the touch, or there can be pain that gets worse with activity or pressure. If the ganglion puts pressure on nearby nerves, you may have tingling in your fingers, hand, or forearm. A ganglion can usually be diagnosed based on how it looks and where it is. Your doctor will also feel the bump and shine a light alongside it. If the bump is a ganglion, the light usually shines through it. Some of the fluid found in the ganglion may be removed and examined. Ganglions usually don't need treatment, and they often go away on their own. But treatment may be needed if the ganglion causes pain or other symptoms, limits what you can do, affects your bones or ligaments, or gets infected. Your doctor may treat a ganglion by: Giving you a wrist or finger splint to wear. With or without treatment, ganglions may come and go and may get bigger or smaller. This may be all that is needed for the ganglion to shrink and disappear on its own. Numbness, tingling, pain, or coolness in your hand are signs that you need to loosen the splint. You may break a bone or otherwise injure your wrist by trying this folk remedy, and the ganglion may return anyway. Do not try to drain the fluid by poking the ganglion with a pin or any other sharp object. If the ganglion breaks open on its own and the skin is broken:Cover the wound with a thin layer of petroleum jelly, such as Vaseline, and a nonstick bandage.Apply more petroleum jelly and replace the bandage as needed.

This disorder is characterized by abnormalities in the peripheral and central nervous systems including low muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle weakness, decreased reflexes, impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), seizures and intellectual disability. Giant axonal neuropathy follows autosomal recessive genetic inheritance."], [1846, "Gallstones", "They're pieces of solid material that form in the gallbladder, a small organ located under the liver. You might not even know you have them until they block a bile duct, causing pain that you need to get treated right away. These are usually yellow-green in color. They're the most common kind, accounting for 80% of gallstones. They're made up of bilirubin, which comes from bile, a fluid your liver makes and your gallbladder stores. There may be several reasons, including: Your genes Your weight Problems with your gallbladder Diet Bile can be part of the problem. Your body needs bile, but if it has too much cholesterol in it, that makes gallstones more likely. It can also happen if your gallbladder can't empty properly. Pigment stones are more common in people with certain medical conditions, such as cirrhosis (a liver disease) or blood diseases such as sickle cell anemia. Obesity can raise your cholesterol level and also make it harder for the gallbladder to empty completely. You take birth control pills, hormone replacement therapy for menopause symptoms, or are pregnant. It can increase cholesterol and make it harder for the gallbladder to empty. People with this condition tend to have higher levels of triglycerides (a type of blood fat), which is a risk factor for gallstones. Some of these drugs boost the amount of cholesterol in bile, which may increase your chances of getting cholesterol stones. Your liver makes extra cholesterol, which may lead to gallstones. Gallstones are also more likely if they run in your family, and they're likelier among women, older people, and some ethnic groups, including Native Americans and Mexican-Americans. You might not notice anything, or even know you have gallstones, unless your doctor tells you. But if you do get symptoms, they usually include: Pain in your upper belly and upper back that can last for several hours Nausea Vomiting Other digestive problems, including bloating, indigestion and heartburn, and gas If your doctor thinks you may have gallstones, he'll give you a physical exam. You may also get: Blood tests to check for signs of infection or obstruction, and to rule out other conditions. This quick procedure is done in your doctor's office, and it makes images of the inside of your body. Specialized X-rays allow your doctor to see inside your body, including your gallbladder. This test uses a magnetic field and pulses of radio-wave energy to make pictures of the inside of your body, including the liver and the gallbladder. Doctors inject a harmless radioactive material, which makes its way to the organ. This test combines ultrasound and endoscopy to look for gallstones. The doctor inserts an endoscope through your mouth down to the small intestine and injects a dye to allow the bile ducts to be seen. He can often then remove any gallstones that have moved into the ducts. The surgeon passes instruments, a light, and a camera through several small cuts in the belly. Afterward, you spend the night in the hospital. If gallstones are in your bile ducts, the doctor may use ERCP to find and remove them before or during gallbladder surgery. If you have a medical condition and your doctor feels you shouldn't have an operation, he may prescribe the medications chenodiol (Chenix), ursodiol (Actigall), or both. The downside of using either medication is that you may have to take it for years to completely dissolve the stones, which may come back after you stop taking the drug."], [1847, "Gallbladder Inflammation", "Cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder, a small organ near the liver that plays a part in digesting food. Normally, fluid called bile passes out of the gallbladder on its way to the small intestine. If the flow of bile is blocked, it builds up inside the gallbladder, causing swelling, pain, and possible infection. A gallstone stuck in the cystic duct , a tube that carries bile from the gallbladder, is most often the cause of sudden (acute) cholecystitis. Infection or trauma, such as an injury from a car accident, can also cause cholecystitis. Complications from another severe illness, such as HIV or diabetes, cause the swelling. Long-term (chronic) cholecystitis is another form of cholecystitis. It occurs when the gallbladder remains swollen over time, causing the walls of the gallbladder to become thick and hard. The most common symptom of cholecystitis is pain in your upper right abdomen that can sometimes move around to your back or right shoulder blade. Their only symptom may be a tender area in the abdomen. You may have blood drawn and an ultrasound, a test that uses sound waves to create a picture of your gallbladder. Ultrasound may show gallstones, thickening of the gallbladder wall, extra fluid, and other signs of cholecystitis. This test also allows doctors to check the size and shape of your gallbladder. It can also help find blockage in the tubes (bile ducts) that lead from the liver to the gallbladder and small intestine (duodenum). The main treatment for acute cholecystitis is surgery to remove the gallbladder (cholecystectomy). Often this surgery can be done through small incisions in the abdomen (laparoscopic cholecystectomy), but sometimes it requires a more extensive operation. Your doctor may try to reduce swelling and irritation in the gallbladder before removing it. Sometimes acute cholecystitis is caused by one or more gallstones getting stuck in the main tube leading to the intestine, called the common bile duct. Treatment may involve an endoscopic procedure (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, or ERCP) to remove the stones in the common bile duct before the gallbladder is removed."], [1848, "Gallbladder Cancer", "When food is being broken down in the stomach and intestines, bile is released from the gallbladder through a tube called the common bile duct, which connects the gallbladder and liver to the first part of the small intestine. Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Risk factors for gallbladder cancer include the following: Being female. Signs and symptoms of gallbladder cancer include jaundice, fever, and pain. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by gallbladder cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following: Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes). Gallbladder cancer is difficult to detect and diagnose for the following reasons: There are no signs or symptoms in the early stages of gallbladder cancer. Tests that examine the gallbladder and nearby organs are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage gallbladder cancer. Procedures that make pictures of the gallbladder and the area around it help diagnose gallbladder cancer and show how far the cancer has spread. The process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within and around the gallbladder is called staging. In order to plan treatment, it is important to know if the gallbladder cancer can be removed by surgery. Tests and procedures to detect, diagnose, and stage gallbladder cancer are usually done at the same time. The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Liver function tests : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver. A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of liver disease that may be caused by gallbladder cancer. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assay: A test that measures the level of CEA in the blood. When found in higher than normal amounts, it can be a sign of gallbladder cancer or other conditions. CA 19-9 assay: A test that measures the level of CA 19-9 in the blood. When found in higher than normal amounts, it can be a sign of gallbladder cancer or other conditions. Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that makes it. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, taken from different angles. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. PTC (percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography): A procedure used to x-ray the liver and bile ducts. If a blockage is found, a thin, flexible tube called a stent is sometimes left in the liver to drain bile into the small intestine or a collection bag outside the body. Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography): A procedure used to x-ray the ducts (tubes) that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder and from the gallbladder to the small intestine. Sometimes gallbladder cancer causes these ducts to narrow and block or slow the flow of bile, causing jaundice. An endoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is passed through the mouth, esophagus, and stomach into the first part of the small intestine. If the ducts are blocked by a tumor, a fine tube may be inserted into the duct to unblock it. This tube (or stent) may be left in place to keep the duct open. Laparoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the abdomen to check for signs of disease. Small incisions (cuts) are made in the wall of the abdomen and a laparoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is inserted into one of the incisions. Other instruments may be inserted through the same or other incisions to perform procedures such as removing organs or taking tissue samples for biopsy. The laparoscopy helps to find out if the cancer is within the gallbladder only or has spread to nearby tissues and if it can be removed by surgery. Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. If the tumor clearly cannot be removed by surgery, the biopsy may be done using a fine needle to remove cells from the tumor. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following: The stage of the cancer (whether the cancer has spread from the gallbladder to other places in the body). Treatment may also depend on the age and general health of the patient and whether the cancer is causing signs or symptoms. If the cancer has spread, palliative treatment can improve the patient's quality of life by controlling the symptoms and complications of this disease. Taking part in one of the clinical trials being done to improve treatment should be considered."], [1849, "Galactose-1-Phosphate Uridyl Transferase Deficiency", "Galactosemia is a rare, hereditary disorder of carbohydrate metabolism that affects the body's ability to convert galactose (a sugar contained in milk, including human mother's milk) to glucose (a different type of sugar).

A deficiency of this enzyme may result in the premature destruction of red blood cells (an acute hemolytic anemia or a chronic spherocytic type) when an affected individual is exposed to certain medications or chemicals, experiences certain viral or bacterial infections, and/or inhales the pollen of, or consumes, fava beans (favism). The severity of symptoms associated with G6PD Deficiency may vary greatly among affected individuals, depending upon the specific form of the disorder that is present. The role of the enzyme G6PD is to maintain the pathway to generate a chemical called glutathione, which in a particular form is an antioxidant. The antioxidant is necessary to protect the cell's hemoglobin and its cell wall (red cell membrane). If the level of antioxidant is too low, then the cell's hemoglobin will not bind oxygen (its main purpose); the cell wall will break allowing the cell contents, including the modified hemoglobin, to spill out."], [1852, "Fukuhara Syndrome", "MERRF (Myoclonus Epilepsy with Ragged-Red Fibers) syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that begins in childhood and affects the nervous system and skeletal muscle as well as other body systems.

The inability to breakdown fucose-containing compounds results in their accumulation in various tissues in the body. The symptoms and severity of fucosidosis are highly variable and the disorder represents a disease spectrum in which individuals with mild cases have been known to live into the third or fourth decades.

If you develop frostbite, you may not realize at first that anything is wrong, because the affected area may be numb. However, if severe frostbite occurs, permanent damage is possible depending on how long and how deeply the tissue was frozen.

As you age, your bones become more brittle and you are more likely to suffer fractures from falls that would not occur when you were young. In a displaced fracture, the bone snaps into two or more parts and moves so that the two ends are not lined up straight. In a non-displaced fracture, the bone cracks either part or all of the way through, but does move and maintains its proper alignment. A closed fracture is when the bone breaks but there is no puncture or open wound in the skin. An open fracture is one in which the bone breaks through the skin; it may then recede back into the wound and not be visible through the skin. Because of the unique properties of their bones, there are some defined fracture subtypes that present only in children. For example: A greenstick fracture in which the bone is bent, but not broken all the way through A buckle fracture results from compression of two bones driven into each other. A growth plate fracture at the joint that can result in shorter bone length These fracture subtypes can present in children and adults: A comminuted fracture is when the bone breaks into several pieces A transverse fracture is when the fracture line is perpendicular to the shaft (long part) of the bone. An oblique fracture is when the break is on an angle through the bone A pathologic fracture is caused by a disease that weakens the bone A stress fracture is a hairline crack The severity of a fracture depends upon the fracture subtype and location. Serious fractures can have dangerous complications if not treated promptly; possible complications include damage to blood vessels or nerves and infection of the bone (osteomyelitis) or surrounding tissue."], [1859, "Fractured Rib", "A rib fracture is a crack or break in one of the bones of the rib cage. The most common cause of a fractured rib is a direct blow to the chest, often from a car accident or a fall. This is more likely to happen if you have a disease that has made your bones weak, such as osteoporosis or cancer. They help you breathe by keeping space open inside your chest while the muscles you use to breathe squeeze in, or contract. The muscles used for breathing pull on the ribs, so breathing may be very painful when you have a fractured rib. It is important to see a doctor after a rib injury. A blow that is hard enough to fracture a rib could also injure your lungs, spleen, blood vessels, or other parts of your body. A common injury when you have a fractured rib is a punctured or collapsed lung (pneumothorax). If you have flail chest, the broken area can't hold its shape when you take a breath. This leaves less space in your chest for your lungs to open and air to flow in. It also makes it harder for the muscles to work well, so it's harder to take a breath. If you can't breathe normally because of your injuries, you may: Feel short of breath. The doctor may: Push on your chest to find out where you are hurt. Watch you breathe and listen to your lungs to make sure air is moving in and out normally. Check your head, neck, spine, and belly to make sure there are no other injuries. You may need to have an X-ray or other imaging test if your doctor isn't sure about your symptoms. Pain relief can help you feel better and let you take deeper breaths. A fractured rib usually takes at least 6 weeks to heal. While you are healing, it is important to cough or take the deepest breath you can at least once an hour. This can help prevent pneumonia or a partial collapse of the lung tissue. If you have fractured your ribs and you have not injured your neck or back, it is a good idea to lie on your injured side. This may seem odd at first, but it will let you take deeper breaths. In the past, it was common to tape or tightly wrap the injured rib area.

Then your heel or the bottom of your foot hurts when you stand or walk. Plantar fasciitis is common in middle-aged people. It also occurs in younger people who are on their feet a lot, like athletes or soldiers. Plantar fasciitis is caused by straining the ligament that supports your arch. You walk, stand, or run for long periods of time, especially on hard surfaces. You wear shoes that don't fit well or are worn out. You have tight Achilles tendons or calf muscles. Most people with plantar fasciitis have pain when they take their first steps after they get out of bed or sit for a long time. You may have less stiffness and pain after you take a few steps.

But there are many things you can try to help your foot get better: Give your feet a rest. Or take an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen (such as Advil or Motrin) or naproxen (such as Aleve). Do toe stretches , calf stretches and towel stretches several times a day, especially when you first get up in the morning.

If these treatments do not help, your doctor may recommend splints that you wear at night, shots of medicine (such as a steroid) in your heel, or other treatments. Doctors only suggest it for people who still have pain after trying other treatments for 6 to 12 months. Plantar fasciitis most often occurs because of injuries that have happened over time.

Raw foods from animals are the most likely sources of contamination. Be careful that you don't let juices or drippings from raw meat and poultry -- or for that matter shellfish and eggs -- touch other foods you plan to serve or eat. Shellfish and raw fish: Carefully pick out and cook fish and shellfish to ensure quality and freshness. Pasteurized foods are heated before being sold to kill bacteria. Avoid soft cheeses such as feta, brie, camembert, blue-veined, and Mexican-style cheese -- or other unpasteurized cheeses. Hard cheeses, processed cheeses, cream cheese, and cottage cheese are safe. Vegetables: These can also be the source of food poisoning, particularly sprouts of all kinds (alfalfa, mung, clover, and radish). Avoid raw sprouts if you are pregnant or have a weakened immune system. A couple of other food-related tips: Don't set out eggs, meats, poultry, seafood, or milk at room temperature for long. The first rule of safe cooking is to wash your hands frequently. Wash cutting boards and knives with antibacterial soap and warm to hot water after handling raw meat, poultry, seafood, or eggs. Use a clean thermometer that can tell you the inner temperature of cooked foods. That way, you can be sure meat, poultry, and other foods are cooked all the way through. Here are a few specifics on that: Cook roasts and steaks to at least 145 F. Whole poultry should be cooked to 165 F for doneness. Cook ground beef (hamburger) to at least 160 F. Ground chicken or turkey should be cooked to 165 F. Cook foods until they are steaming hot, especially leftover foods or ready-to-eat foods, such as hot dogs. Some other tips: Keep the refrigerator at 40 F or lower. Set the freezer at 0 F. Wash raw vegetables and fruits well before eating, especially those that will not be cooked. If you like to can foods at home, make sure you know the safety guidelines. Although the chance of getting food-borne disease from deli counter food is low, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems may wish to avoid these foods. If you are served an undercooked meat or egg product in a restaurant, send it back for more cooking. If you take home leftovers, refrigerate them within 2 hours. Here are some tips to avoid food poisoning no matter where you are in the world: Go for hot foods: Heat kills germs. Eat packaged or dry foods: Many of the bugs that cause food poisoning prefer moisture. Dry foods such as bread or chips or factory-sealed foods such as tuna are usually a safe bet. Go for bottled, canned, or hot drinks: Carbonated drinks are a good choice, because the bubbles will tell you it's been sealed properly. You should be good with coffee or tea if it arrives steaming hot. Wash your hands with soap after handling reptiles, turtles, birds, or after contact with human or pet feces. If you are ill with diarrhea or vomiting, do not prepare food for others, especially infants, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems, because they are more likely to get sick from an infection."], [1866, "Food Allergies", "People often have an unpleasant reaction to something they ate and wonder if they have a food allergy. One out of three people either say that they have a food allergy or that they modify the family diet because a family member is suspected of having a food allergy. In teens and adults, food allergies occur in about 4% of the total population. This difference between the clinically proven prevalence of food allergy and the public perception of the problem is in part due to reactions called \"food intolerances\" rather than food allergies. A food allergy, or hypersensitivity, is an abnormal response to a food that is triggered by the immune system. The immune system is not responsible for the symptoms of a food intolerance, even though these symptoms can resemble those of a food allergy. For example, being allergic to milk is different from not being able to digest it properly due to lactose intolerance. It is extremely important for people who have true food allergies to identify them and prevent allergic reactions to food, because these reactions can cause devastating illness and, in some cases, death. One is the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE), a type of protein called an antibody that circulates through the blood. The other is the mast cell, a specific cell that occurs in all body tissues but is especially common in areas of the body that are typical sites of allergic reactions, including the nose and throat, lungs, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. The ability of a given individual to form IgE against something as benign as food is an inherited predisposition. Generally, such people come from families in which allergies are common -- not necessarily food allergies but perhaps hay fever, asthma, or hives. Before an allergic reaction can occur, a person who is predisposed to form IgE to foods first has to be exposed to the food. The next time the person eats that food, it interacts with specific IgE on the surface of the mast cells and triggers the cells to release chemicals such as histamine. Depending upon the tissue in which they are released, these chemicals will cause a person to have various food allergy symptoms. Food allergens (the food fragments responsible for an allergic reaction) are proteins within the food that usually are not broken down by the heat of cooking or by stomach acids or enzymes that digest food. If people are allergic to a particular food, for example, they may first experience itching in the mouth as they start to eat the food. After the food is digested in the stomach, abdominal symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, or pain may start. When the food allergens enter and travel through the bloodstream, they can cause a drop in blood pressure. As the allergens reach the skin, they can induce hives or eczema, or when they reach the lungs, they may cause bronchospasm (wheezing or constriction of the lungs). In adults, the most common foods allergies include: peanuts (a legume that is one of the chief foods to cause severe anaphylaxis, a sudden drop in blood pressure that can be fatal if not treated quickly) tree nuts such as walnuts shellfish such as shrimp, crayfish, lobster, and crab In children, the food allergy pattern is somewhat different. The most common food allergens that cause problems in children are eggs, milk, and peanuts. Children are more likely to outgrow allergies to milk, eggs, or soy than allergies to peanuts, fish, or shrimp. The foods that adults or children react to are those foods they eat often. If someone has a life-threatening allergic reaction to a certain food, the doctor will counsel the patient to avoid similar foods that might trigger this reaction. For example, if someone has a history of allergy to shrimp, testing will usually show that the person is not only allergic to shrimp but also to other shellfish like crab, lobster, and crayfish. During ragweed pollination season, these people sometimes find that when they try to eat melons, particularly cantaloupe, they have itching in their mouth and they simply cannot eat the melon. Similarly, people who have severe birch pollen allergy also may react to the peel of apples. If a patient goes to the doctor's office and says, \"I think I have a food allergy,\" the doctor has to consider the list of other possibilities that may lead to symptoms that could be confused with a food allergy. One possibility is the contamination of foods with microorganisms, such as bacteria, and their products, such as toxins. There are also natural substances, such as histamine, that can occur in foods and stimulate a reaction similar to an allergic reaction. In fish, histamine is believed to stem from bacterial contamination, particularly in fish that hasn't been refrigerated properly. If someone eats one of these foods with a high level of histamine, that person may have a reaction that strongly resembles an allergic reaction to food. Another cause of food intolerance that is often confused with a food allergy is lactase deficiency, also known as lactose intolerance. If a person does not have enough lactase, the body cannot digest the lactose in most dairy products. Another type of food intolerance is an adverse reaction to certain products that are added to food to enhance taste, provide color, or protect against the growth of microorganisms. Compounds that are most frequently tied to adverse reactions that can be confused with food allergy are yellow dye number 5, monosodium glutamate, and sulfites. Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a flavor enhancer, and, when consumed in large amounts, can cause flushing, sensations of warmth, headache, facial pressure, chest pain, or feelings of detachment in some people. Such reactions led the FDA to ban sulfites as spray-on preservatives in fresh fruits and vegetables. There are several other diseases that share symptoms with food allergies, including ulcers and cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. It is caused by an abnormal immune response to gluten, which is a component of wheat and some other grains. In selected cases, a careful psychiatric evaluation may identify an unpleasant event in that person's life, often during childhood, tied to eating a particular food. The eating of that food years later, even as an adult, is associated with a rush of unpleasant sensations that can resemble an allergic reaction to food. To diagnose a food allergy a doctor must first determine if the patient is having an adverse reaction to specific foods. The doctor sits down with the person suspected of having a food allergy and takes a history to determine if the facts are consistent with a food allergy. (Antihistamines should relieve hives, for example, if they stem from a food allergy.) The severity of the patient's reaction is sometimes related to the amount of food the patient ate. In that case, the doctor may ask the patient to go back and keep a record of the contents of each meal and whether he or she had a reaction. Under the doctor's direction, the patient does not eat a food suspected of causing the allergy, like eggs, and substitutes another food, in this case, another source of protein. If the patient removes the food and the symptoms go away, the doctor can almost always make a diagnosis. If the patient then eats the food (under the doctor's direction) and the symptoms come back, then the diagnosis is confirmed. This technique cannot be used, however, if the reactions are severe (in which case the patient should not resume eating the food) or infrequent. Also thought to be helpful in diagnosing food allergies is an oral food challenge. This is done under strict medical supervision If the patient's history, diet diary, elimination diet, or oral food challenge suggests a specific food allergy is likely, the doctor may use tests that can more objectively measure an allergic response to food. One of these is a scratch puncture test, during which a dilute extract of the food is placed on the skin of the forearm or back. Skin tests are rapid, simple, and relatively safe although experts do not recommend making a food allergy diagnosis based on a skin test alone. A doctor diagnoses a food allergy only when a patient has a positive skin test to a specific allergen and the history of these reactions suggests an allergy to the same food. In some extremely allergic patients who have severe anaphylactic reactions, skin testing cannot be used because it could evoke a dangerous reaction. For these patients a doctor may use blood tests such as the RAST and the ELISA. The final method used to objectively diagnose food allergy is a double-blind food challenge. In a true double-blind test, the doctor is also \"blinded\" (the capsules having been made up by some other medical person) so that neither the patient nor the doctor knows which capsule contains the allergen. The advantage of such a challenge is that if the patient has a reaction only to suspected foods and not to other foods tested, it confirms the diagnosis. In addition, this testing is expensive because it takes a lot of time to perform and multiple food allergies are difficult to evaluate with this procedure. This type of testing is most commonly used when the doctor believes that the reaction a person is describing is not due to a specific food and the doctor wishes to obtain evidence to support this judgment so that additional efforts may be directed at finding the real cause of the reaction. At least one situation may require more than the simple ingestion of a food allergen to provoke a reaction: exercise-induced food allergy. The cure for exercised-induced food allergy is simple -- not eating the suspected food for a couple of hours before exercising. Once a patient and the patient's doctor have identified the food to which the patient is sensitive, the food must be removed from the patient's diet. Many allergy-producing foods such as peanuts, eggs, and milk, appear in foods one normally would not associate them with. Peanuts, for example, are often used as a protein source and eggs are used in some salad dressings. People can avoid most of the things to which they are sensitive if they read food labels carefully and avoid restaurant-prepared foods that might have ingredients to which they are allergic. In highly allergic people even minuscule amounts of a food allergen (for example, 1/44,000 of a peanut kernel) can prompt an allergic reaction. Patients with severe food allergies must be prepared to treat an inadvertent exposure. To protect themselves, people who have had anaphylactic reactions to a food should wear medical alert bracelets or necklaces stating that they have a food allergy and that they are subject to severe reactions. Such people should always carry two syringes of adrenaline (epinephrine), obtained by prescription from their doctors, and be prepared to self-administer it if they think they are getting a food allergic reaction. Even if they are unclear that it is an allergic reaction, they should give the injection as a precaution because it will not hurt them and could save their life. Anaphylactic allergic reactions can be fatal even when they start off with mild symptoms such as a tingling in the mouth and throat or gastrointestinal discomfort. Parents and caregivers must know how to protect children from foods to which the children are allergic and how to manage the children if they consume a food to which they are allergic, including the administration of epinephrine. There are several medications that a patient can take to relieve food allergy symptoms that are not part of an anaphylactic reaction. No medication in any form can be taken before eating a certain food that will reliably prevent an allergic reaction to that food. Oral immunotherapy and injections containing small quantities of the food extracts to which the patient is allergic are being studied. Milk and soy allergies are particularly common food allergies in infants and young children. These allergies sometimes do not involve hives and asthma, but rather lead to colic, and perhaps blood in the stool or poor growth. Infants and children are thought to be particularly susceptible to this allergic syndrome because of the immaturity of their immune and digestive systems. The clinical picture is one of a very unhappy colicky child who may not sleep well at night. The doctor will sometimes prescribe corticosteroids to treat infants with severe food allergies. Exclusive breast feeding (excluding all other foods) of infants for the first four to six months of life, if possible, is recommended for its beneficial effects. There is no conclusive evidence that breast-feeding has a protective role in preventing food allergies later in life. They don't recommend soy formula as a strategy for preventing the development of allergies, either. There are several disorders thought by some to be caused by food allergies, but the evidence is currently insufficient or contrary to such claims. It is controversial, for example, whether migraine headaches can be caused by food allergies. The more difficult issue is whether food allergies actually cause migraines in such people. There is virtually no evidence that most rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis can be made worse by foods, despite claims to the contrary. There is also no evidence that food allergies can cause a disorder called the allergic tension fatigue syndrome, in which people are tired, nervous, and may have problems concentrating, or have headaches. Cerebral allergy is a term that has been applied to people who have trouble concentrating and have headaches as well as other complaints. There is no evidence that such a scenario can happen, and most doctors do not currently recognize cerebral allergy as a disorder. Some people believe hyperactivity in children is caused by food allergies. But researchers have found that this behavioral disorder in children is only occasionally associated with food additives, and then only when such additives are consumed in large amounts. There is no evidence that a true food allergy can affect a child's activity except for the theory that if a child itches and sneezes and wheezes a lot, the child may be miserable and therefore more difficult to guide. Also, children who are on allergy drugs that can cause drowsiness may get sleepy in school or at home. One controversial diagnostic technique is cytotoxicity testing, in which a food allergen is added to a patient's blood sample. Scientists have evaluated this technique in several studies and have not found it to effectively diagnose food allergies. In this procedure, dilute food allergen is administered under the tongue of the person who may feel that his or her arthritis, for instance, is due to foods. In clinical studies, researchers have not shown that this procedure can effectively diagnose food allergies. An immune complex assay is sometimes done on patients suspected of having food allergies to see if there are complexes of certain antibodies bound to the food allergen in the bloodstream. But the formation of such immune complexes is a normal offshoot of food digestion, and everyone, if tested with a sensitive enough measurement, has them. To date, no one has conclusively shown that this test correlates with allergies to foods. Controversial food allergy treatments include putting a dilute solution of a particular food under the tongue about a half hour before the patient eats that food. As the results of a carefully conducted clinical study show, this procedure is not effective in preventing an allergic reaction. There actually are several discrete diseases under this category, and a number of foods that can cause these problems. After one suspects a food allergy, a medical evaluation is the key to proper management."], [1867, "Food Addiction", "Experiments in animals and humans show that, for some people, the same reward and pleasure centers of the brain that are triggered by addictive drugs like cocaine and heroin are also activated by food, especially highly palatable foods. Once people experience pleasure associated with increased dopamine transmission in the brain's reward pathway from eating certain foods, they quickly feel the need to eat again. Compulsive overeating is a type of behavioral addiction meaning that someone can become preoccupied with a behavior (such as eating, or gambling, or shopping) that triggers intense pleasure. People with food addictions lose control over their eating behavior and find themselves spending excessive amounts of time involved with food and overeating, or anticipating the emotional effects of compulsive overeating. People who show signs of food addiction may also develop a kind of tolerance to food. People who are addicted to food will continue to eat despite negative consequences, such as weight gain or damaged relationships. And like people who are addicted to drugs or gambling, people who are addicted to food will have trouble stopping their behavior, even if they want to or have tried many times to cut back. Do you: End up eating more than planned when you start eating certain foods Keep eating certain foods even if you're no longer hungry Eat to the point of feeling ill Worry about not eating certain types of foods or worry about cutting down on certain types of foods When certain foods aren't available, go out of your way to obtain them The questionnaire also asks about the impact of your relationship with food on your personal life. Ask yourself if these situations apply to you: You eat certain foods so often or in such large amounts that you start eating food instead of working, spending time with the family, or doing recreational activities. You avoid professional or social situations where certain foods are available because of fear of overeating. For example, when you cut down on certain foods (excluding caffeinated beverages), do you have symptoms such as: Anxiety Agitation Other physical symptoms The questionnaire also tries to gauge the impact of food decisions on your emotions. Eating food causes problems such as depression, anxiety, self-loathing, or guilt. You need to eat more and more food to reduce negative emotions or increase pleasure. Eating the same amount of food doesn't reduce negative emotions or increase pleasure the way it used to. Some argue that recovery from food addiction may be more complicated than recovery from other kinds of addictions. A nutritionist, psychologist, or doctor who is educated about food addiction may be able to help you break the cycle of compulsive overeating. There are also a growing number of programs that help people who are addicted to food. Some, like Food Addicts in Recovery Anonymous, are based on the 12-step program that has helped many people addicted to alcohol, drugs, or gambling. Others, like Food Addicts Anonymous, use the principles of the 12-step program along with strict diets that advise people to abstain from problem ingredients, like sugar, refined flour, and wheat."], [1868, "Frozen Shoulder", "Frozen shoulder is a condition that affects your shoulder joint. It usually involves pain and stiffness that develops gradually, gets worse and then finally goes away. Your shoulder is made up of three bones that form a ball-and-socket joint. There's also tissue surrounding your shoulder joint that holds everything together. With frozen shoulder, the capsule becomes so thick and tight that it's hard to move. The main symptoms of a frozen shoulder are pain and stiffness that make it difficult or impossible to move it. If you have frozen shoulder, you'll likely feel a dull or achy pain in one shoulder. You might also feel the pain in the shoulder muscles that wrap around the top of your arm. Your pain could get worse at night, which can make it hard to sleep. Freezing stage: You develop a pain (sometimes severe) in your shoulder any time you move it. Frozen stage: Your pain might get better but your stiffness gets worse. Moving your shoulder becomes more difficult and it becomes harder to get through daily activities. Frozen shoulder happens more often in women than men, and you're more likely to get it if you're between the ages of 40 and 60. Your risk might also go up if you're in the process of recovering from a medical condition like a stroke, or surgery like a mastectomy that keeps you from moving your arm. You may also be more likely to get frozen shoulder if you have diabetes. Other medical problems like heart disease, thyroid disease, or Parkinson's disease are linked to frozen shoulder, too. To diagnose frozen shoulder, your doctor will give you a physical exam. During the \"active\" part of the exam, she'll let you move your shoulder on your own. This is a medication that will numb the pain so that she can better judge your active and passive ranges of motion. A physical exam is usually enough to diagnose frozen shoulder, but your doctor may also order imaging tests such as X-rays, ultrasound, or MRI to rule out other problems like arthritis or a torn rotator cuff that can also cause pain and limit how far it moves. Over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and inflammation in your shoulder. Your treatment might also include going to a physical therapist for strengthening and stretching exercises to improve your range of motion. If your symptoms are intense or don't improve over time, your doctor might recommend other kinds of treatments, including: A corticosteroid injection in your shoulder joint to reduce your pain and improve your range of motion. This means your doctor will inject sterile water into your shoulder capsule to stretch it. Results with this are mixed, and it may be more useful during certain phases of frozen shoulder than others. This is very rarely necessary to treat frozen shoulder. But if other treatments haven't helped, your doctor may suggest surgery. That means it's done with lighted, pencil-sized tools that are inserted through tiny cuts in your shoulder. Shoulder manipulation can help loosen up your shoulder tissue, but is very rarely done anymore because arthroscopic surgery has replaced it."], [1869, "Follicular Lymphoma", "There are two types of lymphomas: Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's, based on the kind of white blood cell they affect. When you have follicular lymphoma, the sick blood cells can travel to many parts of your body, such as your organs, bone marrow, and lymph nodes (pea-sized glands in your neck, groin, and under your arms that are part of your immune system). Although follicular lymphoma usually can't be cured, you can live long and well with it. You may not need treatment for many years, or ever. Doctors don't know what causes follicular and other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. In some cases, radiation or cancer-causing chemicals, or certain infections, may be a cause. You're also more likely to get the disease if you have HIV, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or celiac disease, which are all immune system disorders. You may have no symptoms of follicular lymphoma. If you do have symptoms, you may have: Painless swelling of the lymph nodes in your neck, groin, stomach, or armpits Shortness of breath Fatigue Night sweats Weight loss First, your doctor will do a physical exam and ask you questions like: Have you had a lump in your neck, groin, stomach, or armpits? Have you been diagnosed with HIV, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or celiac disease? If your doctor notices that you have enlarged lymph nodes, it doesn't mean you have cancer. If you do have one, your doctor may give you an antibiotic to see if it shrinks in a few weeks. If you have other lymphoma symptoms or the lymph node is very large, or if it doesn't shrink with antibiotics, your doctor will do a biopsy. To do that, he'll remove either the whole lymph node or part of it. If a node is hard to reach, he may use a very thin needle to remove a little bit of lymph node tissue through your skin. This is usually an \"outpatient\" procedure, which means you don't need to stay overnight in a hospital. Sometimes your doctor may numb the area first, but that's not always needed. Using a microscope, experts will check the tissue from the biopsy. If it shows that you have follicular lymphoma, your doctor will want to do other tests. These may include blood tests and: Bone marrow test. Your doctor will take samples of your bone marrow, usually from the back of your hip bone. For this test, you lie down on a table and get a shot that will numb the area. Then your doctor uses a needle to remove a small amount of liquid bone marrow. Your doctor will look at the sample under a microscope and check for sick cells to see if the disease has spread. CT scan, or computed tomography. The results will help your doctor check which parts of your body are affected and the stage of the lymphoma. Based on that information, you and your doctor can decide if you need treatment and what kind. You may want to get a second opinion before you take action. You may want to ask your doctor if you can take part in a clinical trial. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for you. If you have no symptoms, your doctor may decide just to watch you closely. Your doctor may advise starting treatment if: Your lymph nodes keep getting larger You have a fever or night sweats You are losing weight You have low blood counts After treatment, many people stay disease-free for years, although the cancer usually returns. Over time, 30% to 40% of follicular lymphomas behave like or turn into other forms of lymphoma that grow faster and need intensive treatment. If you do need treatment, it may include one or more of the following: Radiation. It kills cancer cells.The radiation comes from a high-energy beam, similar to an X-ray, or from material put inside your body in or near the cancer. If yours is at an early stage, you may only need radiation. If it's advanced, you may get other treatments as well. You may also take rituximab as maintenance therapy, to slow the growth of lymphoma. You get it by IV in your doctor's office or at an infusion center. Usually, you get this treatment by IV or as a pill. Because it enters the bloodstream and reaches most parts of the body, it works very well for lymphoma. Your doctor may recommend it if your lymphoma comes back or doesn't respond to chemotherapy. These aren't the \"embryonic\" stem cells that you may have heard about. They come from either your own stem cells or a donor's bone marrow. Close relatives, such as your brother or sister, are the best chance for a good match. If that doesn't work out, you need to get on a list of potential donors from strangers. Sometimes the best chance for the right stem cells for you will be from someone who is in the same racial or ethnic background as you. Before the transplant you will likely need to get treated with high doses of chemo for about a week or two. This can be a tough process because you may get side effects like nausea and mouth sores. You won't feel any pain from this, and you're awake while it's happening. After your transplant, it could take 2 to 6 weeks for the stem cells to multiply and start making new blood cells. During this time you may be in the hospital, or at the very least, will need to make visits every day to get checked by your transplant team. It can take 6 months to a year until the number of normal blood cells in your body gets back to what it should be. It's normal to have mixed feelings: happy that you're not having symptoms or are disease-free after treatment, but worried about what might happen in the future. These tips may help: Don't try to ignore whatever fears you have. Exercise, eat a balanced diet, and make any other changes that would help take better care of yourself. This helps you feel better and have more sense of control. It grows slowly, and new and better treatments are helping people live disease-free for longer periods of time. Most people respond well to treatment -- not just the first time, but if it comes back. Stay informed and talk to your doctor about all your treatment options and the clinical trials that might be helpful for you. The Lymphoma Research Foundation offers many resources on treatments, research advances, clinical trials, and ways to cope with follicular lymphoma."], [1870, "Folliculitis", "There are a number of skin conditions that cause lumps and bumps to appear on the surface or just below the skin. This article covers some of the most common ones, and includes the following: Skin cysts Cherry angioma Dermatofibromas Epidermoid cysts Folliculitis Keratoacanthoma Keratosis pilaris Lipomas Neurofibromas Cysts are noncancerous, closed pockets of tissue that can be filled with fluid, pus, or other material. Cysts can develop as a result of infection, clogging of sebaceous glands (oil glands), or around foreign bodies, such as earrings. Skin cysts usually are: Slow-growing Painless Smooth to the touch when they are rolled under the skin Cysts usually do not cause pain unless they rupture or become infected or inflamed. Cysts that do not respond to other treatments or reoccur can be removed surgically if they cause troublesome symptoms. Cherry angiomas are small, bright red growths that are smooth. If they are cosmetically unappealing or are subject to bleeding, angiomas may be removed by lasers or electrocautery -- the process of burning or destroying tissue by use of a small probe with an electric current running through it. Dermatofibromas are harmless round, red-brownish skin growths that are most commonly found on the arms and legs. Dermatofibromas contains scar tissue and feel like hard lumps in the skin. The symptoms of dermatofibromas include: A red, brown, or purple growth that can change colors over time A growth that is as small as a BB pellet Tenderness, pain, and itching; however, growths also can be painless A dimple that appears when the growth is pinched In most cases, there is no need to treat dermatofibromas. However, the growths can be removed surgically or can be flattened by being frozen with liquid nitrogen. Epidermoid cysts, also called sebaceous cysts, are benign (non-cancerous) skin cysts formed by an outpouching from the hair follicle. Most commonly, epidermoid cysts are found on the genitals, chest, and back; but, they also can occur in other areas of the skin. When the cysts are squeezed, they can produce a cheesy white discharge. The effective treatment of epidermoid cysts requires that the sac of the cyst be completely removed. Usually, a doctor will be able to remove the cyst by making only a small incision in the skin. It can be caused by an infection in the hair follicles, by chemical irritation or by physical irritation (for example, shaving or friction from clothing). Typical body sites that are involved in folliculitis include the face, thighs, and scalp. The main lesion in folliculitis is a papule or pustule with a central hair. Other signs and symptoms include: Multiple red pimples and/or pustules on hair-bearing areas of the body Itching skin Topical antibiotics, oral antibiotics, or antifungal drugs may be used to treat infections associated with folliculitis, depending on the underlying cause. Steps that can help achieve this goal include: Minimizing friction from clothing Not shaving in the affected area, if possible. The growth may be triggered by a minor skin injury in an area that previously had suffered sun damage. Keratoacanthomas appear most often in people who are over the age of 60 and they are considered a low-grade skin cancer. Keratoacanthomas are rapidly growing, red, dome-shaped bumps with central craters. Keratoacanthomas can be removed by: Cryotherapy (freezing the growth with liquid nitrogen) Curettage (scraping and burning off the growth) Surgical removal Injection of a cancer drug directly into the lesion Keratosis pilaris (commonly called KP) appears as \"chicken skin bumps\" on the skin. The bumps are usually white or red, but do not itch or hurt. Keratosis pilaris is usually worse during the winter months or other times of low humidity when skin becomes dry. Treatment of keratosis pilaris is not medically necessary; but, individuals with this condition may want to seek treatment for cosmetic reasons. A cream such as AmLactin or LadHydrin can be applied after bathing, and then re-applied several times a day. Other treatments may include: Medicated creams containing urea (Carmol-20) or alpha-hydroxy acids (Aqua Glycolic, Lacticare) applied twice daily Efforts to unplug pores by taking long, hot soaking tub baths and then rubbing and exfoliating the areas with a coarse washcloth or stiff brush Lipomas are subcutaneous soft tissue tumors that usually are slow-growing and are harmless. Lipomas tend to form on the trunk, shoulders, neck, but can appear elsewhere on the body. Most lipomas are less than 5 cm in diameter and have no symptoms, but they can cause pain when they compress nerves. Lipomas are not removed unless there is a cosmetic concern, a compression of surrounding structures, or an uncertain diagnosis. An alternative to standard excision is to manually squeeze the lipoma through a small incision. This technique is useful in areas with thin dermis, such as the face and extremities. Neurofibromas are soft, fleshy growths that occur on or under the skin, sometimes even deep within the body. These are harmless tumors; however, they can turn malignant or cancerous in rare cases. The symptoms of neurofibromas may vary, depending on the locations and the sizes of the tumors. Symptoms can include: A painless, slow-growing mass Occasional pain Electric-like \"shock\" when the affected area is touched Neurological problems if the tumor involves a major motor or sensory nerve or a nerve that is compressed between the tumor and a hard structure If the tumor is not causing any symptoms, no treatment is necessary. However, doctors may choose to surgically remove the neurofibroma if it is affecting a major nerve. In most cases, neurofibromas are treated successfully and do not recur."], [1871, "Focal Dermal Dysplasia Syndrome", "Focal dermal hypoplasia (FDH), also known as Goltz syndrome, is a rare skin disorder that can also affect bone and eye development.

In addition, an abnormal skin-covered gap in the front of the head (anterior cranium occultum) may also be present in some cases. The exact cause of frontonasal dysplasia is not known."], [1873, "Flossing a Child's Teeth", "By starting early, your baby gets used to the daily routine. A soft washcloth wrapped around your finger can substitute for a brush when teeth first appear. Here are some tips for taking care of your child's teeth: Choose a small, child-sized, soft-bristled toothbrush. Both the American Dental Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend using an amount of fluoride toothpaste the size of a grain of rice as soon as your baby's first tooth appears. You can graduate to a pea-sized amount when your child turns 3 years old. Brush your child's teeth twice a day - in the morning and just before bed. Spend 2 minutes brushing, concentrating a good portion of this time on the back molars. Start flossing your child's teeth once a day as soon as two teeth emerge that touch. The use of floss sticks or picks instead of regular string floss may be easier for both you and your child. After your child is 6 years old, a fluoride rinse can help prevent cavities. Ask your dentist about dental sealants. These are thin, plastic protective barriers that fill in the chewing surfaces of the back teeth, protecting them from tooth decay. Allowing your child to watch you brush your teeth teaches the importance of good oral hygiene. Fluoride is a natural mineral that protects and strengthens the teeth against the formation of cavities. Using it early in your child's life will provide extra protection for developing teeth. If your tap water does not contain fluoride, ask your dentist if you should give your child a fluoride supplement. Check with the manufacturer of the filter you have purchased or have the water tested by a laboratory that does this type of testing. Also, look for toothpastes that carry the American Dental Association's (ADA) Seal of Acceptance. This indicates that the toothpaste has met ADA criteria for safety and effectiveness. Some toothpastes are not recommended for children under a certain age. Generally, mouthwashes are not recommended in children who are incapable of spitting and rinsing - skills that occur around the age of 6. In older children, a fluoride mouth rinse can help prevent tooth decay and cavities in addition to brushing and flossing. Rinsing after a meal with water will also help remove some larger particles of food left on or between the teeth. It is generally recommended that an infant be seen by a dentist by age 1 or within 6 months after his or her first tooth comes in."], [1874, "Flatfoot (Pes Planus)", "Flatfoot (pes planus) is a condition in which the longitudinal arch in the foot, which runs lengthwise along the sole of the foot, has not developed normally and is lowered or flattened out. Flatfoot may be an inherited condition or may be caused by an injury or condition such as rheumatoid arthritis, stroke, or diabetes. Most children are flat-footed until they are between the ages of 3 and 5 when their longitudinal arch develops normally. Treatment in adults generally consists of wearing spacious, comfortable shoes with good arch support. Your doctor may recommend padding for the heel (heel cup) or orthotic shoe devices, which are molded pieces of rubber, leather, metal, plastic, or other synthetic material that are inserted into a shoe. They balance the foot in a neutral position and cushion the foot from excessive pounding. For children, treatment using corrective shoes or inserts is rarely needed, as the arch usually develops normally by age 5. Stand about 1 ft (30 cm) from a wall and place the palms of both hands against the wall at chest level. Step back with one foot, keeping that leg straight at the knee, and both feet flat on the floor. Your feet should point directly at the wall or slightly in toward the center of your body. Bend your other (front) leg at the knee, and press the wall with both hands until you feel a gentle stretch on your back leg (calf muscle). Hold for a count of 10 (increasing the count to 30 or longer as you continue over several weeks). Place a towel on the floor, and sit down in a chair in front of it with both feet resting flat on the towel at one end. Grip the towel with the toes of one foot (keep your heel on the floor and use your other foot to anchor the towel). To increase strength, later use 3 lb (1.5 kg) to 5 lb (2.5 kg) weights (such as a large can of fruit or vegetables) on the other end of the towel. Sit down on the floor or a mat with your feet stretched out in front of you. Roll up a towel lengthwise and then loop it over one foot (around the ball of your foot).

Cramps in your stomach and gut, diarrhea, and vomiting may start as early as 1 hour after eating tainted food and as late as 10 days or longer.

One reason could be that you don't have enough hemoglobin to make red blood cells. You can also become anemic by not getting enough folate (vitamin B9), the natural form of folic acid found in foods. You can get folic acid deficiency anemia a few different ways. You might not be eating enough foods like leafy green vegetables, beans, citrus fruits, or whole grains. Over time, this makes it harder for your intestines to absorb folate. When your small intestine isn't working the way it should, your body has a hard time hanging on to as much folate as it needs. For instance, people with celiac disease are at risk for this type of anemia. A medication you're taking is keeping your body from absorbing folate. Problems absorbing enough folic acid can run in families. Any kind of anemia can cause problems like: Fatigue Lack of energy Feeling short of breath Headaches Pale skin Racing heart Weight loss or not feeling hungry Ringing in your ears If your anemia is caused by not having enough folate in your body, you could also notice the following: Reduced sense of taste Diarrhea Pins and needles feeling or numbness in your hands and feet Muscle weakness Depression To check for folate deficiency anemia, your doctor will ask you about your symptoms. He might also order blood tests and a complete blood count (CBC) test to measure the number and appearance of your red blood cells. If you have a lack of folate, your red blood cells look large and immature. Folate deficiency anemia is prevented and treated by eating a healthy diet. Your doctor will also likely prescribe you a daily folic acid supplement. If your folate levels return to normal, you may be able to stop taking it. But if you've been without folate for a long time, your risk of having some types of cancer and heart disease goes up. Your fertility will likely return to normal once you're getting enough folate again. If you are pregnant and don't get enough folate, you are at higher risk of a placental abruption. Your unborn child can also be harmed by too little folate. She's also more likely to have spina bifida, a disease that causes damage to the spinal cord and nerves. If left untreated, some of these could get worse and your anemia could cause lasting damage."], [1880, "Food Poisoning Medications", "Medicines aren't used routinely in food poisoning.

Sports drinks, soda pop, and fruit juices contain too much sugar and not enough of the important electrolytes that are lost during diarrhea, so they shouldn't be used to rehydrate. Eating your usual diet will help you to get enough nutrition. For children who are breastfeeding or bottle-feeding, continue the regular breast milk or formula feeding as much as possible. Give an oral rehydration solution (ORS), such as Pedialyte, between feedings only if you see signs of dehydration.

While cold symptoms can make you feel bad for a few days, flu symptoms can make you feel quite ill for a few days to weeks. Cold symptoms usually begin with a sore throat, which usually goes away after a day or two. Nasal symptoms, runny nose, and congestion follow, along with a cough by the fourth and fifth days. Fever is uncommon in adults, but a slight fever is possible. With cold symptoms, the nose teems with watery nasal secretions for the first few days. If cold symptoms do not seem to be improving after a week, you may have a bacterial infection, which means you may need antibiotics. Sometimes you may mistake cold symptoms for allergic rhinitis (hay fever) or a sinus infection. If cold symptoms begin quickly and are improving after a week, then it is usually a cold, not allergy. If your cold symptoms do not seem to be getting better after a week, check with your doctor to see if you have developed an allergy or sinusitis. Flu symptoms are usually more severe than cold symptoms and come on quickly. Symptoms of flu include sore throat, fever, headache, muscle aches and soreness, congestion, and cough. Most flu symptoms gradually improve over two to five days, but it's not uncommon to feel run down for a week or more. A common complication of the flu is pneumonia, particularly in the young, elderly, or people with lung or heart problems. Another common sign of pneumonia is fever that comes back after having been gone for a day or two. Just like cold viruses, flu viruses enter your body through the mucous membranes of the nose, eyes, or mouth. Every time you touch your hand to one of these areas, you could be infecting yourself with a virus, which makes it very important to keep hands germ-free with frequent washing to prevent both flu and cold symptoms. Flu symptoms often mimic cold symptoms with nasal congestion, cough, aches, and malaise. With flu symptoms, you will probably have a fever initially with the flu virus and you will feel miserable. If you already have flu or cold symptoms, it's important to call your doctor if you also have any of the following severe symptoms: Persistent fever: A fever lasting more than three days can be a sign of another bacterial infection that should be treated. Painful swallowing: Although a sore throat from a cold or flu can cause mild discomfort, severe pain could mean strep throat, which requires treatment by a doctor. Persistent congestion and headaches: When colds and allergies cause congestion and blockage of sinus passages, they can lead to a sinus infection (sinusitis). If you have pain around the eyes and face with thick nasal discharge after a week, you may have a bacterial infection and possibly need an antibiotic. In adults, signs of a crisis include: Severe chest pain Severe headache Shortness of breath Dizziness Confusion Persistent vomiting In children, additional signs of an emergency are: Difficulty breathing or rapid breathing Bluish skin color Not drinking enough fluids Lethargy and failure to interact normally Extreme irritability or distress Symptoms that were improving and then suddenly worsen Fever with a rash The most important prevention measure for preventing colds and flu is frequent hand washing. Hand washing by rubbing the hands with warm soapy water for at least 20 seconds helps to slough germs off the skin. In addition to hand washing to prevent flu or cold symptoms, you can also get a flu vaccine to prevent seasonal influenza. Within two weeks of getting a flu vaccine, antibodies develop in the body and provide protection against flu."], [1884, "Food Poisoning Treatment Overview", "In most cases, the diarrhea and other symptoms of food poisoning go away in 2 to 3 days, and you don't need treatment. It may be longer than 2 to 3 days until you feel normal again. All you have to do is manage symptoms, especially diarrhea, and avoid complications until the illness passes. In most cases, dehydration caused by diarrhea is the main complication. Extra precautions should be taken to prevent dehydration in children. To learn more about treating dehydration, including in children, see Home Treatment. The goal of treatment is to replace fluids and electrolytes lost through vomiting and diarrhea. If dehydration is severe and can't be managed at home, you may need treatment in the hospital, where fluids and electrolytes may be given to you by inserting a needle into your vein (intravenously). Medicines that stop diarrhea (such as Imodium) can help with your symptoms.

Sometimes the following tests are done: A stool culture may be done if your doctor suspects that you have eaten contaminated food, your symptoms are severe, or the diagnosis is uncertain. Blood tests may be done to help find out whether the food poisoning is caused by bacteria or to rule out other causes.

If you think you have eaten contaminated food, your local Poison Control Center can answer questions and provide information on what to do next. Children, pregnant women, and people with long-lasting (chronic) conditions, such as diabetes, are more likely to have severe dehydration and should be watched closely for symptoms. Watchful waiting is a period of time during which you and your doctor observe your symptoms or condition without using medical treatment. Watchful waiting may be appropriate if you have diarrhea, stomach cramps, and other symptoms of stomach flu (gastroenteritis). Likewise, some cases of bacterial food poisoning are mild and pass in several days. But if diarrhea is severe or lasts longer than a week, call your doctor for advice.

Your symptoms depend greatly on the type of organism that has infected you. Unless the illness is part of a recognized outbreak, it's difficult to identify the infecting organism. You may feel weak for several days after other symptoms go away. Most of the time, food poisoning is mild and passes in a few days.

If you are a teenage girl, see your doctor if you have not started having periods by age 15. Along with starting your period, your body is changing. You can even get pregnant in the month before your first period starts. In the days before you start your period, you may feel tense or emotional. You may have pain (cramps) in your abdomen, back, or legs that lasts a few hours or more. When you start your period, you'll notice a spot of blood on your underwear or when you use the bathroom. The flow of blood from your vagina is usually light at first and may get heavier for a few days before tapering off. Your period will usually last 3 to 7 days each month. Ask your mom, a doctor, or a woman you trust for advice on using feminine products for the bleeding, such as tampons or pads. For more information on managing menstrual cramps, see: Your period is part of your menstrual cycle, the time from the first day of your period to the first day of the next period. A normal menstrual cycle for teenagers can be anywhere from 21 days to 45 days. For the first year or two, your cycle may not be regular and you may not have a period sometimes. If you are underweight because of dieting or exercise, have a lot of stress in your life, or are overweight, your periods may be hard to predict. Keep a calendar, and mark the day you start your period each month. This can help you predict when you'll have your next period and is also useful when you talk with your doctor. Your menstrual cycle makes it possible for you to get pregnant. Sometime around the middle of each cycle, you will ovulate , which means one of your ovaries will release an egg. You are most likely to get pregnant if you have sexual intercourse on the day of ovulation or on any of the five days before it. For more information, see: You should assume you can get pregnant any time of the month. The timing of ovulation is different for everyone, especially those who have periods that don't start at the same time every month.

Though it can resemble other childhood rashes, such as rubella or scarlet fever, fifth disease usually begins with the distinctive, sudden appearance of bright red cheeks that look as though the child has been slapped. Fifth disease got its name many years ago when it was the fifth on a list of the six recognized childhood rash-forming illnesses; the others include rubella, measles, scarlet fever, chickenpox, and roseola infantum. It poses little risk to healthy children and adults, with a couple of exceptions: pregnant women and people with certain types of chronic anemia. If a pregnant woman is infected in the first half of her pregnancy, there is a small risk of severe anemia in the fetus and a 10% risk of miscarriage. Fifth disease is caused by parvovirus B19 and is spread by respiratory secretions from an infected person. The incubation period (the period between infection and signs or symptoms of illness) is usually four to 14 days, but can be as long as 21 days."], [1893, "Fiery Serpent Infection", "Dracunculosis is an infection caused by a parasitic worm known as Dracunculus medinensis, the guinea worm.

Although it mostly happens in middle-aged men, younger and older men can get it. When the penis is soft, you can't see a problem. But in severe cases, the hardened plaque hampers flexibility, causing pain and forcing the penis to bend or arc when erect. In most cases, the pain eases over time, but the bend in the penis can worsen. Some men with the condition develop scar tissue elsewhere in the body, such as on the hand or foot. Men with Dupuytren's contractures -- scarring in the hand that affects fingers -- seem to be more likely to get Peyronie's. Tell your doctor about anything, such as an injury, that happened before the symptoms started. You'll get an exam in which your doctor will feel the hardened tissue caused by the disease during an exam. It's not always necessary, but if the penis has to be erect for the exam, the doctor would inject a medicine to make that happen. There's a chance you may need to get an X-ray or ultrasound of the penis. It's rare, but in some cases where the doctor's exam does not confirm Peyronie's disease, or if the condition develops rapidly, your doctor may do a biopsy. Since the condition improves without treatment in some men, doctors often suggest waiting 1 to 2 years or longer before they try to correct it. Mild cases of the condition rarely need treatment. If it's not causing a problem with your sex life, treatment may not be necessary. If you need treatment, your doctor will consider surgery or medicine. First, your doctor will probably prescribe a pill, such as pentoxifylline or potassium para-aminobenzoate (Potaba). If those don't work, you may get a shot of verapamil or collagenase (Xiaflex) into the scar tissue of the penis. The two most common operations are: Remove the plaque and get a tissue graft in its place. Remove or alter the tissue on the side of the penis opposite the plaque, which counters the disease's bending effect. The second method, which doctors call the Nesbit procedure, shortens the erect penis. In some cases, it may be an option to get a penile prosthesis implanted. But because of the possibility of complications that can't be corrected, most doctors prefer to operate only on the small number of men with curvature so severe that it prevents sex. There have been mixed results on studies of vitamin E and with potassium aminobenzoate, which is related to the B vitamins. But because radiation therapy can only relieve pain associated with Peyronie's disease and pain often stops without treatment, it's rarely done. In most men who have penile pain due to Peyronie's disease, the discomfort usually will fade on its own as the penile inflammation subsides."], [1895, "Fibrous Ankylosis of Multiple Joints", "Arthrogryposis is a general or descriptive term for the development of nonprogressive contractures affecting one or more areas of the body prior to birth (congenitally). A contracture is a condition in which a joint becomes permanently fixed in a bent (flexed) or straightened (extended) position, completely or partially restricting the movement of the affected joint. When congenital contractures occur only in one body area, it is not referred to as arthrogryposis but rather an isolated congenital contracture. When arthrogryposis affects two or more different areas of the body, it may be referred to as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC). The joints of the legs and arms are usually affected, the legs are affected more often than the arms. The joints of the shoulders, elbows, knees, wrists, ankles, fingers, toes, and/or hips are also commonly affected. In addition, the jaws and back may also be affected in individuals with AMC.

Specifically, this disorder causes the body's skeletal muscles and soft connective tissues to undergo a metamorphosis, essentially a transformation into bone, progressively locking joints in place and making movement difficult or impossible. Other skeletal malformations of the cervical spine and ribs and the abnormal development of bone at multiple soft tissue sites may lead episodically to stiffness in affected areas, limited movement, and eventual ankylosis of affected joints (neck, shoulders, elbows, hips knees, wrists, ankles, jaw, often in that order).

If you notice any breast changes, you should call your doctor right away to get checked, but don't panic. Most breast lumps are benign, which means they're not cancerous. There are several common causes, including normal changes in breast tissue, breast infection or injury, and medicines that may cause lumps or breast pain. Breast tissue changes during a woman's entire life. It is sensitive to changing hormone levels during the menstrual cycle. For some women, changes in hormones during normal monthly menstrual cycles can create breast changes. These are known as fibrocystic breast changes. Women with fibrocystic breasts usually get lumps in both breasts that increase in size and tenderness just before they get their period. The lumps may be hard or rubbery and may be felt as a single (large or small) breast lump. Fibrocystic changes can also cause breast tissue to thicken. They are the most common cause of benign breast lumps in women ages 35 to 50. Simple cysts are fluid-filled sacs that usually happen in both breasts. Tenderness and size often change with your menstrual cycle. If you push on them they are solid, round, rubbery lumps that move freely. These are small, wart-like growths in the lining of the mammary duct near the nipple. This happens when there is an injury to the breast, thought you may not remember an injury happening. It causes fat to form in lumps that are generally round, firm, hard, and painless. Fibrocystic breast changes do not require treatment, but your doctor may recommend things to help relieve monthly tenderness. A small needle is used to suck out some cells from the breast lump. If the lump is a cyst, they can suck out the fluid and the cyst will collapse. Cysts can also go away on their own, so your doctor may choose to wait before trying to get rid of it. It can be hard to tell if a lump from traumatic fat necrosis is that or something else until your doctor does a biopsy. Men can have tender breast enlargement, often with a lump under the nipple. Sometimes this is in one breast, but it often happens in both. Sometimes a painful lump, with or without redness, is the first sign of an infection. It's caused by bacteria that get into the mammary ducts through the nipple. You'll feel tender, warm lumps in the breast. For relief, try a hot shower and let the warm water flow over your breasts. See your doctor if you discover any new breast changes. A doctor should examine you if you find: An area that is clearly different from any other area on either breast A lump or thickening in or near the breast or underarm that persists through the menstrual cycle A change in the size, shape, or contour of the breast A mass or lump, which may feel as small as a pea A marble-like area under the skin A change in the feel of the skin on the breast or nipple or how it looks. Clear or bloody fluid coming out of the nipple Red skin on the breast or nipple Your doctor will ask you some questions about your health history. He will perform a breast exam to feel for lumps or other changes in the breast tissue and under the arms. If there is fluid coming out of your nipple, your doctor will collect a sample and check for cancer cells. He may also do a mammogram or ultrasound to see if the lump is solid or filled with fluid. Your doctor may order a biopsy. He will take a tiny sample of the lump with a needle or small cut and send it to a lab. Once you turn 20, your doctor may give you a breast exam in which he feels your breast tissue for changes. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends a clinical breast exam every 1-3 years starting at 20. Get a mammogram as you get older. If you're at high risk for breast cancer, you should get a mammogram every year. You may start getting them at a younger age, too. Breast MRI screening, in addition to mammogram, is used only if your lifetime risk of breast cancer is greater than 20%."], [1899, "Fibroblastoma, Perineural", "An acoustic neuroma, also known as a vestibular schwannoma, is a rare benign (non-cancerous) growth that develops on the eighth cranial nerve.

Chordomas are slow growing tumors that cause destruction of the surrounding bone and eventually extend into the surrounding soft tissue. Sometimes chordoma spreads through the bloodstream (metastasizes) to other organs, such as the lungs, lymph nodes, liver or other bones. Although chordoma can develop at any point during life, it most commonly occurs in older adults. In extremely rare cases, chordomas may develop in multiple members of the same family as a result of certain genetic risk factors (familial chordoma).

While there are many things that you can do to reduce your risk for falls, the two most important things are to work with your doctor to ensure that your treatments are optimal and to consult with a physical therapist who can assess your walking and balance. The physical therapist is the expert when it comes to recommending assistive devices or exercises to improve safety. If you or a loved one has Parkinson's disease, here are tips for preventing falls around the home: Floors. Make sure halls, stairways, and entrances are well lit. Make sure there is a light switch at the top and bottom of the staircase. Make sure lamps or light switches are within reach of the bed if you have to get up during the night. Make sure treads, rails, and rugs are secure. If stairs are a threat, it may be helpful to arrange most of your activities on the lower level to reduce the number of times stairs must be climbed. Keep at least one hand free at all times; try using a backpack or fanny pack to hold things rather than carrying them in your hands. Never carry objects in both hands when walking as this interferes with balance. This may require a conscious effort if Parkinson's disease has diminished your movement; however, it will help you to maintain balance, posture, and reduce fatigue. Consciously lift your feet off of the ground when walking. Shuffling and dragging your feet may cause you to lose your balance. When trying to navigate turns, use a \"U\" technique of facing forward and making a wide turn, rather than pivoting sharply. When your feet are close together for any length of time, you increase your risk of losing your balance and falling. Don't try to walk and accomplish another task, such as reading or looking around. Do not wear rubber or gripping soled shoes, they may \"catch\" on the floor and cause tripping. Use deliberate, concentrated movements and if needed, use a grab bar or walking aid. For example, when rising from a seated position, wait 15 seconds after standing to begin walking. If you become \"frozen,\" visualize stepping over an imaginary object, or have someone place their foot in front of yours to step over. Try not to have a caregiver or companion \"pull\" you, this may throw you off balance and even prolong the episode. If balance is a continuous problem, you may want to consider a walking aid such as a cane, walking stick, or walker. Once you've mastered walking with help, you may be ready to try it on your own again!"], [1905, "Fainting", "Fainting, also called syncope (pronounced SIN-ko-pee), is a sudden, brief loss of consciousness and posture caused by decreased blood flow to the brain. These include heart problems such as irregular heart beats, seizures, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), anemia (a deficiency in healthy oxygen carrying cells), and problems with how the nervous system (the body's system of nerves) regulates blood pressure. While fainting may indicate a particular medical condition, sometimes it may occur in an otherwise healthy individual. A person may feel faint and lightheaded (presyncope) or lose consciousness (syncope). A simple episode, also called a vasovagal attack or neurally-mediated syncope, is the most common type of fainting spell. You may suffer from a simple fainting spell due to anxiety, fear, pain, intense emotional stress, hunger, or use of alcohol or drugs. Most people who suffer from simple fainting have no underlying heart or neurological (nerve or brain) problem. Some people have a problem with the way their body regulates their blood pressure, particularly when they move too quickly from a lying or sitting position to a standing position. This type of fainting is more common in the elderly, people who recently had a lengthy illness that kept them in bed and people who have poor muscle tone. Your autonomic nervous system is the part of the nervous system that controls involuntary vital functions, such as the beating of your heart, the degree to which your blood vessels are constricted, and breathing. If you have one of these disorders, you are likely to have other symptoms, such as erectile dysfunction (inability to have or maintain an erection), loss of bladder and bowel control, loss of the normal reflexes of your pupils, or decreased sweating, tearing, and salivation. Conditions that interfere with the parts of the nervous system that regulate blood pressure and heart rate. These conditions include diabetes, alcoholism, malnutrition, and amyloidosis (in which waxy protein builds up in the tissues and organs). If you take certain high blood pressure drugs, which act on your blood vessels, you may be more likely to suffer from fainting. If you are dehydrated, which may affect the amount of blood in your body and, thus, your blood pressure, you may be more likely to faint. These may include heart block (a problem with the electrical impulses that control your heart muscle), problems with the sinus node (a specialized area of your heart that helps it beat), heart arrhythmia (irregular heart rhythm), a blood clot in the lungs, an abnormally narrowed aortic heart valve, or certain other problems with the structure of your heart. These include micturition syncope (fainting during or after urination), glossopharyngeal neuralgia (fainting due to inflammation and pain in a particular nerve to the mouth); cough syncope (fainting after intense coughing), and stretch syncope (fainting that occurs when stretching the neck and arms). If you become intensely anxious or panicked and breathe too quickly, you may feel faint from hyperventilation (taking in too much oxygen and getting rid of too much carbon dioxide too quickly)."], [1906, "Factitious Disorder by Proxy", "Use a safe computer such as one at work, a friend's house, or a library. Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSBP) is a mental health problem in which a caregiver makes up or causes an illness or injury in a person under his or her care, such as a child, an elderly adult, or a person who has a disability. Because vulnerable people are the victims, MSBP is a form of child abuse or elder abuse. Note: Since most cases of MSBP are between a caregiver (usually a mother) and a child, the rest of this topic will describe that relationship. But it is important to remember that MSBP can involve any vulnerable person who has a caregiver. The caregiver with MSBP may: Lie about the child's symptoms. Change test results to make a child appear to be ill. Physically harm the child to produce symptoms. They may even become seriously ill or injured or may die because of the actions of the caregiver. Children who are victims of MSBP can have lifelong physical and emotional problems and may have Munchausen syndrome as adults. Doctors aren't sure what causes it, but it may be linked to problems during the abuser's childhood. The attention that caregivers get from having a sick child may encourage their behavior. For example, neighbors may try to help the family in many ways-such as by doing chores, bringing meals, or giving money. A person with MSBP often: Has medical skills or experience. Checking a child's medical records for past tests, treatments, and hospital stays may help a doctor or nurse find out if a health problem is real. Doctors or nurses may suspect a problem when: A child has a repeated or unusual illness, and no reason can be found. Symptoms only occur when the caregiver is with or has recently been with the child. But symptoms get better or go away when the caregiver is not there or is being closely watched. The other parent (usually the father) is not involved in the child's treatment, even though the child's condition may be serious. And he or she may be strangely calm or happy when the child's condition is getting worse. The caregiver is seen (or videotaped or recorded) harming the child or causing symptoms. Another child in the family has had unexplained illness or death. Child protective services, law enforcement, and doctors are all involved in treatment for Munchausen syndrome by proxy. They may resist treatment or deny that there is a problem. Medicines are used only when the caregiver has another health problem, such as anxiety disorder, along with MSBP. So doctors, counselors, and family members need to closely watch how the caregiver interacts with his or her children. For victims, the first step is to protect the child by moving him or her into safe custody. Most of the time, the child's symptoms stop after the child is away from the caregiver. If you suspect that a child is a victim, don't confront the suspected caregiver. You can make a report without using your name (anonymous)."], [1907, "Facio-Scapulo-Humeral Dystrophy", "Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), also known as Landouzy-Dejerine muscular dystrophy, is a neuromuscular disorder.

There are treatments that can make a difference in how you feel, day-to-day. Getting support from your family and friends is key, too. You get Fabry disease from your parents. The problem is that your body can't make an enzyme called alpha-galactosidase A, which you need to break down fatty substances like oils, waxes, and fatty acids. When you have Fabry disease, you either were born without that enzyme or it doesn't work right. You may notice things like: Pain and burning in your hands and feet that get worse with exercise, fever, and hot weather or when you are tired Small, dark red spots usually found between your belly button and knees Cloudy vision Hearing loss Ringing in the ears Sweating less than normal Stomach pain, bowel movements right after eating Fabry disease can lead to more serious problems, especially in men.

That's because the symptoms are common and can affect so many different parts of the body. If your family history suggests you could be at risk for Fabry disease, you may want to ask your doctor about getting genetic testing. When you see your doctor, he will do a physical exam and ask you questions like these: How are you feeling? If your doctor thinks it might be Fabry disease, he will ask you to either take a blood test so he can measure the level of alpha-galactosidase A, or take a DNA test. When your doctor says you have Fabry disease, that may be the first time you've heard of it. You probably have a lot of questions, especially if you've been trying to figure out for a long time what's causing your symptoms. You may want to start by asking your doctor questions like these: How did you diagnose Fabry disease? Are my children likely to get Fabry disease?

An enzyme deficiency will make the body unable to produce one or more of these hormones, which will result in the overproduction of another in order to compensate for the loss. CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is responsible for 95% of all cases of CAH and is broken down further into two subcategories: classical CAH, which can be divided further into the salt-losing form or the simple-virilizing form, and non-classical CAH. Since the absence of 21-hydroxylase makes these individuals unable to make the hormone cortisol and, in the case of salt-losing CAH, aldosterone, the body produces more androgens which cause a variety of symptoms such as abnormal sexual development. There are other much rarer forms of CAH as well, including 11-Beta hydroxylase deficiency, 17a-hydroxylase deficiency, 3-Beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency, and congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia, which all present different symptoms.

The extra fluid can increase pressure in the baby's brain , causing brain damage and mental and physical problems. But long-term effects mostly depend on what caused the fluid buildup, how bad it gets, and how the baby responds to treatment. This condition is caused by an imbalance between how much fluid the brain makes and how well the body is able to process it. Normally, fluid flows through and out of chambers of the brain called ventricles, and then around the brain and spinal cord. The fluid is then absorbed by the thin tissue around the brain and spinal cord. But with hydrocephalus, the fluid can't move where it needs to or is not absorbed as it should be. And in rare cases the brain makes too much fluid. Congenital hydrocephalus may happen because of: Bleeding in the fetus before birth. Certain infections in the mother, such as toxoplasmosis or syphilis. You and your doctor may notice it when the baby is born or within the first several months of life. It's normal for a baby's head to grow a lot during the first year. But with congenital hydrocephalus, the head may grow faster than the normal rate for a baby's height and weight. The condition may cause the soft spot (fontanelle) on your baby's head to feel firm or bulge out. Your doctor may suspect that your baby has congenital hydrocephalus if your baby's head is larger than normal. Your baby may need imaging tests, such as a CT scan, an MRI, or an ultrasound, that can give a picture of the brain with more detail. Treatment focuses on reducing the amount of fluid in the brain to relieve pressure. In most cases, the doctor places a flexible tube, called a shunt, in the brain to drain the fluid. The shunt carries fluid to another part of the body (usually the belly or the heart), which then absorbs the fluid. The shunt may stay in the brain for life, though it may have to be fixed or replaced later if it becomes blocked or infected. In ETV, a small hole is made in the deep part of the brain so that the fluid in the brain can flow freely. This may include medicines, a lumbar puncture (sometimes called a spinal tap), or a procedure to drain fluid from the brain until a shunt can be put in. If your child has any developmental problems or delays caused by damage to the brain, your doctor can help you find the care you need. Treatment will focus on the specific problems your child has. No matter what kind of treatment your child has had, you and your child's doctors will need to watch your child closely to make sure that the fluid in the brain continues to drain properly. Symptoms such as irritability, poor appetite, sleeping too much, and vomiting often may be signs that fluid has built up again in your child's brain. As your child grows, you'll need to watch for problems with brain development. And if your child has special needs, it can be a challenge to take care of him or her. And ask your doctor about support groups and organizations that can help."], [1922, "Hydrocele, Congenital", "A hydrocele (say \"HY-druh-seel\") is a buildup of watery fluid around one or both testicles. It causes the scrotum or groin area to swell. A congenital hydrocele is one that a baby is born with. The swelling from a hydrocele may look scary, but it is usually not a problem. A month or so before birth, a baby's testicles move from the belly area down into the scrotum, along with a bit of the lining of the belly area. The lining shrivels up, leaving a small empty space around the testicles. This space normally closes up by the time a baby is 2 years old. Sometimes fluid leaks into the space, filling it like a small water balloon. When the space closes up and traps the fluid inside, it's called a noncommunicating hydrocele. If the space doesn't close up the way it should, the fluid moves back and forth between the scrotum and the belly area. This problem is usually fixed with surgery to help prevent a hernia in the groin. Another type of hydrocele is a hydrocele of the spermatic cord. The fluid is usually absorbed within a few months and at the latest by age 1 or 2. A hydrocele of the cord may be mistaken for an inguinal hernia. Doctors diagnose a congenital hydrocele during a physical exam that includes questions about the child's health. The swelling is often easy to see, so the hydrocele is typically not hard to identify. Most of the time, all you need to do is watch for changes in the swelling. If the swelling gets bigger or if it comes and goes, tell your doctor. A small cut (incision) will be made in the groin area.

Yet researchers aren't sure if it's actually the act of laughing that makes people feel better. A good sense of humor, a positive attitude, and the support of friends and family might play a role, too. \"The definitive research into the potential health benefits of laughter just hasn't been done yet,\" says Robert R. Provine, professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and author of Laughter: A Scientific Investigation. People who believe in the benefits of laughter say it can be like a mild workout -- and may offer some of the same advantages as a workout. \"The effects of laughter and exercise are very similar,\" says Wilson. \"Combining laughter and movement, like waving your arms, is a great way to boost your heart rate.\" One pioneer in laughter research, William Fry, claimed it took ten minutes on a rowing machine for his heart rate to reach the level it would after just one minute of hearty laughter. Maciej Buchowski, a researcher from Vanderbilt University, conducted a small study in which he measured the amount of calories expended in laughing. One piece of chocolate has about 50 calories; at the rate of 50 calories per hour, losing one pound would require about 12 hours of concentrated laughter! In the last few decades, researchers have studied laughter's effects on the body and turned up some potentially interesting information on how it affects us: Blood flow. Researchers at the University of Maryland studied the effects on blood vessels when people were shown either comedies or dramas. After the screening, the blood vessels of the group who watched the comedy behaved normally -- expanding and contracting easily. Increased stress is associated with decreased immune system response, says Provine. One study of 19 people with diabetes looked at the effects of laughter on blood sugar levels. The focus on the benefits of laughter really began with Norman Cousin's memoir, Anatomy of an Illness. But things get murky when researchers try to sort out the full effects of laughter on our minds and bodies. \"I don't mean to sound like a curmudgeon,\" says Provine, \"but the evidence that laughter has health benefits is iffy at best.\" He says that most studies of laughter have been small and not well conducted. He also says too many researchers have an obvious bias: they go into the study wanting to prove that laughter has benefits. For instance, Provine says studies of laughing have often not looked at the effects of other, similar activities. \"It's not really clear that the effects of laughing are distinct from screaming,\" Provine says. Provine says that the most convincing health benefit he's seen from laughter is its ability to dull pain. One of the biggest problems with laughter research is that it's very difficult to determine cause and effect. Or researchers might find that, among a group of people with the same disease, people who laugh more have more energy. So it becomes very hard to say if laughter is actually an agent of change, or just a sign of a person's underlying condition. Laughter, Provine believes, is part of a larger picture. \"Laughter is social, so any health benefits might really come from being close with friends and family, and not the laughter itself.\" In his own research, Provine has found that we're thirty times more likely to laugh when we're with other people than when we're alone. \"Laughing more could make you healthier, but we don't know,\" he tells WebMD. \"I certainly wouldn't want people to start laughing more just to avoid dying -- because sooner or later, they'll be disappointed.\" So Wilson and Provine agree that regardless of whether laughter actually improves your health or boosts your energy, it undeniably improves your quality of life. \"I'm just saying that if we enjoy laughing, isn't that reason enough to laugh?"], [1927, "Human Monocytic Ehrlichiosis (HME)", "Human Monocytic Ehrlichiosis (HME) is a rare infectious disease belonging to a group of diseases known as the Human Ehrlichioses.

The male condom is a barrier method of birth control. Condoms are currently the only male method of birth control besides vasectomy. Some condoms are lubricated, some are ribbed, and some have a \"reservoir tip\" for holding the semen. The male condom has a user failure rate (typical use) of 18%. This means that, among all couples that use condoms, 18 out of 100 become pregnant in 1 year. Among couples who use condoms perfectly for 1 year, only 2 out of 100 will become pregnant.1 The most common reason for failure, besides not using a condom every time, is that the condom breaks or partially or completely slips off the penis. Use emergency contraception as a backup if a condom breaks or slips off. Make sure to check the condom's expiration date, and do not use it if past that date. Condoms are often used to reduce the risk of STIs even when the couple is using another method of birth control (such as pills). For the best protection, use the condom during vaginal, oral, or anal sex. \"Natural\" or sheep intestine condoms are as effective as latex or polyurethane condoms for preventing pregnancy, but they are not effective against STIs because the small openings in the animal tissue allow organisms to pass through. Condoms are most effective if you follow these steps: Use a new condom each time you have sexual intercourse. When opening the condom wrapper, be careful not to poke a hole in the condom with your fingernails, teeth, or other sharp objects. Before putting it on, hold the tip of the condom and squeeze out the air to leave room for the semen after ejaculation. If you aren't circumcised, pull down the loose skin from the head of the penis (foreskin) before putting on the condom. While continuing to hold on to the tip of the condom, unroll it all the way down to the base of your penis. If you are also using the condom as birth control, make sure your partner uses a spermicide according to the manufacturer's instructions. (Although the use of a spermicide increases the effectiveness of a condom as birth control, the use of a spermicide may increase the risk for transmitting HIV). Oil (or petroleum) can weaken the condom, increasing the chance that it may break. Instead, use a personal lubricant such as Astroglide or K-Y Jelly. After ejaculation, hold on to the condom at the base of your penis and withdraw from your partner while your penis is still erect. Store it in a cool, dry place out of direct sunlight. Don't keep rubber (latex) condoms in a glove compartment or other hot places for a long time. Heat weakens latex and increases the chance that the condom will break. Don't use condoms in damaged packages or condoms that show obvious signs of deterioration, such as brittleness, stickiness, or discoloration, regardless of their expiration date. Both partners must be comfortable with using a condom and be prepared to use one every time they have sex. These couples should use condoms made of polyurethane (plastic). Failure rates for barrier methods are higher than for most other methods of birth control. Using an additional method of birth control is a good backup measure in case a condom breaks. If a condom does break and you are using no other birth control method, you can use emergency contraception to help prevent pregnancy."], [1933, "How to Stop Thumb-Sucking", "Use a mirror to show your child the changes happening to his or her teeth or mouth shape. Talk about the unhealthy germs that are on our hands and how the child puts the germs in his or her mouth by thumb-sucking. Talk to your child about becoming a \"big boy\" or \"big girl\" by stopping thumb-sucking. Remind your child that he or she may be teased for continuing thumb-sucking. You may need to limit TV time since many children unconsciously suck their thumbs while watching TV. You may wish to use a bandage or a bad-tasting substance such as Thum that is painted on the fingernail to remind your child not to suck the thumb. If the bandage or coating comes off, replace it without being critical or embarrassing your child. It may take up to 3 months before your child is able to fall asleep without thumb-sucking. Try offering a favorite stuffed animal or putting a hand puppet on your child's hand at bedtime as a reminder. Gently explain to your child that if he or she continues to suck the thumb during the night, the habit will not go away and the changes to the mouth will continue to occur. Avoid putting your child in situations that are upsetting while he or she is trying to break the thumb-sucking habit. Set a goal for how long your child will try to go without thumb-sucking. Let your child pick a reward for reaching that goal. Rewards might be small toys, markers, a favorite treat, or a privilege like a trip to the park. During the second week, use a calendar or a progress chart that identifies the days of the week. Try using gentle reminders such as placing a bandage on the thumb so your child is aware when the thumb goes in his or her mouth. You can also try using fingernail coating made for stopping thumb-sucking, such as Thum. Be sure to let your child know the coating is not punishment but merely a reminder not to suck the thumb. If your child is insecure, has any emotional problems, or is under stress and needs comforting, you may need to resolve those issues first before your child will succeed at stopping thumb-sucking. If your child continues thumb-sucking, you may want to speak to a pediatrician or dentist to learn about devices (such as a thumb guard) that can be tried to prevent thumb-sucking."], [1934, "How to Stop Drinking Alcohol", "Prevent or reduce health problems that are made worse by alcohol use, such as liver damage. Prevent harm to your unborn baby if you are pregnant. Increase your ability to be productive at work, school, and home. Reduce legal problems that you might have as a result of misuse of alcohol. Make a list of the reasons you want to cut down on or stop drinking alcohol(What is a PDF document?). You might want to ask a trusted friend or family member to help you make the list complete. Keep this list so that you can renew your commitment from time to time. Make a plan to stop drinking alcohol(What is a PDF document?). Post it in a place where you can see it often, such as on your refrigerator door or bathroom mirror. You also might want to put it on a card and keep it in your purse or wallet. In your plan, identify when you will evaluate your progress. Review your reasons for stopping alcohol use. Begin again, using your experience to help you learn how to stick with your plan this time. Like anything else in life, it is not easy to change behavior, even when it might be in your best interest. If you try this plan but are not successful, talk with your doctor about other ways to stop drinking alcohol. If your current life revolves around alcohol use, you might need to choose new friends or a new lifestyle. To stay focused on your goal and succeed, think through ideas to help you stop using alcohol on your own. For example, make a list of people and places in your life that have nothing to do with alcohol use. If you are not sure whether a self-help group is for you but would like to try, go to a group at least 3 times before you make your decision. Go to another group if the first one does not fit your needs. Use the money that you are no longer spending on drinking to do something fun with your family or friends.

Although this amount of bleeding may be alarming, many times the injury is not severe and the bleeding will stop with treatment you can do at home. If a cut from a head injury is deep enough to have penetrated the skull, emergency treatment is needed. Signs of deformity may include sunken areas, visible bone fragments, or exposed brain. Before you try to stop the bleeding: Wash your hands well with soap and water (if available).If treating another person's wound, put on latex gloves, if you have them, before applying pressure to the wound. If gloves are not available, use several layers of fabric or plastic bags between your hand and the wound. Wash your hands well with soap and water (if available). If treating another person's wound, put on latex gloves, if you have them, before applying pressure to the wound. If gloves are not available, use several layers of fabric or plastic bags between your hand and the wound. Press firmly on the wound with gauze, a clean cloth, or the cleanest material available. If there is an object in the wound that you can't remove, apply pressure around the object, not directly over it. If moderate to severe bleeding has not slowed or stopped, continue direct pressure while getting help. Mild bleeding usually stops on its own or slows to an ooze or trickle after 15 minutes of pressure. It may ooze or trickle for up to 45 minutes. Watch for signs of shock, which is a life-threatening situation that requires emergency care. Signs of shock (most of which will be present) include: Passing out (losing consciousness).Feeling very dizzy or lightheaded, like you may pass out.Feeling very weak or having trouble standing up.Being less alert.

The condition is most common in newborns, though older boys and men can get it, too. It may sound or look serious, even painful, but don't worry, it won't hurt your baby. It might even go away on its own, though you should still see the doctor about it. Normally, the tunnel and the sac seal off before birth, and the baby's body absorbs the fluid inside. When this process doesn't go as it should, he can get a hydrocele. There are two types: Noncommunicating hydrocele happens when the sac closes like normal, but the boy's body doesn't absorb the fluid inside it. Communicating hydrocele happens when the sac doesn't seal. Even if he's not in pain, you should see the pediatrician to make sure he doesn't have other health problems that are causing the swelling, such as an infection, a tumor, or a hernia. The swelling from a noncommunicating hydrocele doesn't change in size. A communicating hydrocele can get bigger during the day, and if you gently squeeze it, the fluid will move out of the scrotum and into his belly. She'll check his scrotum for fluid and tenderness, and she'll shine a light through it to see if there's fluid around his testicle. A hydrocele usually goes away on its own before a boy's first birthday. If it doesn't, or if it gets bigger, you should take him back to his doctor to see if he needs treatment. If your son has a communicating hydrocele, the pediatrician will usually recommend surgery without waiting for it to go away. The surgeon then drains the fluid and sews the sac closed. After a few days, you may need to take him back to the doctor to make sure he's healing well."], [1937, "How to Improve Your Sleep", "Lots of things affect how well you sleep. You can use a sleep journal to help you figure out what helps and also what may get in the way of a good night's sleep. Changing one or more of your habits may improve how well you sleep. Limit caffeine (coffee, tea, caffeinated sodas) during the day, and don't have any for at least 4 to 6 hours before bedtime. You may fall asleep with no problems, but drinking alcohol before bed can wake you up later in the night. But don't drink so much that you have to get up often to urinate during the night. Wake up at the same time each day, including weekends, even if you haven't slept well. Don't exercise within 3 to 4 hours of bedtime, because the activity can make it hard to get to sleep. Get plenty of sunlight in the outdoors, especially in the morning and in late afternoon. Set aside time for problem solving earlier in the day so that you don't carry anxious thoughts to bed. Keep a notepad by your bed to write down any thoughts or worries that may keep you up or wake you up during the night. Try to not use technology such as smartphones, computers, or tablet devices in the hours before bed. The light from these devices and the emotions that can result from checking email or social media sites can make it harder to unwind and fall asleep. Reserve the bed for sleep and sex. A bit of light reading may help you fall asleep. Be sure your bed is big enough to stretch out comfortably, especially if you have a sleep partner. Use earplugs or sleep in a different room if your partner's snoring keeps you awake. If you notice that your partner is sleeping on his or her back, turn your partner to his or her side. You may also want to encourage your partner to see a doctor to find out what may be causing him or her to snore. Reduce the noise in the house, or mask it with a steady low noise, such as a fan on slow speed or a radio tuned to static. If you can't darken the room, use a sleep mask. If watching the clock makes you anxious about sleep, turn the clock so you can't see it, or put it in a drawer. Don't use tobacco, especially near bedtime and/or if you wake up during the night. If you can't fall asleep, or if you wake up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep within 15 minutes or so, get out of bed and go to another room until you feel sleepy."], [1938, "How to Avoid Outdoor Allergy Triggers", "Watch local weather reports for pollen counts in your area. They then begin to increase and are usually highest at midday and throughout the afternoon. Use air conditioning to help lower the amount of pollen that gets inside your house. Do not use a fan with an open window, as this can bring more pollen into your home. If this is not possible, use antihistamines before you mow, and wear a pollen or dust mask while you mow. Avoid bringing pollen back into your home when you go outdoors. Take a shower and change clothing after you work or play outside.Dry your clothes in a vented dryer. Take your vacation during the peak of the pollen season in a place where the plants you are allergic to don't grow. Avoid going outside on rainy or windy days when mold spores may be in the air. Avoid activities that expose you to molds, such as gardening (especially working with compost), mowing the lawn, or raking leaves. Remove excess leaves, grass clippings, and compost from the areas close to your home. Use products available in auto supply stores to reduce mold that can develop in your car air conditioner."], [1939, "How to Allergy-Proof Your Environment", "Medicines help treat allergy symptoms once they strike. Keep windows closed and run the air conditioner if you're allergic to pollen. Cover air conditioning vents with cheesecloth to trap pollen. Use HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filters, and clean them often. Keep the humidity in your home below 50% to help prevent mold growth. If you have pets, consider keeping them outside. If your allergies are severe, you might ask someone else to take care of them. If you decide to keep your pets inside, don't let them in your bedroom. They're easy to use and will let you know how much mold is in your home. If there's a lot, you can work to get rid of it, especially in the rooms where you spend most of your time. Air out damp clothes and shoes inside before you store them. Remove laundry from the washing machine promptly. Don't leave wet clothes in the washer, where mold can quickly grow. Soil encourages mold growth. Use plastic covers for pillows, mattresses, and box springs. Wear a mask and gloves when you clean, vacuum, or paint. That will limit your exposure to dust and chemicals. Limit how many throw rugs you keep to reduce dust and mold. If you must have carpet, go with a low-pile opting. Install an exhaust fan over your stove to remove cooking fumes. Keep windows closed, and set the air conditioner to use recirculated air if you're allergic to pollen. Take fewer walks in wooded areas or gardens. Try to avoid extreme temperature changes -- they can triggers asthma. Wear a mask (a cheap painter's mask is OK) when you mow if you're allergic to grass pollen or mold. It smells great, but keep your distance from freshly cut grass, too, if you can. Don't rake leaves or work with hay or mulch if you're allergic to mold. When you come back inside, take a shower, wash your hair, and change your clothes. To protect yourself from insect stings, wear shoes, long pants, and sleeves. Don't use scented deodorants, perfumes, shampoos, or hair products. Pack medicines in your carry-on bag. Bring an extra supply of meds in case you need them. Remove feather pillows and ask for synthetic, nonallergenic pillows. If possible, keep the vent on the room air conditioner shut. Read menus carefully and ask your sever how the dish is made. If your doctor has prescribed two, keep them both nearby. Discuss your child's allergies with the staff. If she has food allergies, tell the front office, her teachers, and lunchroom workers. That'll make her less likely to eat something that will trigger an allergic reaction. Leave one or two epinephrine kits at the school. Make sure the staff, and your child -- when she's old enough -- are able to use it correctly. Make sure the school has doses of anything she needs.

Hospice care also helps family members manage the practical details and emotional challenges of caring for a dying loved one. The goal is to keep you comfortable and improve your quality of life. Hospice programs offer services in your own home or in a hospice center. Some hospices also offer services in nursing homes, long-term care facilities, or hospitals. Some people think that starting hospice is a last resort, that it means they're giving up on life. Some think that hospice means a lower level of medical care. But hospice is simply a type of care that focuses on the quality of your life instead of on continuing with treatment to prolong your life. During the often difficult last stages of a serious illness, many people feel that they have lost control over their lives and over what will happen to them. Hospice services usually include: Basic medical care with a focus on pain and symptom control. Access to a member of your hospice team 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Medical supplies and equipment as needed. Counseling and social support to help you and your family with psychological, emotional, and spiritual issues. Guidance with the difficult, but normal, issues of life completion and closure. A break (respite care) for caregivers, family, and others who regularly care for you. Volunteer support, such as preparing meals and running errands. Counseling and support for your loved ones after you die. Most of the time, hospice care is provided in your home. Family members or loved ones may look after you much of the time. The hospice team will work with them to give you the best care possible. Someone from your hospice team will likely visit you for an hour or so once a week or more. In addition to a doctor and nurses, hospice teams usually include: Social workers. But he or she can work with others on your team to stay involved in your care. Usually, these two things must be true for you to be eligible for hospice care: Your condition cannot be cured.

You may hear these terms: Curative treatment, which is any medical treatment that is given to cure your disease or to try to help you live longer. Palliative care, which helps to provide relief from pain and any other symptoms you may have with your disease. The palliative care team will help coordinate your medical care with other doctors and help you with medical decisions. Palliative care also provides emotional and spiritual support for you and your loved ones. Hospice care, which provides palliative care for people who are close to the end of life. To be prepared: Decide what kind of health care you want or don't want. For example, you can decide whether you want CPR if your heart or breathing stops. A living will is a legal document that expresses your wishes for medical care if you are not able to speak or make decisions for yourself. A medical power of attorney lets you choose a health care agent. Your health care agent will have the legal right to make treatment decisions for you, not only at the end of your life but anytime you are not able to speak for yourself. One thing to think about is what type of medical care you want. For example, palliative care may include giving you medicines to help with pain or with the side effects from treatment. Palliative care team members may also provide physical therapy or help you if you are having problems such as anxiety or loss of appetite from chemotherapy. You can get palliative care to help keep you comfortable, and you can take medicines or other treatments that might cure you. A time may come when you decide to stop curative treatment if it is very clear that your illness can't be cured. And if your condition changes, you can start curative treatment again. But if your illness is expected to get worse, you may want to plan ahead for that time by talking with your doctor. Hospice care is for people who are close to the end of life and are not likely to live for more than 6 months. If you have only a few months left, you may choose to receive care through hospice. Hospice services are provided by a team of people that includes doctors, nurses, and volunteers. The team gives palliative care and emotional and spiritual support to people near the end of life and to their families. It may offer practical support like running errands or fixing meals. You can get hospice care in your home or in a hospice center, hospital, or nursing home. The costs are usually covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance.

A stye is an infection that causes a tender red lump on the eyelid. When a stye occurs inside the eyelid, it is called an internal hordeolum (say \"hor-dee-OH-lum\"). Chalazia (plural) may look like styes, but they are usually larger and may not hurt. Styes and chalazia may be related to blepharitis, a common problem that causes inflammation of the eyelids. Usually the bacteria grow in the root (follicle) of an eyelash. If an internal hordeolum doesn't drain and heal, it can turn into a chalazion. As the stye grows, the eyelid becomes swollen and painful, and the eye may water. Most styes swell for about 3 days before they break open and drain. A chalazion starts as a firm lump or cyst under the skin of the eyelid. Unlike styes, chalazia often don't hurt. The inflammation and swelling may spread to the area surrounding the eye. It may be hard to tell the difference between a stye and a chalazion. Home treatment is all that is needed for most styes and chalazia. Try an ointment (such as Stye), solution (such as Bausch and Lomb Eye Wash), or medicated pads (such as Ocusoft Lid Scrub). Let the stye or chalazion open on its own. Don't wear eye makeup or contact lenses until the area has healed. If a stye is not getting better with home treatment, talk to your doctor. You may need a prescription for antibiotic eye ointment or eyedrops. You may need to take antibiotic pills if infection has spread to the eyelid or eye. If a stye or chalazion gets very large, the doctor may need to pierce (lance) it so it can drain and heal. If you need to touch your eyes, wash your hands first. Protect your eyes from dust and air pollution when you can. Replace eye makeup, especially mascara, at least every 6 months.

The disease raises your chances of a heart attack at an early age, but drugs and other treatments can lower your risk. LDL's job is to carry cholesterol around your body in your bloodstream. When you have high levels of LDL, cholesterol builds up in your arteries, the blood vessels that supply oxygen to your heart. The cholesterol can eventually block them and shut off the flow of blood and oxygen to your heart, causing a heart attack. There's no cure, so you'll need to take drugs and follow a heart-healthy diet throughout your life. Your doctor may need to do a bit of \"trial and error\" until he finds the right drug combination to manage your high cholesterol. If drugs and diet aren't helping, there's another treatment that takes blood from your body, removes the cholesterol, and then returns the blood back to you. For some people, this treatment still won't keep cholesterol under control. It's major surgery with a lot of recovery time, so it's important to reach out to family and friends to get the emotional support you need. When you have homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, you inherit two copies of a gene that isn't working right, one from each of your parents. These receptors attach to LDL cholesterol and play a key role in keeping your cholesterol levels under control. The main sign that you have this condition is very high levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. For instance, you may have a total cholesterol level of 600 points or higher. You may have yellow, waxy patches on your skin over the elbows, knees, and buttocks. Also, you can get gray or white circles around your cornea, the clear front part of the eye. Some symptoms of heart disease you may have include: Chest pain (angina) Rapid heartbeat Shortness of breath Your doctor will do a physical exam and also take some blood tests. To help make a diagnosis, he may ask you: Have you noticed any yellowish patches on your skin? Your doctor will check your cholesterol levels by taking a blood sample and sending it to a lab to be analyzed. Your doctor might also want to test some of your close relatives to see if they have the disease. If diet and drugs don't lower my cholesterol, are there other treatments that can help? The goal is to lower your LDL cholesterol levels, and your risk for heart disease. Your doctor will probably recommend that you stick to a diet that's low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and sugar. He may need to try different combinations of drugs and treatments until he finds one that works best for you. Since homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia raises your cholesterol to extremely high levels, your doctor may start you on high doses of statin drugs. Your doctor may also try combining statins with other drugs that lower the amount of cholesterol that gets into your body from the food you eat. Statins may also be combined with drugs that help reduce the amount of cholesterol that moves through your blood. Some examples are Colestid, Prevalite, and Welchol. These drugs lower LDL cholesterol and are meant to be used together with a low-fat diet and other medicines that lower your cholesterol. If different combinations of medicine aren't doing the job, your doctor may ask you to try a treatment called apheresis. You go to a clinic or hospital where some of your blood is removed through a tube called a catheter. LDL cholesterol is taken out of your blood before it's returned to your body. The procedure takes several hours, and you'll need to do it regularly. The new liver will have normal LDL receptors that will remove the bad cholesterol from your blood. A liver transplant is major surgery, and it could take you 6 months to a year before you can return to your regular lifestyle. After your transplant, you'll need to take drugs that prevent your body from rejecting the new liver. If you're considering a liver transplant, you'll probably need to get some emotional support from family and friends. Ask your doctor about educational workshops that can help explain what to expect before and after a transplant. Practice smart lifestyle habits to lower your risk of heart disease. Eat a diet that's mostly fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, seafood, lean poultry, and low-fat dairy. Also, keep the fat in your diet to 30% or less of your daily calories. For example, if you eat 2,000 calories a day, you should eat no more than 65 grams of fat a day. Try to avoid or limit sources of saturated fat and cholesterol, such as: Red meat Butter Whole milk Coconut and palm oils Egg yolks Try to exercise every day, which also will help control your cholesterol levels. While your doctor is trying to find the treatment that works best, you'll probably need to make regular visits to get blood tests to check your cholesterol levels. Sometimes your doctor might need to try several different things before your high cholesterol gets under control. Make sure you keep up with the drugs your doctor prescribes, and keep eating a healthy diet. You can also join a support group to get ideas and help from other people who know what you're going through."], [1945, "HPV/Genital Warts How Do I Know If I Have HPV?", "But some types of HPV can lead to cervical cancer or cancer of the anus or penis. The term \"papilloma\" refers to a kind of wart that results from some HPV types. HPV lives in thin, flat cells called epithelial cells. They're also found on the surface of the vagina, anus, vulva, cervix and head of the penis. About 60 of the 100 HPV types cause warts on areas like the hands or feet. They're drawn to the body's mucus membranes, such as the moist layers around the anus and genitals. Not all of the 40 sexually transmitted HPV viruses cause serious health problems. High-risk HPV strains include HPV 16 and 18, which cause about 70% of cervical cancers. Other high-risk HPV viruses include 31, 33, 45, 52, 58, and a few others. Low-risk HPV strains, such as HPV 6 and 11, cause about 90% of genital warts, which rarely develop into cancer. Often, there are no symptoms of an HPV infection, and the body clears the infection on its own in a few years. But sometimes an infection with high-risk types of HPV will last longer. This can cause changes in the cells of the cervix that could lead to cancer. The same thing could cause abnormal changes in cells of the penis and anus, but this is rare. You can get HPV through sex (vaginal, anal, or oral). The only way to avoid all risk of any type of HPV infection is to never be sexually active -- no vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Three vaccines -- Cervarix, Gardasil, and Gardasil-9 -- protect against HPV. The vaccines focus on some of the higher-risk types of HPV. All three guard against HPV 16 and 18. Gardasil and Gardasil-9 are also effective against HPV 6 and 11, which cause most genital warts. Gardasil-9 also covers against the high-risk strains 31, 33, 45, 52, 58."], [1946, "Homozygous Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Deficiency", "Also called AAT deficiency, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disease, which means it's passed down from your parents. It can also cause liver disease that leads to jaundice, which makes your skin look yellowish. There's no cure, but treatments can help you manage your liver and breathing problems. You get the disease because your liver doesn't make enough of a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin, or AAT. Without it, infections and other irritants, like tobacco smoke, break down parts of your lung even faster. If you have AAT deficiency, you might not have any breathing symptoms until you're in your 20s or 30s. But when they start, you could feel short of breath or wheeze when you breathe, just like someone who has asthma. When you have COPD, you often have symptoms of emphysema, a serious condition that makes it hard for you to push air out of your lungs. COPD can make you cough up mucus, make you wheeze or have trouble breathing, and make your chest feel tight. You also might have chronic bronchitis, an irritation of your airways that makes you cough a lot and have trouble breathing. You'll probably need to take medicine through an inhaler that you carry around, like the type that people with asthma use. With treatment, you'll probably still be able to work, exercise, and enjoy many of your favorite hobbies. Reach out to a circle of friends and family, and ask your doctor about support groups. The broken genes you get from your parents cause you to have a low level of AAT protein in your blood. It can build up in the liver instead of going into your bloodstream. You might not know you have the disease until you're an adult, between the ages of 20 and 40. You may feel short of breath, especially when you try to exercise. You also may start to wheeze or have a whistling sound when you breathe. Other warning signs include: Feeling tired Your heart beats fast when you stand up Weight loss If AAT deficiency causes problems with your liver, you might have symptoms like: Yellowish skin or eyes Swollen belly or legs Coughing up blood A newborn baby might have jaundice, or a yellow coloring of the skin or eyes, very yellow urine, poor weight gain, an enlarged liver, and bleeding from the nose or umbilical stump. In rare cases, a skin disease called panniculitis causes hardening of the skin with painful lumps or patches. Your doctor will also listen to your breathing with a stethoscope to check for wheezing or other signs that your lungs aren't working right. These tests check to see if you have the broken genes that cause AAT deficiency. They also look to see how much of the protein you have in your bloodstream. Your doctor will also order tests of your lungs and liver to see how much damage the condition has caused. A special blood test checks the oxygen level in your arteries, a sign of how well your lungs work. Another blood test checks for problems with your liver. You may also get a liver biopsy, in which your doctor uses a very thin needle to take some cells from your liver and check for signs of damage. Although there's no cure for AAT deficiency, you can raise the amount of AAT protein in your blood, which protects you against more lung damage. You get a new supply of AAT protein that comes from the blood of healthy human donors. You can have this done at home with the help of a technician, or you can go to a doctor's office. Depending on how you're doing, you also may get medication that you breathe into your lungs with an inhaler. If your breathing trouble leads to low levels of oxygen in your blood, you might need to get extra oxygen through a mask or nosepiece. You shouldn't smoke, and you need to get a pneumonia vaccine and your annual flu shot. Good nutrition -- including supplements with vitamins E, D, and K -- can help you keep your liver healthy. Babies with AAT deficiency may need a special milk formula or extra vitamins. Support from your loved ones, and from others who have the same condition, also makes a big difference, so you know there are people who understand what you're going through. Some people have severe problems, but others may have few or no symptoms. In babies and children, the condition is more likely to cause liver damage than lung problems. Still, only about 10% of children with it have severe liver disease. You'll be more sensitive to smoke and dust, and even the common cold can lead to breathing problems. About 30% to 40% of people with this condition will have liver problems at some point in their lives. Finding out if you have AAT deficiency is the first step toward the healthy habits and medical treatments that help control the disease. You can find names of doctors, links to support groups, genetic counseling resources, and other information from the Alpha-1 Foundation website."], [1947, "Homocystinuria", "Homocystinuria is a rare metabolic condition characterized by an excess of the compound homocystine in the urine. The condition may result from deficiency of any of several enzymes involved in the conversion of the essential amino acid methionine to another amino acid (cysteine)--or, less commonly, impaired conversion of the compound homocysteine to methionine. Certain amino acids, which are the chemical building blocks of proteins, are essential for proper growth and development. In most cases, homocystinuria is caused by reduced activity of an enzyme known as cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). These may include partial dislocation (subluxation) of the lens of the eyes (ectopia lentis), associated \"quivering\" (iridodonesis) of the colored region of the eyes (iris), severe nearsightedness (myopia), and other eye (ocular) abnormalities. In addition, some may develop psychiatric disturbances and/or episodes of uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain (seizures). In addition, affected individuals may be at risk for the development of blood clots that can become lodged within certain large and small blood vessels (thromboembolisms), potentially leading to life-threatening complications."], [1948, "Homeopathy", "Homeopathy, or homeopathic medicine, is a medical philosophy and practice based on the idea that the body has the ability to heal itself. Homeopathy was founded in the late 1700s in Germany and has been widely practiced throughout Europe. Homeopathic medicine views symptoms of illness as normal responses of the body as it attempts to regain health. That is, if a substance causes a symptom in a healthy person, giving the person a very small amount of the same substance may cure the illness. A homeopathic health practitioner (homeopath) uses pills or liquid mixtures (solutions) containing only a little of an active ingredient (usually a plant or mineral) for treatment of disease. Historically, people have used homeopathy to maintain health and treat a wide range of long-term illnesses, such as allergies, atopic dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and irritable bowel syndrome. They have also used it to treat minor injuries, such as cuts and scrapes and muscle strains or sprains. Homeopathic treatment is not considered appropriate for illnesses, such as cancer, heart disease, major infections, or emergencies. Homeopathy has been widely used in India, England, and other European countries. Homeopathic remedies have been regulated in the United States since 1938 and are considered to be safe.

If you have an enlarged, painless lymph node that your doctor suspects may be due to Hodgkin lymphoma, tissue will be taken for biopsy or the entire node will be removed. The diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma is sometimes confirmed by the presence of a type of cell called a Reed-Sternberg cell. If a biopsy reveals that you do have Hodgkin lymphoma, you may need additional tests to determine the extent, or stage, of the disease. Tests include blood tests, chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, and possibly the neck, and PET scans. These tests will reveal the stage of the Hodgkin lymphoma and determine the best type of therapy. The prognosis and specific treatment used to treat Hodgkin depends on the stage of the disease or how widespread it is. Here are the stages of the disease: Stage I. Hodgkin lymphoma is found in only one lymph node area or structure (such as the spleen). Hodgkin lymphomais found in two or more lymph node areas on the same side of the diaphragm (the muscle beneath the lungs that moves up and down to help you breathe). Hodgkinlymphoma is in lymph nodes on both sides of the diaphragm, or the cancer may also have extended to an area or organ adjacent to the lymph node or to the spleen. The goal of treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma is to eradicate the lymphoma cells without damaging normal cells in order to minimize treatment side effects. Patients with Hodgkin lymphoma that is resistant to treatment or returns after initial treatment may need autologous stem cell transplantation. In this procedure, higher doses of chemotherapy or total body irradiation are applied in an effort to destroy Hodgkin lymphoma cells that have survived standard therapy. A new drug, brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris), is designed to treat patients whose lymphoma has progressed after treatment with bone marrow stem cell transplantation or those who have had two chemotherapy treatments and are not eligible for transplant. It's the first new drug approved to treat Hodgkin lymphoma in over 35 years. The five-year survival rate refers to the percentage of patients, according to the stage of their disease at diagnosis, who live at least five years after treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma.

Familial: Same-sex siblings and an identical twin of a person with Hodgkin lymphoma are at high risk of developing the disease.

Hives usually cause itching, but may also burn or sting. Angioedema is similar to hives, but the swelling occurs beneath the skin instead of on the surface. Angioedema is characterized by deep swelling around the eyes and lips and sometimes of the genitals, hands, and feet. It generally lasts longer than hives, but the swelling usually goes away in less than 24 hours. Rarely, angioedema of the throat, tongue, or lungs can block the airways, causing difficulty breathing. Allergic hives and angioedema form when, in response to histamine, blood plasma leaks out of small blood vessels in the skin. There are several different types of hives, including: Acute urticaria: Hives lasting less than six weeks. Drugs that can cause hives and angioedema include aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen, high blood pressure drugs (ACE inhibitors), or painkillers such as codeine. Chronic urticaria and angioedema: Hives lasting more than six weeks. The cause of this type of hives is usually more difficult to identify than those causing acute urticaria. In some cases, though, the cause may be thyroid disease, hepatitis, infection, or cancer. Symptoms include muscle soreness, shortness of breath, vomiting, and diarrhea. Physical urticaria: Hives caused by direct physical stimulation of the skin -- for example, cold, heat, sun exposure, vibration, pressure, sweating, and exercise. The hives usually occur right where the skin was stimulated and rarely appear elsewhere. Dermatographism: This is a common form of physical urticaria where hives form after firmly stroking or scratching the skin. These hives can also occur along with other forms of urticaria. Your doctor will need to ask many questions in an attempt to find the possible cause of hives or angiodema. Since there are no specific tests for hives -- or the associated swelling of angioedema -- testing will depend on your medical history and a thorough exam by your primary care doctor or dermatologist. Chronic hives may be treated with antihistamines or a combination of medications. A biologic drug, omalizumab (Xolair), is also approved to treat chronic hives in those at least 12 years of age. For severe hive or angioedema outbreaks, an injection of epinephrine (adrenaline) or a cortisone medication may be needed. While you're waiting for hives and swelling to disappear, here are some tips: Apply cool compresses or wet cloths to the affected areas.

The hair is often dark and coarse, instead of the light, fine \"peach fuzz\" that covers most of the body. If your mother or sisters have it, you're more likely to get it. Many times, the condition is linked to high levels of male hormones (called androgens). But when these amounts are too high, they can cause hirsutism and other things, like acne, a deep voice, and small breasts. High levels of male hormones and hirsutism are common in women who have: Polycystic ovary syndrome , which causes small cysts, or fluid-filled sacs, to form on your ovaries. Cushing's syndrome, which you get when you have high levels of the stress hormone cortisol for long periods of time. Tumors in your adrenal glands (which make hormones like cortisol) or your ovaries. Some drugs can change the hormone levels in your system, so you grow unwanted hair on your face or body.

If you're overweight and drop pounds, your body should make fewer male hormones, so you should grow less hair on your face or body. You can remove unwanted hair easily with a razor or electric shaver. There are different ways to pluck hair out at the root. Or you can hire someone to \"thread\" -- use a long, tight strand to loop around and remove each unwanted hair. A quick way to remove lots of unwanted hair by the root is with melted wax. You apply the cream, let it sit for a while, and when you wipe it off, the hair goes with it. They can irritate sensitive skin, so test a small spot before you use one on a large area. You can remove hair for good with electrolysis, a pricey service that zaps hair at the root with an electric current. After you repeat the process a few times, hair should stop growing in treated areas. The heat from lasers can remove hair, but you need to repeat the process a few times, and it sometimes grows back. The treatment targets hair at the root, so it's painful and could damage or scar your skin. Doctors can prescribe drugs that change the way your body grows hair. When you stop using the medication, hair will grow back, though. With regular use, you should have less hair on your face or body.

This can lead to trapped stool, infection, pain and swelling, and bowel problems. Most of the time, the disease is found soon after birth. It occurs in about 1 out of every 5,000 newborns and is most common in male babies.1 In rare cases, the disease can be life-threatening. Symptoms can depend on how severe the problem is and how old the child is. Newborns with the disease may not pass their first stool until at least 48 hours after birth. A doctor may think that a child has the disease based on the child's symptoms and the results of a physical exam. Other tests may be done to confirm the diagnosis, such as: A tissue sample from the rectum (biopsy). If the muscles don't relax, it can sometimes be a sign of Hirschsprung's disease. Children with Hirschsprung's disease need surgery to remove the diseased part of the large intestine. Surgery is often done within the first days or month of life, soon after the disease is found. Treatment may involve one or two surgeries: The first surgery removes the damaged part of the intestine and may create a colostomy or ileostomy so that the intestine can heal. (With an ostomy, stool leaves the body through an opening in the belly and collects in a bag.) If your baby gets an ostomy during the first surgery (not all babies do), a second surgery will be done to close the ostomy. Most babies are in the hospital from a couple of days up to 1 week. Being involved in your baby's care while he or she is in the hospital may help you feel more comfortable when you take your baby home. Some children have long-term (chronic) problems with stomachaches and bowel problems after surgery. These include medicine, biofeedback, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and more surgery. In a few cases, emergency surgery may be needed if a dangerous problem such as serious swelling of the small and large intestines (enterocolitis) occurs."], [1964, "Hip Fracture", "If you are older, breaking your hip can mean a major change in your life. You will probably need surgery, and it can take as long as a year to recover. But activity and physical therapy can help you get your strength and mobility back. Most hip fractures happen to people who are 65 or older, and they are usually caused by falls. As you get older, your bones naturally lose some strength and are more likely to break, even from a minor fall. Children and young adults are more likely to break a hip because of a bike or car accident or a sports injury. Other things that increase your risk of breaking your hip include: Being female. Your family history-being thin or tall or having family members who had fractures later in life. Not getting enough calcium and vitamin D, which you need for strong bones. Weight-bearing exercise, such as walking, helps keep bones strong. Medical conditions that cause dizziness or problems with balance, or conditions such as arthritis that can interfere with steady and safe movement. If your hip is broken, you will most likely: Have severe pain in your hip or lower groin area. But if you have very thin bones from osteoporosis or another problem, you could break your hip without falling. In rare cases, people have only thigh or knee pain. You may need another test if your doctor thinks that you have a fracture but can't see it on an X-ray. You might have a test such as: An MRI, which gives better images of bones and soft tissues. A CT scan, another way of getting more detailed images. A bone scan, which involves injecting a dye, then taking images. It can show hairline fractures, where the bone is cracked but the pieces are still in place. Surgery usually works well, but your hip will probably take a long time to get better. Having surgery right away may help shorten your stay in the hospital and reduce pain and complications. The doctor uses metal screws, rods, or plates to hold the bone together while it heals. In a partial hip replacement, the doctor replaces the broken upper part of the thighbone. In a total hip replacement, both the hip socket and the top of the thigh bone are replaced. This will help prevent problems such as pneumonia, blood clots, and bed sores. After your surgery, it will be hard to do things like cooking and getting dressed by yourself. Your doctor will encourage you to take part in a rehab program that includes physical therapy and occupational therapy. This will teach you: Exercises to help you regain your strength and ability to move around. Taking part in a rehab program is very important because it will speed up your recovery and help you to get back to your normal activities sooner. After a hip fracture, some people aren't ever able to get around as well as they could before. Work hard to get your strength and mobility back so you can be as independent as possible. Bone thinning can happen to men or women. To keep your bones strong: Get plenty of calcium and vitamin D. Dairy foods like milk, cheese, and yogurt have lots of calcium. It's also in some vegetables like broccoli and kale. Vitamin D is in foods such as salmon, tuna, and fortified milk and cereals. If you want to take supplements, ask your doctor how much you need. If your doctor prescribes medicine to slow osteoporosis, take it as directed. Here are a few ways to make your home safer: Keep walkways clear of electrical cords and clutter. It can also help to: Get your eyes checked on a regular basis. And from time to time, ask your primary care doctor to review your medicines. Some medicines, such as sleeping pills or pain relievers, can increase your risk of falling."], [1965, "Hip Dysplasia, Developmental", "Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a hip problem a baby is born with or that happens in the first year of life. In this condition, the top of the thighbone doesn't fit securely into the hip socket. This problem may affect one or both hip joints. But in DDH , the hip socket may be too shallow or the tissues around the joint may be too loose. In mild cases, the ligaments and other soft tissues aren't tight, so the thighbone (femur) moves around more than normal in the hip socket. In more severe cases, the hip socket is more like a saucer than the deep cup that it should be. As a result:The ball at the top of the thighbone (femoral head) may slip partway out of the hip socket. The femoral head may slide completely out of the hip socket. The longer it goes on, the more likely it is to cause long-term hip problems. The exact cause of DDH is not known. But some things can raise your child's chances of having it, including: Having a family history of DDH. DDH isn't painful, and your baby may not have any obvious signs of a hip defect. It is usually diagnosed during a newborn's physical exam. A doctor will move the baby's legs and look and listen for signs of a problem. If your baby is older, your doctor may diagnose DDH during the physical exam at a well-baby checkup. That's because the only outward sign may be a hip joint that is less mobile or flexible than normal. If the doctor suspects DDH but the results of a physical exam aren't clear, your child might need to have an imaging test of the hip joint, such as an ultrasound or X-ray. Your child's hip socket won't form and grow properly if the ball at the top of the thighbone doesn't fit snugly in the joint. Your child may need: A Pavlik harness . It holds your baby's legs in a spread position with the hips bent. The harness is able to make the hips normal most of the time. A hard cast, known as a spica cast . In some cases, this may be needed to correct a deformed thighbone or hip socket. A child who has surgery will probably need to wear a spica cast to position the hip joint until it heals. A child who has been in a spica cast may need to do exercises to regain movement and build muscle strength in the legs. If treatment is successful, your child probably won't have any further hip problems. But get your child's hips checked regularly to make sure they continue to grow and develop normally."], [1966, "Hip Dysplasia, Congenital", "A hip problem can be hard to deal with, both for the child who has the problem and to the parent or caregiver. A child who has a hip problem may feel pain in the hip, groin, thigh, or knee. A child in pain may limp or be unable or unwilling to stand, walk, or move the affected leg. To better understand hip problems, it may be helpful to know how the hip works. The thighbone (femur) fits tightly into a cup-shaped socket (acetabulum) in the pelvis. The hip joint is tighter and more stable than the shoulder joint but it does not move as freely. The hip joint is held together by muscles in the buttock, groin, and spine; tendons; ligaments; and a joint capsule. Oddly enough, a child who has a hip problem often feels pain in the knee or thigh instead of the hip. Hip problems that affect children include: An inflammatory reaction, such as transient or toxic synovitis. This generally occurs after the child has had a cold or other upper respiratory infection. This occurs when the upper end of the thighbone (head of the femur) slips at the growth plate (epiphysis) and does not fit in the hip socket correctly. This condition is caused by decreased blood flow to the head of the femur which affects the bone as seen on the X-ray and an MRI of a child with this problem. The child will have a \"pigeon-toed\" appearance and may have a clumsy walk. This condition is caused by a problem in the development of the hip joint. This condition causes inflamed, swollen joints that are often stiff and painful. Treatment for a hip problem depends on the location, type, and severity of the problem as well as the child's age, general health, and activity level. Check your child's symptoms to decide if and when your child should see a doctor."], [1967, "High Potassium", "Hyperkalemia is a condition caused by an abnormally high concentration of potassium in the blood. Potassium is a key element in contraction of muscles (including the heart) and for the functioning of many complicated proteins (enzymes). Potassium is found primarily in the skeletal muscle and bone, and participates with sodium to contribute to the normal flow between the body fluids and the cells of the body (homeostasis). Normally, 98% of the potassium in the body is found in the cells of various tissues, while only about 2% is circulating in the blood. When hyperkalemia occurs, it may come about because of an increase in total body potassium or as a result of increased release of potassium from the cells to the blood. Because potassium helps to regulate muscle activity, including the activity of heart (cardiac) muscle, hyperkalemia needs to be taken seriously."], [1968, "Hiccups", "A very full stomach can cause bouts of hiccups that go away on their own. A sudden change in stomach temperature, such as drinking a hot beverage and then a cold beverage. Hiccups that last longer than 48 hours are called persistent hiccups. Hiccups that last longer than a month are called intractable hiccups. While very rare, intractable hiccups can cause exhaustion, lack of sleep, and weight loss. Both persistent and intractable hiccups may be a sign of a more serious health problem and must be checked by a doctor. There are many known causes of persistent or intractable hiccups, including: Central nervous system problems, such as cancer, infections, stroke, or injury. Problems with the chemical processes that take place in the body (metabolic problems), such as decreased kidney function or hyperventilation. Irritation of the nerves in the head, neck, and chest (vagus or phrenic nerve). Many home remedies are used to treat hiccups. Most of them involve increasing the level of carbon dioxide in the blood, which usually stops hiccups. Some of these remedies include: Holding your breath and counting slowly to 10. The treatment for persistent or intractable hiccups depends on the underlying cause of the hiccups and may range from medicine to acupuncture or hypnosis. Sometimes several treatments may be tried before persistent or intractable hiccups are controlled. If you have hiccups that last a few days or longer, your doctor may conduct tests to rule out a more serious problem. Hiccups occur in practically every human being, including babies and older adults."], [1969, "Hiccough, Chronic", "On rare occasions, hiccups persist even longer than a month or recur frequently over an extended period of time. Sometimes, although not always, hiccups that persist may indicate the presence of another medical problem. Some illnesses for which continuing hiccups may be a symptom include: pleurisy of the diaphragm, pneumonia, uremia, alcoholism, disorders of the stomach or esophagus, and bowel diseases. Hiccups may also be associated with pancreatitis, pregnancy, bladder irritation, liver cancer or hepatitis. Surgery, tumors, and lesions may also cause persistent hiccups."], [1970, "Hiatal Hernia", "The hiatus is an opening in the diaphragm -- the muscular wall separating the chest cavity from the abdomen. In a hiatal hernia (also called hiatus hernia) the stomach bulges up into the chest through that opening. There are two main types of hiatal hernias: sliding and paraesophageal (next to the esophagus). In a sliding hiatal hernia, the stomach and the section of the esophagus that joins the stomach slide up into the chest through the hiatus. Although you can have this type of hernia without any symptoms, the danger is that the stomach can become \"strangled,\" or have its blood supply shut off. Many people with hiatal hernia have no symptoms, but others may have heartburn related to gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. Although there appears to be a link, one condition does not seem to cause the other, because many people have a hiatal hernia without having GERD, and others have GERD without having a hiatal hernia. People with heartburn may experience chest pain that can easily be confused with the pain of a heart attack. Increased pressure in the abdomen such as from pregnancy, obesity, coughing, or straining during bowel movements may also play a role. Hiatal hernias occur more often in women, people who are overweight, and people older than 50. A hiatal hernia can be diagnosed with a specialized X-ray (using a barium swallow) that allows a doctor to see the esophagus or with endoscopy. Other symptoms that may occur along with the hernia such as chest pain should be properly evaluated. If the hiatal hernia is in danger of becoming constricted or strangulated (so that the blood supply is cut off), surgery may be needed to reduce the hernia, meaning put it back where it belongs. Hiatal hernia surgery can often be performed as a laparoscopic, or \"minimally invasive,\" procedure. During this type of surgery, a few small (5 to 10 millimeter) incisions are made in the abdomen. The laparoscope that allows the surgeon to see inside the abdomen and surgical instruments are inserted through these incisions. Generally, there are no dietary restrictions and the patient can resume his or her regular activities within a week. If you have been diagnosed with a hiatal hernia and you develop severe pain in the chest or abdomen, become nauseated, are vomiting, or are unable to have a bowel movement or pass gas, you may have a strangulated hernia or an obstruction, which are medical emergencies."], [1971, "HHRH", "Summary Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare genetic disorder characterized the abnormal development of bones and teeth. These abnormalities occur due to defective mineralization, the process by which bones and teeth take up minerals such as calcium and phosphorus. The specific symptoms can vary greatly from one person to another, sometimes even among members of the same family. There are five major clinical forms of HPP that range from an extremely severe form that can cause stillbirth to a form associated with only premature loss of baby (deciduous) teeth, but no bone abnormalities. Hypophosphatasia is caused by mutations in the tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) gene. Depending on the specific form, hypophosphatasia can be inherited in an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant manner."], [1972, "HGE", "Human Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis (HGE) is a rare infectious disease that belongs to a group of diseases known as the Human Ehrlichioses. Several forms of Human Ehrlichial infection have been identified including Human Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis (HGE), Sennetsu Fever, and Human Monocytic Ehrlichiosis (HME). The symptoms of Human Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis (HGE) may include a sudden high fever, headache, muscle aches (myalgia), chills, and a general feeling of weakness and fatigue (malaise) within a week or so after initial infection. In some cases, symptoms may progress to include nausea, vomiting, cough, diarrhea, loss of appetite (anorexia), and/or confusion. The Ehrlichial bacterium is carried and transmitted by certain ticks (vectors), such as the deer tick (Ixodes scapularis) and the American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis)."], [1973, "HER2-Positive Breast Cancer", "If your breast cancer is \"HER2-positive,\" it's more aggressive than other types of breast tumors, but treatments can help. About 1 of every 5 of breast cancers are HER2-positive. That means the cancer cells have more of a protein called HER2, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. You'll work with your doctor to review the treatment options and come up with a plan that's best for you. Doctors don't know the exact causes of breast cancer. Experts think it may be a combination of things, including your genes, environment, and lifestyle. You can't inherit a bad copy of the HER2 gene from a parent, and you won't pass it on to your children. The most common warning sign of any type of breast cancer is a lump in your breast that feels different from the area around it. Other symptoms may include: Breast swelling A change in its shape Skin irritation or dimpling Pain in the breast or nipple Redness or thickness of the nipple or breast skin Discharge from the nipple (not breast milk) You may have noticed a difference in your breasts during a self-exam. Or you may have had a mammogram that showed a growth. When you find out that you have breast cancer, your doctor will check to see if yours is HER2-positive. She'll probably give you one or more of these tests: The IHC test uses certain antibodies that identify the HER2 protein in a sample of breast cancer tissue. If there is a lot of it, the cells change color in the sample. These tests see if there are too many HER2 genes in the cancer cells: The FISH test uses fluorescent pieces of DNA that stick to the HER2 gene in cells, which can then be counted under a microscope. The SPOT-Light HER2 CISH and the Inform HER2 Dual ISH tests use stains that color HER2 genes in a tissue sample, so that they can be counted under a microscope. Sometimes the results of a single test aren't clear. If that happens, your doctor may order another type. Because your breast cancer is HER2-positive, that makes a difference in how your doctor will treat it. This type of the disease doesn't respond well to the hormone treatments that work for other forms of breast cancer. That stops or blocks the protein from helping cancer cells grow. Having breast cancer can be overwhelming. Remember, though: You're in control of your treatment decisions and how you live your life. These tips can help you stay healthy while you get treatment: Get the support you need, whether it's information about breast cancer, talking with someone, or practical help with daily tasks. It can all make a huge difference in how you feel. Breast cancer of any kind is easier to treat when it's diagnosed early. If your disease spreads or has comes back, there are still ways to treat it. Talk with your doctor about whether a clinical trial is a good option for you. The American Cancer Society is a good starting place to find the support you and your family may need throughout your treatment and afterward. You may want to join a support group. That's a good way to meet people who know what you're going through, because they've been through it, too. That could help you handle the emotions that can come with having cancer."], [1974, "Hermansky Pudlak Syndrome (HPS)", "Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome is a rare, hereditary disorder that consists of three characteristics: lack of skin pigmentation (albinism), blood platelet dysfunction with prolonged bleeding, and visual impairment."], [1975, "Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy IV (HSN IV, HSAN IV)", "Summary Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IV (HSAN4 or HSAN IV) is a rare genetic disorder that usually begins in infancy and is characterized by an inability to feel pain and an inability to sweat (anhidrosis). The sensory loss in individuals with HSAN IV is due to abnormal functioning of the sensory nerves that control responses to pain and temperature. An inability to feel pain can lead to unintentional self-mutation, repeated fractures, and joint damage. Introduction The hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN), also known as the hereditary sensory neuropathies, include at least six similar, but distinct inherited degenerative disorders of the nervous system (neurodegenerative) that frequently progress to loss of feeling, especially in the hands and feet. Some types of HSAN are related to or identical with some forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and others are related to or identical with familial dysautonomia (Riley-Day syndrome). The classification of the HSANs is complicated, and the experts to not always agree on it. Furthermore, HSANs are classified more broadly as peripheral neuropathies or disorders or the peripheral nervous system, which encompasses all of the nerves outside of the central nervous system (i.e. HSAN IV is also known as congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA)."], [1976, "HIV Symptoms and Stages of HIV", "Without treatment, it will get worse over time and eventually overwhelm your immune system. Most people don't know right away when they've been infected with HIV, but a short time later, they may have symptoms. This is when your body's immune system puts up a fight, typically within 2 to 6 weeks after you've gotten the virus. They include: Headache Diarrhea Nausea and vomiting Fatigue Aching muscles Sore throat Swollen lymph nodes A red rash that doesn't itch, usually on your torso Fever Doctors can now prevent HIV from taking hold in your body if they act quickly. People who may have been infected -- for example, had unprotected sex with someone who is HIV-positive -- can take anti-HIV drugs to protect themselves. But you must start the process within 72 hours of when you were exposed, and the medicines can have unpleasant side effects. After your immune system loses the battle with HIV, the flu-like symptoms will go away. You may not realize you're infected and can pass HIV on to others. Fortunately, a combination, or \"cocktail,\" of medications can help fight HIV, rebuild your immune system, and prevent spreading the virus. if you're taking medications and have healthy habits, your HIV infection may not progress further. You can also be diagnosed with AIDS if you have an \"AIDS defining illness\" such as Kaposi's sarcoma (a form of skin cancer) or pneumocystis pneumonia (a lung disease). If you didn't know you were infected with HIV earlier, you may realize it after you have some of these symptoms: Being tired all of the time Swollen lymph nodes in your neck or groin Fever that lasts for more than 10 days Night sweats Unexplained weight loss Purplish spots on your skin that don't go away Shortness of breath Severe, long-lasting diarrhea Yeast infections in your mouth, throat, or vagina Bruises or bleeding you can't explain People with AIDS who don't take medication only survive about 3 years, even less if they get a dangerous infection.

Although you'll always have it, treatment helps you manage it. There have been big improvements in treatment, and researchers continue to look for new solutions. With this disease, a certain protein in your body is not in balance. This causes tiny blood vessels to push fluid into nearby areas of your body. Where you have it, how often the bouts happen, and how strong they are is different for everyone. The attacks can come and go as well as move to different spots during the same bout. So if you know you have HAE and you feel any change like that, call 911 right away. Without treatment, you can have attacks as often as every 1 to 2 weeks, and they can be hard to manage. In most cases, you don't have enough of this protein. For the most common form of HAE, if one of your parents has HAE, you have a 50% change of having it, too. But sometimes the gene change happens for unknown reasons. You won't have the itching or hives that people often get with allergic reactions. It can happen in different parts of the body: Mouth or throat Hands Feet Face Genitals Belly Swelling in the throat is the most dangerous symptom. Puffiness in the feet and hands can be painful and make it hard to go about your daily life. Swelling in your belly can cause: Extreme pain Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea You may notice early warning signs before swelling begins. These may include: Extreme fatigue Muscle aches Tingling Headache Belly pain Hoarseness Mood changes Although you may not be able to tell what your triggers are, common ones include: Stress or anxiety Minor injury or surgery Illnesses such as colds or flu Physical activities such as typing, hammering, or pushing a lawn mower Medications, including some used for high blood pressure and congestive heart failure Women may notice a difference in the number or sharpness of attacks when they: Have their period Are pregnant. For some women, it doesn't happen as often when they're pregnant, but then the attacks come back after they give birth. Women usually say they have more and worse attacks while on these medicines. If you've had symptoms of HAE, your doctor may ask: What changes have you noticed? Have you had any in your face, neck, tongue, or throat? Have you noticed any changes that happen before swelling begins? Sometimes people are treated for allergies when it's really HAE that causes their swelling. You can have severe stomach cramps, and if misdiagnosed, it can lead to surgery you don't need. You'll need blood tests, too, to confirm that it's HAE. If you do have it, ask your doctor to refer you to a specialist familiar with the condition. You should also ask your doctor about having other members of your family tested, even if no one has symptoms. Doctors can use medications to treat attacks: Berinert Cinryze Conestat alfa (Rhucin, Ruconest) Ecallantide (Kalbitor) Icatibant (Firazyr) You may also need oxygen or IV fluids to ease your symptoms. Your doctor will make recommendations for what you need. It helps to track your attacks and symptoms in a journal and look for patterns. He may want you to take medication to avoid a flare. Carry your medical information with you at all times. If your child has HAE, note any changes in behavior that you see before an attack. As he gets older, he'll need to learn his triggers and treatment needs. Make sure all caregivers and family members know about the condition and what to do if an attack happens. Take your medication for attacks, and see a doctor or go to the hospital right away. They can share their insights and tips to help you manage your symptoms. There's no cure for HAE, but new treatments have made it possible for people to manage their symptoms and enjoy active lives.

It's different from \"secondary\" liver cancers, which have spread to the liver from other organs. In more advanced cases it can't be cured, but treatment and support can help you live longer and better. It's important to remember that you still have control over the decisions you make about your treatment and your life. Make sure you have people you can talk to about your plans, your fears, and your feelings. Ask your doctor about support groups, where you can meet people who know what you're going through. Your doctor can help you understand your treatment options. Doctors aren't sure exactly what causes all cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, but they've identified some things that may increase your risk for getting it: Hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Hepatocellular cancer can start many years after you've had one of these liver infections. Many things can cause it: hepatitis B or C infection, alcohol drinking, certain drugs, and too much iron stored in the liver. Having more than two alcoholic drinks a day for many years raises your risk of hepatocellular cancer. Both conditions raise your risk of liver cancer. The higher risk from diabetes may be due to high insulin levels in people with diabetes or from liver damage caused by the disease. You might not have any symptoms when hepatocellular carcinoma is in an early stage. As the cancer grows, you may have one or more of these: Pain in the upper right part of your belly A lump or feeling of heaviness in your upper belly Bloating or swelling in your belly Loss of appetite and feelings of fullness Weight loss Weakness or deep fatigue Nausea and vomiting Yellow skin and eyes Pale, chalky bowel movements and dark urine Fever Your doctor will give you a physical exam and may ask you questions like: Have you had any pain in your belly? Your doctor may use tests to help diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma: Blood test. Your doctor takes a sample of your blood and checks to see if it has a protein called AFP. : Unborn babies have high levels of AFP, but it decreases in most people right after birth. If your blood has a high amount of AFP, it could be a sign of liver cancer. Your doctor may ask you to get an ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI to look for tumors in your liver. Your doctor may want to remove a sample of your liver tissue and check it under a microscope for cancer cells. In one method, your doctor removes some liver tissue with a needle that he places through your skin and into your liver. He numbs the area first so you won't feel pain. Your doctor may also do a biopsy by making a small cut in your belly and putting a needle into the liver to pull out a sample of tissue. It's a big decision, so work closely with your doctor to make the right plan for you. Two types of radiation therapy can treat hepatocellular carcinoma: External: You'll lie on a table while a large machine aims beams of radiation at specific spots on your chest or belly. Internal: A doctor injects tiny radioactive particles into the artery that sends blood to your liver. These block or destroy the blood supply to the tumor in your liver. Radiation therapy can cause side effects, including nausea, vomiting, or tiredness, but these symptoms go away when treatment is done. To treat cancer, doctors often place chemotherapy drugs directly into your liver. Your doctor puts a thin, flexible tube into the artery that supplies blood to your liver. You usually get chemotherapy on an outpatient basis, which means you don't need to stay overnight in a hospital. It can cause side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, fever and chills, headache, and weakness. You may also be more likely to get infections, bruising, bleeding, and fatigue. An ultrasound, which uses sound waves to see structures in your body, helps your doctor guide a thin needle into the tumor. You usually have this procedure under local anesthesia, which means you won't feel pain but you're awake while this is going on. In cryoablation, your doctor destroys your tumor by freezing it with a thin metal probe. While you're under anesthesia, your doctor puts the probe into the tumor and delivers a cold gas that kills the cancer cells. A similar method, called radiofrequency ablation, uses an electric current to kill the cancer with heat. Your surgeon may take out the part of your liver that has the cancer, an operation called \"partial hepatectomy.\" Healing time varies, but you might have pain and discomfort for the first few days. You may also feel weak or tired for a while. Some people also have diarrhea and a sense of fullness in the stomach. If your doctor can't remove your cancer through a partial hepatectomy, he may suggest a liver transplant. Your new liver will come from someone who recently died and has the same blood type and a similar body size as yours. Since you may have to wait a long time for a new liver, your doctor may suggest that you keep up with other treatments in the meantime. You may need to stay in the hospital for up to 3 weeks after your surgery. After your transplant, you'll need to take drugs that prevent your body from rejecting the new liver. If you're considering a transplant, you'll need a lot of emotional support. Ask your doctor about support groups that have people facing the same concerns as you. While you're getting treatment, there are lots of things you can do to manage side effects and stay healthy. Since chemotherapy can sometimes upset your stomach, you can try changing some of your eating habits. You can also try eating five or six small meals a day rather than the traditional three meals. If you're stressed about your treatment, sometimes deep breathing and meditation might help you relax. For others, the cancer may not go away completely or may return. If that's the case, you may need regular treatment to keep it in check for as long as possible. Your treatment to fight liver cancer may stop working. You may not be able to control your cancer, but you control choices about how you'll live your life. Consider joining a support group, where you can you share your feelings with others who understand what it's like.

There are two main types of the condition: A and B. There are 13 of these clotting factors in our blood. With hemophilia B, you don't have enough factor IX. More than half the people with it have a severe case; they have almost no factor IX in their blood. Diagnosis usually comes in early childhood. The two main symptoms are bleeding for longer than normal, and bruising easily. Your child may have: Nosebleeds for no apparent reason Lots of blood loss from small cuts Long-term bleeding in the mouth from biting down, or after a tooth is removed Bleeding from a cut or injury that starts up again after stopping Blood in his pee or stool Large bruises If your child has a muscle or joint that is bleeding, it can hurt, especially when he moves it. Usually it's swollen and hot to the touch. If it happens, get emergency medical help for any of these signs of bleeding in the brain: Headache Neck pain and stiffness Vomiting Sleepiness Sudden weakness or problems walking In the first 6 months of life, babies don't fall or get hurt often, so an early diagnosis is rare. As he begins to crawl, he may get bumps and raised bruises. The doctor may ask: What happened to cause your child's bumps, bruises, or bleeding? Your doctor will also ask about your family's medical history to find out if anyone had a problem with bleeding or blood clotting. To get the diagnosis, doctors will test your child's blood to find out how long it takes to clot and to see if it's missing any clotting factors. It gives important information about the kinds and numbers of cells in your blood. These measure levels of those clotting factors. If your child is diagnosed with hemophilia B, you'll probably have a lot of questions. There is no cure, but you can manage the condition, and your child can enjoy an active life. He can get the factor IX his body doesn't make. The replacement protein can come from human blood, or it's made in a lab. If your child has severe hemophilia, he may need regular treatments to prevent bleeding. If he doesn't, he may need only treatment to stop bleeding after it starts. You can get replacement therapy at a clinic or from a visiting nurse, or you can learn to do it at home. Besides giving any factor replacement that may be needed, quick first aid is important when your child gets hurt. Clean any small cuts, scrapes, and injuries, and immediately apply pressure and a bandage. Working out helps strengthen muscles, which can lessen bleeding from injuries. Extra weight puts more strain on the body, and that can increase problems from bleeding. He may need to take medications to help clot his blood before certain procedures, like dental work. Some over-the-counter medications, like ibuprofen, can cause bleeding, so check with your doctor before you give any to your child. Use safety straps in car seats, strollers, and high chairs. Check your home and yard for possible problems like sharp edges. With the right precautions and planning, your child can keep doing all the things he loves to do. See the doctor regularly, and make sure to follow the treatment plan.

That means your body has problems stopping bleeding, both outside and inside your body. The good news is that it can be treated, and in some cases you can give yourself the treatment at home. You can lead a full life when you have the right treatment plan in place. With hemophilia A, your body doesn't have enough of a protein called factor VIII, which your body needs to make clots and stop bleeding. Hemophilia A can be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on how little you have of factor VIII. It's usually diagnosed in babies, toddlers, or young children. Or it can happen if a certain gene changes before you're born. There is a rare, dangerous form of hemophilia A that is not inherited. It's called acquired hemophilia A and it can be related to pregnancy, cancer, or the use of certain medications. However, no cause can be found in about half of cases. The main symptoms you might notice are bleeding more than normal and bruising easily. For instance: Nosebleeds for no apparent reason Heavy bleeding from small injuries Heavy long-term bleeding in the mouth after a tooth is removed Bleeding from a cut or injury that starts up again after stopping Blood in urine or stool Large bruises If you have bleeding in a muscle or joint, it may be painful to move it. You may have swelling, and the area may feel hot to the touch. Bleeding can also happen in the brain. If you have a head bump -- even if it's minor -- and you have any of the following symptoms, call your doctor: A headache Neck pain and stiffness Throwing up Sleepiness Sudden weakness or problems walking Does your child bruise easily, or bleed for longer than normal from small injuries? It's unusual for a baby younger than 6 months old to be diagnosed with hemophilia. Once a baby starts moving, crawling, and bumping into things, you may notice raised bruises, especially on places like the stomach, chest, back, and bottom. What happened to cause the bumps, bruises, and bleeding? The doctor may also do blood tests, including: Complete blood count (CBC) Prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT). Both of these tests check how long it takes blood to clot. Factor IX is for hemophilia B, another type of hemophilia. If you or your child is diagnosed with hemophilia, you'll probably have a lot of questions for your doctor, including: How often will you need to visit the doctor? How long is too long to bleed from a small cut? The goal of treatment is to give you the factor VIII your body doesn't make. It's not a cure, but it does help control your hemophilia. When you have hemophilia A, you get a concentrated version of factor VIII. Factor VIII can come from human blood or from a lab. The drug Adynovate has been found to help control bleeding in adults and children 12 and older. A form of clotting factor VIII derived from pigs (called Obizur) is approved to stop bleeding episodes in people with acquired hemophilia A. You can have these treatments at a clinic, by visiting a nurse, or you can even learn to do it yourself at home. If you have severe hemophilia A, you may need regular treatments to avoid any bleeding. If your case is milder, you may get it as \"demand therapy\" to stop bleeding right when it starts. Replacement therapy works in most cases, but there's a 20% chance your body will reject it. In that case, your doctors may try different sources for factor VIII, or try different amounts. Antifibrinolytic medicines such as tranexamic acid and epsilon aminocaproic acid are oral medicines that are sometimes used with replacement therapy to help keep blood clots from breaking down. You can do a lot to help manage your hemophilia day to day. Clean small cuts, scrapes, and injuries. If your hemophilia is mild, your doctor may suggest you use a product called desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) to stop the bleeding from minor cuts. It can be given intravenously, through an injection, or in the form of nasal spray. Tell all your health care providers that you (or your child) has hemophilia. You may need to take medications to help clot your blood beforehand. If your child has hemophilia A, he can still be active. Check your home and yard for hazards, like furniture or play equipment with sharp corners. Although there's no cure for the condition, with the right precautions and planning people with hemophilia A can live healthy, full lives. Stay active, but learn to recognize the symptoms. Many other people have hemophilia, and their advice can be helpful and inspiring, especially if you're just starting to get familiar with the condition. The National Hemophilia Foundation can connect you to a treatment center near you and to support groups. The federal government pays for a network of more than 100 hemophilia treatment centers where you can get treatment, education, and other resources you need."], [1982, "Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS)", "The hemolytic uremic syndrome is defined by the sudden occurrence of acute hemolytic anemia with fragmented red blood cells, low levels of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia), and acute kidney injury. Hemolytic uremic syndrome is a general term that covers three main subtypes STEC (typical), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, and Sp HUS (Streptococcal pneumonia associated HUS). This report covers STEC (typical) hemolytic uremic syndrome, which is most often associated with E. coli infection and bloody diarrhea. NORD has a separate report on the rarer atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, which is not caused by infection with E. coli and is often the result of a genetic mutation. Typical hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is an uncommon disease that occurs in 5 to 15 percent of individuals, especially children, who are infected by the Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacterium, usually O157:H7. The onset of HUS is preceded by an illness characterized by vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, and, usually, bloody diarrhea."], [1983, "Helping Your ADHD Child Succeed In School", "Working with teachers and other school personnel. Use the Internet to locate national organizations, ask your doctor, or visit your local library or bookstore for information about ADHD. Know your child's symptoms and treatment plan. Talk with your doctor about your child's behaviors that may interfere with learning and about ways to control those behaviors. Develop a record of your child's treatment plan(What is a PDF document?). Laws exist ensuring education rights for children who have conditions that interfere with learning. Contact your state and local education departments for information about ADHD in the schools and your rights to educational accommodations. Talk with other parents of children with ADHD. Join a support group for ADHD families. Find out how others have effectively worked with school systems. Before a school year begins, get to know the principal and other appropriate school personnel. Find out as much as you can about the school policies and rules, especially how behavior problems are handled. Find out if there are other children with ADHD in the school and how their behavior is being handled in the classroom. Look for ways to help them get that information, such as suggesting books, pamphlets, or any local educational programs. Before the school year begins, talk with your child's teacher about his or her style of teaching and discipline in the classroom. Share with the teacher information about your child's symptoms and what behaviors may interfere with his or her ability to learn. You may want to share your child's treatment plan with the teacher. Make a school plan (What is a PDF document?) Work with the teacher to design a plan to help your child perform to his or her potential. You may need to work with the school to develop an individual education plan (IEP) for your child. An IEP is a tool for classroom and homework adaptations for a child with a disability. For children with milder symptoms, the school may suggest a plan that is used for medical conditions that do not meet the IEP standards (called a 504 plan). Ask school personnel for help when needed. Tutoring or services that help with study or organizational skills are sometimes provided through the school. If not, school personnel often have a list of local resources that can help your child. Most children with ADHD can be taught in a regular classroom, although adjustments are sometimes needed. Also, teachers are stretched to their limits by large numbers of children in the classroom, making it difficult to give each child personal attention. Share with the teacher any relevant changes in your child's treatment plan. If possible, volunteer for school activities and parties. Children with ADHD often lose or forget their assignments. Meet with the teacher at the end of the school year to discuss your child's overall progress and the teacher's suggestions for the next year. Ask him or her about possible teachers for the next year and how to help your child get the best chance for success in school. Talk with your child about how the teacher will let him or her know that a behavior is becoming inappropriate. Use the same signals (such as hand signals) that the teacher uses at school to indicate when a behavior is becoming inappropriate. Also, you can reward your child with privileges for remembering to bring home school progress reports. Even young children can learn to use lists, daily planners, or calendars to keep up with homework assignments, tests, and activities. Use learning aids, such as tape recorders or computers. Collect copies of any records that are used to evaluate your child for ADHD. These records often identify the type of ADHD that your child has, which helps with treatment. Record all medicines(What is a PDF document?) that your child has taken or is taking to treat ADHD. Keep copies of any school plans, daily school progress reports, and formal progress reports throughout the year. You may find them helpful as you develop school plans for the following year. If your school developed an individual education plan (IEP) for your child, ask for a copy. You may need to share that information with the health professionals working with your child."], [1984, "Hearing Loss", "The earlier you get a diagnosis and treatment, the more you can stay involved in the world around you. If you lose hearing, either suddenly or over time, details of conversations may become fuzzy. Depending on the cause of your hearing loss, you may also have: Pain in one or both ears Dizziness or vertigo Ringing in the ears, called tinnitus Pressure or fullness in one or both ears Often, people with severe hearing loss withdraw from their social lives because they're embarrassed to ask family and friends to repeat themselves over and over again. It can show the degree of your hearing loss by looking at the range of decibels -- a measure of loudness -- you can hear. Normal hearing is in the range of 0 to 20 decibels. Moderately severe hearing loss ranges from 56 to 70 decibels. Severe hearing loss is in the range of 71 to 90 decibels. People with severe to profound hearing loss will have trouble hearing speech, although they can make out loud sounds like a truck that backfires or an airplane taking off. There are three main types of hearing loss: Conductive hearing loss happens because of a problem in the ear canal, eardrum, or the middle ear that prevents sound from carrying well to the inner ear. An ear infection, trauma, a tumor, or fluid or an object in the ear (such as wax buildup) can cause it. Sensorineural hearing loss happens most often from damage to the hair cells in the inner ear. Other causes include damage to the nerve for hearing, called the auditory nerve, or the brain. It's usually happens as you get older, but it also can happen because of noise exposure, chemotherapy, radiation, trauma, and your genes. There may be a problem in the outer or middle ear and in the inner ear or auditory nerve. It can happen after a head injury, long-term infection, or because of a disorder that runs in your family. If you notice sudden hearing loss, you should see an ear, nose, and throat specialist as soon as possible. When your hearing is normal, sound waves enter your outer ear and cause your eardrum and middle ear bones to vibrate. Hearing loss happens when there's a problem with the parts of the ear that you use to hear. Any of these conditions can lead to severe hearing loss: Age. As people get older, some parts in the ear become less elastic. The blare of power tools, airplanes, or loud music on headphones, for example, can damage the hair cells in the cochlea. How much hearing you lose depends on the volume of the sound and how long you were around it. Usually, the hearing loss from an ear infection is mild and goes away shortly. But if you don't treat the infections, they can lead to serious long-term problems. An ear infection, loud sounds, trauma, or intense pressure in the ear from flying in an airplane or scuba diving can damage the eardrum, leaving a hole that may or may not heal. Depending on the size of the hole, there may be mild or moderate hearing loss. This is a collection of skin that you can get in the middle ear when the eardrum collapses or when skin grows through a hole in the eardrum. Cholesteatomas grow over time and can lead to hearing loss by destroying the middle ear bones or, rarely, the inner ear. Measles, mumps, syphilis, and meningitis are just a few of the conditions that can cause hearing loss. Symptoms of this inner ear disorder include: Dizziness Hearing loss that comes and goes Ringing in the ear Fullness in the ear Hearing loss in Meniere's disease usually gets worse but only involves one ear. Cancer or benign tumors can cause severe hearing loss. People who have one might also have numbness in their face or weakness and ringing in their ear. When something's in your ear that shouldn't be, it can block hearing. Injuries like a skull fracture or a punctured eardrum can cause severe hearing loss. Some types of drugs -- including some antibiotics, large amounts of aspirin, chemotherapy drugs (carboplatin, cisplatin), and Vicodin (in large amounts) -- can cause hearing loss. Scientists have found genes that make people more prone to severe hearing loss, particularly as they age. Most of the time, newborn screening tests find genetic hearing loss, but it can show up later. It's one of the main features of several autoimmune disorders, including Cogan's syndrome, Wegener's granulomatosis, and Behcet's disease."], [1985, "Health and Safety, Ages 2 to 5 Years", "It does not cover every risk that a child faces, but it does cover many of the most common hazards and situations that can be dangerous to children ages 2 to 5 years. Children in this age range are gaining many new skills, and they feel more and more independent. They may be curious, want to explore the world around them, and act without thinking. At this age, children see everything that happens as it relates to themselves. And they believe that what they wish for or expect to happen can affect what really happens. You can help decrease any dangers by accepting that your child will go through active and curious phases. Think about what you can do to avoid safety hazards. If your child is discovering the joys of riding a tricycle, for example, be sure to make riding in the street off-limits. Remember that no one can watch a child's every move or make a home 100% safe all the time. Try to find a balance for supervising your child, taking safety precautions, and allowing your child to explore. Doing so can help you learn how to respond to and make a positive impact on how your child behaves. Your child is gaining in confidence and probably wants to explore. But your child still needs your close supervision and guidance. You can: Set up and consistently enforce rules and limits to help your child learn about dangers. For example, teach your child to always use the car seat and that ovens and toasters can cause burns. For example, wash your hands often, keep toys clean, make sure your child is immunized, and go to all well-child visits. For example, store poisonous products out of your child's reach, and use safety covers on all electrical outlets. Most injuries to children happen when parents or caregivers are tired, hungry, or emotionally drained or are having relationship problems. Other common causes of family stress include changes in daily routines, moving to a new house, or expecting another child."], [1986, "Headaches, Tension-type", "Tension headaches are dull pain, tightness, or pressure around your forehead or the back of your head and neck. Often called stress headaches, they're the most common type for adults. The episodic kind usually start gradually, often in the middle of the day. The pain may get stronger or ease up throughout the day, but it's almost always there. Although your head hurts, tension headaches usually don't keep you from your daily activities, and they don't affect your vision, balance, or strength. Up to 80% of adults in the U.S. get them from time to time. Most of the time, they're triggered by stress, whether from work, school, family, friends, or other relationships. Episodic ones are usually set off by a single stressful situation or a build-up of stress. This muscle tension can come from: Not enough rest Bad posture Emotional or mental stress, including depression Anxiety Fatigue Hunger Low iron levels For others, tightened muscles aren't part of tension headaches, and there's no clear cause. A few common ones are: Mild to moderate pain or pressure in the front, top, or sides of the head Headache that starts later in the day Trouble sleeping Feeling very tired Irritability Trouble focusing Mild sensitivity to light or noise Muscle aches Unlike migraine headaches, you won't have other nerve symptoms, such as muscle weakness or blurred vision. And they don't usually cause severe sensitivity to light or noise, stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting. It's best to treat tension headaches when they first begin and the symptoms are still mild. The goal is to prevent more of them from happening and to relieve any pain you're already in. For prevention, you can: Take medications Avoid the causes or triggers Manage your stress or learn relaxation techniques Practice biofeedback Try home remedies, like a hot bath, ice packs, or better posture Over-the-counter (OTC) painkillers are often the first treatments doctors recommend for tension headaches. If OTC pain relievers don't help, your doctor may recommend a prescription-strength med or a muscle relaxant. You take them every day even if you aren't in pain, so that you end up using less medication over time. Keep in mind that medications don't cure headaches and that, over time, pain-relievers and other drugs may not help as much as they did at first.

Porphyrias can also be classified into two groups: the \"hepatic\" and \"erythropoietic\" types. Porphyrins and related substances originate in excess amounts from the liver in the hepatic types, and mostly from the bone marrow in the erythropoietic types.

It sends out chemicals like histamine to fight off the foreign substance. You get congested, and your nose and eyes may itch and water. Usually your doctor can diagnose allergies based on your symptoms and triggers. If your reactions are more severe or medication doesn't help, an allergist (a doctor who specializes in treating allergies) may do a skin test to find out what your triggers are. She'll put tiny bits of things that might cause an allergic reaction (she'll call them allergens) on your arm or back, and then scratch the surface of your skin. Any places that get red and itchy mean you have an allergy to that specific trigger. It's rare, but your doctor may also do a blood test to help diagnose you. Your doctor may call them \"hay fever.\" If you have asthma or eczema, you're more likely to get hay fever or year-round allergies. Here's how it works: She'll put a little bit of the allergy trigger into your body. Over time you get used to the substance and don't react to it anymore. Shots work best if you have symptoms for longer than 3 months each year. They can help lower your need for meds to control your symptoms.

Patients with tuberculoid leprosy have limited disease and relatively few bacteria in the skin and nerves, while lepromatous patients have widespread disease and large numbers of bacteria. Tuberculoid leprosy is characterized by a few flat or slightly raised skin lesions of various sizes that are typically pale or slightly red, dry, hairless, and numb to touch (anesthetic). Lepromatous leprosy is at the other end of the spectrum, with a much more generalized disease, diffuse involvement of the skin, thickening of many peripheral nerves, and at times involvement of other organs, such as eyes, nose, testicles, and bone. The intermediate subtypes are borderline tuberculoid, midborderline, and borderline lepromatous leprosy. Borderline leprosy and the subtypes are characterized by more extensive disease than polar tuberculoid, with more numerous skin lesions and more nerve involvement, but not as widespread disease as in lepromatous leprosy.

Heartburn symptoms can start up because of a problem with a muscular valve called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Normally, with the help of gravity, the LES keeps stomach acid right where it should be -- in your stomach. When it's working right, the LES opens to allow food into your stomach or to let you belch, then closes again. But if the LES opens too often or doesn't close tightly enough, stomach acid can seep into the esophagus and cause a burning sensation. If your LES doesn't tighten as it should, there are often two things that contribute to the problem. Another is too much pressure on your stomach, often due to obesity, pregnancy, or constipation. Certain foods can relax your LES or increase stomach acid, including: Tomatoes Citrus fruits Garlic and onions Chocolate Coffee or caffeinated products Alcohol Peppermint Meals high in fats and oils (animal or vegetable) often lead to heartburn, as do certain medications. Stress and lack of sleep can raise how much acid your stomach makes and can cause heartburn. If you're pregnant, the hormone progesterone can relax your LES and lead to heartburn. Smoking also relaxes the LES and increases stomach acid. But long-term heartburn, known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), can sometimes lead to serious problems, such as: Long-term cough Laryngitis Inflammation or ulcers of the esophagus Problems swallowing because of a narrow esophagus Barrett's esophagus, a condition that can make it more likely to get esophageal cancer"], [1997, "Hand-Washing", "Hand-washing is a simple and effective way to help prevent diseases, such as colds, flu, and food poisoning.

Pay special attention to your wrists, the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your fingernails. You may want to leave the water running while you dry your hands on a paper towel. Then use the paper towel as a barrier between the faucet and your clean hands when you turn off the water. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer or alcohol-based hand wipe that contains at least 60% ethyl alcohol or isopropanol.

Call him right away if you have: Unexplained weight gain -- 2 pounds in a day or 5 pounds in a week Swelling in your ankles, feet, legs, or belly that gets worse Shortness of breath that gets worse or happens more often, especially if you wake up feeling that way Bloating with a loss of appetite or nausea Extreme fatigue or more trouble finishing your daily activities A lung infection or a cough that gets worse Fast heart rate (above 100 beats per minute, or a rate noted by your doctor) New irregular heartbeat Chest pain or discomfort during activity that gets better if you rest Trouble breathing during regular activities or at rest Changes in how you sleep,like having a hard time sleeping or feeling the need to sleep a lot more than usual Less of a need to pee Restlessness, confusion Constant dizziness or light-headedness Nausea or poor appetite Go to your local emergency room or call 911 if you have: New, unexplained, and severe chest pain that comes with shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, or weakness Fast heart rate (more than 120-150 beats per minute, or a rate noted by your doctor) -- especially if you are short of breath Shortness of breath that doesn't get better if you rest Sudden weakness, or you can't move your arms or legs Sudden, severe headache Fainting spells"], [2000, "Heart Failure Living With Heart Failure", "By making lifestyle changes, you can take an active role in treating your heart failure while maintaining a productive life. This article addresses many lifestyle questions you may have and offers tips that should make performing daily activities easier. You can resume your regular activities as soon as you feel better, but follow your doctor's guidelines. Increase your activities slowly, and always listen to your body so you know when it's time to take a rest break. Exercise in a cardiac rehabilitation facility can help strengthen your heart and increase your stamina. The earlier you start, the more help the program will be in helping you understand your stamina. If you have been in the hospital for your heart failure, your doctor will tell you how soon you can return to work after you go home. Your return to work will be based on your overall health, symptoms, and your rate of recovery. If you have a job that requires a lot of physical work, you may need to change some of your job-related activities. Your doctor can help you decide if your job will affect your heart condition and if you need to make changes. You may need to plan at least one rest period every day. When you rest, keep your feet up to keep the swelling in your legs down. Using less energy with daily tasks can help you have more energy to do more activities during the day. You may need to cut down on some of your activities or use energy-saving devices or techniques. If daily self care or home care activities are too tiring, tell your doctor. Do the things that take more energy when you are feeling your best. If you become tired during an activity, stop and rest. You may need to finish it on another day or when you feel less tired. Also, do not plan activities right after a meal. Be careful not to nap too much during the day or you might not be able to sleep at night. If needed, use devices and tools that assist you, such as a walker, shower chair, hand-held shower head, bedside toilet, or long-handled tools for dressing (such as a shoe horn). Wear clothes that have zippers and buttons in the front so you don't have to reach behind you. Do all of your grooming (shaving, drying your hair, etc.) If your doctor says it's OK, you may climb steps. You may need to rest part of the way if you become tired. Do not push, pull, or lift heavy objects (more than 10 pounds). For more energy-saving tips, tell your doctor you would like to speak to an occupational therapist or cardiac rehabilitation specialist. Sometimes, cardiac rehabilitation can help increase your energy levels and help you get your strength back. You may travel as soon as you are feeling better, but always let your doctor know when you plan to go and provide a phone number where you can be reached. By following these traveling tips, your vacation will be more enjoyable: Always take all of your medications with you and make sure you have enough medications to last throughout your trip. If you are traveling by plane, carry your medications with you. You may need a letter from your doctor that verifies all of your medications, especially if you are traveling internationally. In areas where the water might be unsafe, drink bottled water or other beverages (order beverages without ice). Your diagnosis of heart failure, your symptoms, and your concern for the future may cause you and your loved ones to feel depressed or worried. As you begin taking charge of your health and making positive changes, you may find these feelings start to fade. However, if negative feelings continue and interfere with your ability to enjoy life, talk to your doctor. Here are some tips to help you deal with emotional blues: Get dressed every day.

Keep up with a healthy routine, including things like: Eat lots of fruits, veggies, and lean protein Limit salt, sugar, and saturated fat Drop pounds if you're overweight Get regular exercise Take the medicines you've been prescribed to lower your blood pressure and cut the workload on your heart Don't stop your medicine or change the dose unless you get the OK from your doctor. Bring down your numbers with diet, exercise, weight loss, and blood pressure medicines if you need them. To avoid heart problems, eat a heart-healthy diet, get more active, and take medicine to lower your blood sugar if your doctor tells you to. Many conditions that damage the heart can lead to heart failure or make it worse. So work closely with your doctor to manage problems like: Abnormal heart valves Heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy) Inflammation of the heart (myocarditis) Heart defects Abnormal heart rhythm such as atrial fibrillation Drugs you take for other conditions can sometimes harm your heart. For instance, some medicines make your body hold on to more salt, which raises blood pressure. Others damage your heart muscle, or interact with drugs you take to control your heart failure. Drugs that can be a problem if you have heart failure include some, but not all treatments for: Asthma Cancer Colds and allergies Depression Diabetes Erectile dysfunction Heart arrhythmia High blood pressure Migraine headaches medicines Pain Seizures Some herbal supplements can worsen heart failure, too. These include: Black cohosh Danshen Ginseng Green tea Hawthorn St. John's wort Go over all the medicines you take with the doctor who treats your heart failure. Although a glass of red wine might protect your heart, once you have heart failure, it could make your symptoms worse. In general, you don't want to drink more than 1 or 2 glasses of alcohol every day. If you already have heart failure, check with your doctor to see if it's safe for you to drink at all. Smoking makes more plaque build up in your arteries, which limits blood flow and makes your heart work harder."], [2003, "Heart Failure Diet & Heart Failure", "Eating a healthy diet may reduce your symptoms of heart failure. A registered dietitian can provide in-depth, personalized nutrition info and help you start an action plan. Here are some basic tips to get you started: Control the salt in your diet. Use the information on food packages to help you to make the best low-sodium selections. This will help make sure you get all the nutrients you need. Include high-fiber foods in your diet. Fiber helps move food along your digestive tract, controls blood sugar levels, and may reduce the level of cholesterol in your blood. Vegetables, beans, whole-grain foods, bran, and fresh fruit are high in fiber. You should have 25 to 35 grams of fiber each day. It can affect your heart rate and worsen your heart failure. Your doctor may tell you to avoid or limit alcoholic beverages. Alcohol may also interact with the medications you are taking.

Your doctor may suggest you start with medication and lifestyle changes. If your condition gets worse, you can turn to centers that specialize in treating heart failure for more options, like surgery. It's important to keep up with your medications and take them the way your doctor tells you to. Common types of drugs that treat heart failure are: Aldosterone antagonist ACE inhibitors ARBs (angiotensin II receptor blockers) ARNIs (angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors) Beta-blockers Blood vessel dilators Calcium channel blockers (unless you have systolic heart failure) Digoxin Diuretics Heart pump medication Potassium or magnesium Selective sinus node inhibitors The goal of surgery is to make your heart work better. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). When your heartbeat is off-kilter, it can make heart failure worse. This treatment uses a pacemaker that sends timed electrical impulses to both of your heart's lower chambers (the left and right ventricles) so they pump better and more in sync. This is done when heart failure is so severe that it doesn't respond to any other treatments. Heart valve surgery. If a faulty heart valve causes your heart failure, your doctor may recommend repairing or replacing it. A surgeon can repair or replace the valves. This device is similar to a pacemaker. Wires lead through your veins and into your heart to keep track of your heart rhythm. If your heart starts to beat at a dangerous rhythm, or if it stops, the ICD tries to pace your heart or shock it back into normal rhythm. Infarct exclusion surgery (modified Dor or Dor procedure). When a heart attack happens in the left ventricle (the lower left chamber of your heart), a scar forms. The doctor puts it into the abdomen or chest and attaches it to your heart to help it pump blood to the rest of your body. VADs are most often used in the heart's left ventricle, but they can also be used in the right ventricle or in both ventricles. He'll make sure you're staying healthy and that your heart failure isn't getting worse. He'll ask to review your weight record and list of medications. Call your doctor if you have urgent concerns. Tell all the doctors you see about your heart failure, the medications you take, and any restrictions you have. Also, tell your heart doctor about any new drugs prescribed by another doctor. Control your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and diabetes. Limit the salt you eat to less than 1,500 milligrams each day. If you need to drop some weight, reduce the number of calories you eat. A regular program that's OK'd by your doctor will improve your symptoms and strength and make you feel better. It may also slow your heart failure. Even if you have no symptoms, the drugs help your heart pump better. Ask your doctor to point you in the right direction. It takes a team to manage heart failure, and you are the key player.

When you have advanced heart failure, you may need an artificial pump put into your chest or even a heart transplant. Your doctor may describe your heart failure based on the strength of your heart and how your body is responding. Compensated heart failure means your heart works well enough that you either don't notice any problems or the symptoms are easy to manage. You don't have fluid buildup in your legs and feet, and you can breathe without trouble. Your body still seems to be doing OK, even with the change in your heart's pumping ability. Decompensated heart failure describes obvious symptoms that affect your overall health and quality of life; for example, congestion in your lungs that makes it harder to breathe, so you wheeze or cough. Decompensated heart failure can also make you feel tired and could make it harder to exercise or even do simple things like folding laundry. One problem with this is that, over time, an enlarged heart leads to fluid building up in your body, including the lungs. Because blood isn't moving well out of the heart, it backs up coming in. Tachycardia can lead to several complications, including blood clots in the heart and fainting. The downside of all this is that your heart can't keep it up, so after a while, it just won't be able to pump blood throughout your body anymore. Early on, your blood vessels get narrower, which raises your blood pressure to make up for the loss of power. Your heart has to work harder, and heart failure gets worse. Because your body can make up for the early stages of heart failure, you may not know you have a problem that needs attention. Regular physicals and doctor checkups can help you catch heart failure as it's developing, so you and your doctor can work together to try to prevent or hold off some of the problems it can cause. Heart failure is a chronic disease, meaning it's a long-term health challenge. Medications and devices such as artificial pumps can help you manage symptoms and keep up your quality of life."], [2006, "Heart Failure Diagnosis", "To check if you have heart failure, your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and may order some tests as well. Once he figures out what's going on, the two of you will work together to get the right treatment. First, your doctor will want to know if you: Have other conditions such as diabetes, kidney disease, angina, high blood pressure, or other heart problems Smoke Drink alcohol, and how much Take medications, and which ones Your doctor will also do a physical exam. He'll look for signs of heart failure as well asother illnesses that may have weakened your heart. The doctor may suggest you get some tests to find the cause of your heart failure and see how severe it is. They look at your kidney and thyroid gland health and measure your cholesterol levels. They also check if you have anemia, which happens when you don't have enough healthy red blood cells. These tests can be used to help figure out if a patient's shortness of breath is caused by heart failure. It also lets your doctor know if there's a buildup of fluid around your heart and lungs. During this exam, your doctor places a wand on the surface of your chest. Your doctor may combine an echocardiogram with tests called Doppler ultrasound and color Doppler to check blood flow across your heart's valves. It's a measure of how much blood is pumped out of your heart each time it beats. A normal amount is between 55% and 75%, which means that over half of the blood volume is pumped out of the heart with each beat. They're attached to a monitor that charts your heart's electrical activity on graph paper. This test can tell your heart rhythm and give a general roadmap of your heart's ability to pump blood. This measures whether you have clogged heart arteries (called coronary artery disease). Your doctor may also call it coronary angiogram. This less-commonly used test helps your doctor figure out if you have problems with your heart muscle or the tissues that surround the heart. It uses an X-ray and a contrast dye to see if you have coronary artery disease. Your doctor can view images in 3-D, which lets him see blockages in your arteries. In this test, your doctor puts a small, flexible biopsy cord into a vein in your neck or groin, and takes a small piece of your heart muscle. Your heart gets \"stressed\" when you walk on a treadmill or take medications that increase its pumping. It helps your doctor find clogged heart arteries."], [2007, "Heart Failure Risks & Prevention", "But there are simple steps you can take to lower your odds of getting the condition. You get heart failure when your heart can't pump enough blood and oxygen to your muscles and organs. Doctors haven't found a cure, but many people with heart failure live active lives. Heart failure usually doesn't sneak up on people, but develops over time and for a number of reasons. Some of these are: High blood pressure Diabetes Coronary artery disease Past heart attack Being too overweight Things like drinking too much alcohol, smoking, and using illegal drugs are all known to damage your heart. Some things that raise your chances of heart failure are out of your control, including: Race (African-Americans are more likely to have heart failure) Heart defects you're born with Age (your odds go up if you're 65 or older) You can lower your odds of getting heart failure. You can begin with a few of these simple steps: Stick to a healthy weight Exercise regularly Eat fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins Limit bad fats, added sugars, salt, and alcohol Don't smoke or use recreational drugs Reduce your stress Get enough sleep If you think you could be likely to have heart failure, talk to your doctor."], [2008, "Heart Failure Types & Stages", "When you have heart failure, it doesn't mean your ticker stopped beating. The chambers of your heart may respond by stretching to carry more blood to pump through your body. This helps keep blood moving for a while, but in time, your heart muscle walls may get weaker. Your kidneys react by causing your body to hold on to water and salt. Fluid may start to build up in your arms, legs, ankles, feet, lungs, or other organs. Heart failure can be brought on by many conditions that damage the heart, including: Coronary artery disease. This is a disease of the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to your heart. If the arteries narrow or get blocked, your heart becomes starved for oxygen and nutrients and can't pump as well. This may happen when a coronary artery is blocked suddenly, which stops the flow of blood to your heart muscle. This is damage to your heart muscle that can be caused by artery or blood flow problems, infections, and alcohol and drug abuse. These include things like high blood pressure, heart valve disease, thyroid disease, kidney disease, diabetes, or heart defects you've had since you were born. This lowers the amount of blood that can enter your heart and raises blood pressure in your lungs. When that happens, you get fluid in your lungs, legs, and belly. The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology have put out a list of heart failure stages that helps you understand how the condition changes over time and the kinds of treatments that are used in each phase. You may be in this stage if you have: High blood pressure Diabetes Coronary artery disease Metabolic syndrome You may also be at risk if you have a history of: Cardiotoxic drug therapy Alcohol abuse Rheumatic fever Family members with cardiomyopathy If you're in stage A, your doctor may suggest lifestyle changes and treatment such as: Regular exercise If you smoke, quit. Take an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) if you've had coronary artery disease or if you have diabetes, high blood pressure, or other heart and blood vessel conditions. Take beta-blockers if you have high blood pressure or you've had a heart attack. You're in this phase if you never had symptoms of heart failure but you're diagnosed with systolic left ventricular dysfunction, which means the left chamber of your heart doesn't pump well. You may be in this group if you had or have: Heart attack Valve disease Cardiomyopathy Treatments for Stage B. Depending on your situation, your doctor may suggest treatments such as: ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) Beta-blockers after a heart attack Aldosterone inhibitor if the symptoms continue while you are taking beta-blockers and ACE/ARB medications Surgery for coronary artery repair and valve repair or replacement Implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) Stage C. You're in this phase if you have systolic heart failure along with symptoms such as: Shortness of breath Fatigue Less ability to exercise Treatments for Stage C. Your doctor may suggest treatments like these, depending on your specific condition: ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers Hydralazine/nitrate combination for some people if symptoms persist Diuretics (water pills) and digoxin if you continue to have symptoms Aldosterone inhibitor when your symptoms stay severe with other treatments Angiotensin receptor blocker and neprilysin inhibitors Biventricular pacemaker Implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) Your doctor may also tell you to these steps: Eat less salt. Stage D. You're in this phase if you have systolic heart failure and advanced symptoms after you get medical care. Treatments for Stage D.

A healthy weight, active lifestyle, and proper medication are all key ways to take charge of the disease. But even you've been carefully following doctor's orders, it's crucial to keep an eye out for the return of symptoms. Keep up with your regular checkups, and know which symptoms may mean your treatment needs to be tweaked. When your heart can't properly fill and empty, blood backs up in your veins. This constant search for air can leave you tired and anxious. When your heart doesn't pump right, the body starts to move blood from less vital parts like your arms and legs to the centers for survival -- the heart and brain. Fluid can build up in your tissues just like it does in your lungs. As a result, your feet, ankles, legs, or belly may swell. Because blood is being moved away from your digestive system, your appetite may not be as big as it usually is. When your heart struggles to pump the right amount of blood, it may speed up to make up for it. This can lead to palpitations, which could cause your heart to race or feel like it's fluttering or throbbing. Unusual amounts of things like sodium in your blood can bring disorientation, confusion, or memory loss. With the right care, you can keep things under control."], [2010, "Heart Failure Symptoms", "If you have heart failure, you may not have any symptoms, or the symptoms may range from mild to severe. Heart failure symptoms are related to the changes that occur to your heart and body, and the severity depends on how weak your heart is. A weak heart causes fluid to back up in the lungs. A weak heart pumps less blood to your kidneys and causes fluid and water retention, resulting in swollen ankles, legs, and abdomen (called edema) and weight gain. This can also cause an increased need to urinate during the night as your body attempts to get rid of this excess fluid. Bloating in your stomach may cause a loss of appetite or nausea. Less blood to your major organs and muscles makes you feel tired and weak. Less blood to the brain can cause dizziness or confusion. The heart beats faster to pump enough blood to the body. In addition, your symptoms may not be related to how weak your heart is; you may have many symptoms but your heart function may be only mildly weakened. Your doctor may ask you to keep a record of the amount of fluids you drink or eat and how often you go to the bathroom. Remember, the more fluid you carry in your blood vessels, the harder your heart must work to pump excess fluid through your body. Limiting your fluid intake to less than two liters per day will help decrease the workload of your heart and prevent symptoms from recurring. Monitor your weight and lose weight if needed. Your goal is to keep your weight within four pounds of your dry weight. If you gain 2 pounds in one day or 5 pounds in one week, call your doctor. Your doctor may want to adjust your medications. Call your doctor if new symptoms occur or if your symptoms worsen. Drugs are used to improve your heart's ability to pump blood, decrease stress on your heart, decrease the progression of heart failure, and prevent fluid retention. These drugs will cause your blood vessels to dilate or relax (thereby lowering your blood pressure)."], [2011, "Heart Failure Causes", "Heart failure can happen when your heart is too weak to pump enough blood to the rest of your body. Some health conditions can affect how well your heart works and lead to heart failure. CAD happens when a fatty substance called plaque builds up in your arteries (the blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood from your heart to the rest of your body). Your heart has to pump harder to push blood through those narrow arteries, and it doesn't get the blood it needs to work as well as it should. Over time, this can make your heart so weak that it leads to heart failure. If the clot gets lodged in one of the arteries bringing blood to your heart, it can block the blood flow and you could have a heart attack. Without enough oxygen, the part of the heart that's blocked can die. This damage weakens your heart and can lead to heart failure. Blood pressure is the force of blood as your heart pumps it through your arteries. This makes your heart work harder to push blood through your body, and that extra work makes your heart bigger and weaker. High blood pressure that's not managed well can double or triple your chances of heart failure. The hormone insulin normally moves sugar from your bloodstream into your cells, where it's used for energy or stored for later. When you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use insulin well enough. This can leave too much sugar in your blood (high blood sugar). It may be linked to atrial fibrillation (a quivering or irregular heartbeat) and high blood pressure in your lungs, which can lead to heart failure. Being obese also makes you more likely to have diseases linked to heart failure, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or sleep apnea. This disease damages your heart muscle and makes it so weak it can't pump blood like it should. The problem can start when you're born, or it can be caused by something that damages your heart, like a heart attack or an infection. When a valve doesn't open or shut the way it should, your heart has to work harder to pump blood. A valve problem that isn't treated can lead to heart failure. One or two drinks a day might be good for your heart, but more than that can lead to obesity, high blood pressure, and heart failure. Drugs like cocaine, amphetamines, and ecstasy (MDMA) ramp up your heart rate and raise your blood pressure. Using these drugs can lead to a heart attack and eventually make your heart fail. Smoking also damages your heart and raises your blood pressure. Smoking also narrows your blood vessels and makes your blood more likely to clot. Several drugs can lead to heart failure or make it worse, including: Antidepressants -- citalopram (Celexa) and tricyclic antidepressants Antifungal drugs -- amphotericin B (Ambisome, Amphotec) and itraconazole (Sporanox, Onmel) Drugs that affect your appetite Asthma medicines -- albuterol (Proventil, Ventolin), bosentan, and epoprostenol Blood pressure medicines -- alpha-blockers and calcium channel blockers Chemotherapy drugs used to treat cancer Diabetes drugs -- metformin (Glucophage, Glumetza) Epilepsy drugs -- carbamazepine (Tegretol) and pregabalin (Lyrica) Heart rhythm drugs Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain relievers (NSAIDs) Migraine medicines -- ergotamine and methysergide Medication used to treat Parkinson's disease"], [2012, "Heart Failure What Is Heart Failure?", "The term \"heart failure\" might make you think your heart is about to stop working. A healthy heart pumps blood throughout the body to make sure it gets all the blood and oxygen it needs. Over time, if you have heart failure, the heart can't give the body everything it needs. Your heart might try to make up for it by enlarging, getting more muscle, or pumping faster. Blood vessels may get narrower, and your body may even stop sending blood to your less important organs and tissues. Heart failure can involve just one side of the heart or both sides. It's usually broken down into several types: Left-sided heart failure: The left ventricle is larger and pumps more of the heart's blood. This type of heart failure is broken down into two categories: Systolic failure, where the left ventricle is too weak to push enough blood Diastolic failure, where the left ventricle is too stiff, can't relax, and can't fill with blood normally Right-sided heart failure: This usually happens after the left side fails. More fluid pressure through the lungs damages the right side of your heart. Congestive heart failure: When blood slows down as it leaves the heart, it also is slower when it comes back. That causes blood to back up in your veins, and there can be swelling all over your body. You might see it in your legs and ankles, but it can collect in your lungs, too.

Electrocardiogram (EKG): This records the electrical activity of your heart. Chest X-ray: It will let your doctor know if you have an enlarged heart. Echocardiogram: This uses sound waves to make a video image of your heart. Then a device called a gamma camera takes pictures of your heart to show how well it's working. However, if you're pregnant or nursing, you shouldn't have this test. Methods include: Lifestyle changes: Your doctor will probably suggest that you: Follow a heart-healthy diet Exercise regularly Aim for a healthy weight Quit smoking Medication: You may need to take one or more drugs as part of your treatment. Common heart failure medications include: ACE inhibitors Diuretics Beta-blockers Digoxin Surgery and devices: In some cases, you may need surgery. If your condition is more severe, your doctor may implant a device like a defibrillator or something called a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in your body."], [2013, "Hammertoes", "A hammertoe occurs from a muscle and ligament imbalance around the toe joint which causes the middle joint of the toe to bend and become stuck in this position. The most common complaint with hammertoes is rubbing and irritation on the top of the bent toe. Toes that may curl rather than buckle -- most commonly the baby toe -- are also considered hammertoes. The middle three toes are likeliest to be affected. Women are more likely to get pain associated with hammertoes than men because of shoe gear. Hammertoes can be a serious problem in people with diabetes or poor circulation because they have a higher risk for infections and foot ulcers. People with these conditions should see a doctor at the first sign of foot trouble. If the toe still can be moved at the joint, it's a flexible hammertoe. If the tendons in the toe become rigid, they press the joint out of alignment. At this stage, the toe can't be moved. When the toe muscles get out of balance, a hammertoe can form. Muscle imbalance puts a lot of pressure on the toe's tendons and joints.

Less often, affected individuals have mild scarring within the lungs and little to no change in the disease for many years. Although there is no cure for IPF, various different treatments are available to manage the disorder and several newer therapeutic options are being studied. Introduction IPF is classified as a form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, which is a group of lung diseases that damage the lungs in a similar manner and occur due to unknown causes.

The plasma cell type of Castleman's disease may be associated with fever, weight loss, skin rash, early destruction of red blood cells, leading to unusually low levels of circulating red blood cells (hemolytic anemia), and/or abnormally increased amounts of certain immune factors in the blood (hypergammaglobulinemia). Unicentric Castleman's disease affects lymph nodes in only one part of the body, while multicentric Castleman's disease affects multiple parts of the body.

With good health habits, you can protect yourself and your children from H. pylori. But when scientists discovered H. pylori in 1982, they found that the germs were the cause of most stomach ulcers. After H. pylori enters your body, it attacks the lining of your stomach, which usually protects you from the acid your body uses to digest food. Once the bacteria have done enough damage, acid can get through the lining, which leads to ulcers. These may bleed, cause infections, or keep food from moving through your digestive tract. You can get H. pylori from food, water, or utensils. It's more common in countries or communities that lack clean water or good sewage systems. You can also pick up the bacteria through contact with the saliva or other body fluids of infected people. Many people get H. pylori during childhood, but adults can get it, too. The germs live in the body for years before symptoms start, but most people who have it will never get ulcers. It may come and go, but you'll probably feel it most when your stomach is empty, such as between meals or in the middle of the night. You may feel better after you eat, drink milk, or take an antacid. Other signs of an ulcer include: Bloating Burping Not feeling hungry Nausea Vomiting Weight loss for no clear reason Ulcers can bleed into your stomach or intestines, which can be dangerous to your health. Get medical help right away if you have any of these symptoms: Stool that is bloody, dark red, or black Trouble breathing Dizziness or fainting Feeling very tired for no reason Pale skin color Vomit that has blood or looks like coffee grounds Severe, sharp stomach pain It's not common, but H. pylori infection can cause stomach cancer. Over time, you may notice: Belly pain or swelling Nausea Not feeling hungry Feeling full after you eat just a small amount Vomiting Weight loss for no reason If you don't have symptoms of an ulcer, your doctor probably won't test you for H. pylori. Medicines like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can also damage your stomach lining, so it's important to find out what's causing your symptoms so you can get the right treatment. To start, your doctor will ask you about your medical history, your symptoms, and any medicines you take. Then she'll give you a physical exam, including pressing on your belly to check for swelling, tenderness, or pain. You may also have: Tests of your blood and stool, which can help find an infection Urea breath test. If you have H. pylori, the bacteria will change the urea in your body into carbon dioxide, and lab tests will show that your breath has higher than normal levels of the gas. You may be asleep or awake during the procedure, but you'll get medicine to make you more comfortable. It's a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures of the inside of your body. If you have H. pylori, your doctor may also test you for stomach cancer. This includes: Physical exam Blood tests to check for anemia, when your body doesn't have enough red blood cells. Fecal occult blood test, which checks your stool for blood that's not visible to the naked eye Endoscopy Biopsy, when a doctor takes a small piece of tissue from your stomach to look for signs of cancer. Tests that make detailed pictures of the insides of your body, such as a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) If you have ulcers caused by H. pylori, you'll need treatment to kill the germs, heal your stomach lining, and keep the sores from coming back. Bismuth subsalicylate, which may also help kill H. pylori along with your antibiotics Medicines that block the chemical histamine, which prompts your stomach to make more acid. Your treatment could mean you'll take 14 or more pills per day for a few weeks, which seems like a lot of medicine. If you don't take antibiotics the right way, bacteria in your body can become resistant to them, which makes infections harder to treat. About 1-2 weeks after you finish your treatment, your doctor may test your breath or stool again to make sure the infection is gone. You can protect yourself from getting an H. pylori infection with the same steps you take to keep other germs at bay: Wash your hands after you use the bathroom and before you prepare or eat food. Though stress, spicy foods, alcohol, and smoking don't cause ulcers, they can keep them from healing quickly or make your pain worse. Talk to your doctor about ways to manage your stress, improve your diet, and, if you smoke, how you can get help to quit. Most ulcers caused by H. pylori will heal after a few weeks of treatment. If you've had one, you should avoid taking NSAIDs for pain, since these drugs can damage your stomach lining.

[1,2] Five-year survival is about 55% when the tumors are localized and resected but only about 15% when the tumors are not resectable. Cancer of the Pancreas: Relative Survival Rates (%) by Histologic Subtype, Ages 20+, 12 SEER Areas, 1988-2001. Key, C. Ch 7: Cancer of the pancreas. SEER Survival Monograph: Cancer Survival Among Adults: U.S. SEER Program, 1988-2001, Patient and Tumor Characteristics. Pathogenesis Tumors of the endocrine pancreas are a collection of tumor cell types collectively referred to as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Although they may be similar or identical in histologic appearance to carcinoid tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, differences in their underlying biology and likely differences in response to therapeutic agents suggest that they should be treated and investigated as a distinct entity. [3] Most pancreatic NETs are sporadic, but some occur as part of the autosomal dominant multiple endocrine neoplasia type-1 (MEN-1) inherited syndrome consisting of tumors of the anterior pituitary, parathyroid, and endocrine pancreas glands, which results from the inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene Menin located on chromosome 11q13. [4] When part of the MEN-1 syndrome, there may be multiple pancreatic tumors. Islet tumors may either be functional (produce one or more active hormones) or nonfunctional. [4] The functional tumors, which usually present with symptoms of hormone hypersecretion, include: Gastrinoma. Prognostic Factors Most islet cell cancers are functional, but about 15% are nonfunctional, with presentations similar to the far more common exocrine adenocarcinomas of the pancreas. [5,6,7] Because of the presence of several cell types in the pancreatic islets (alpha, beta, delta, A, B, C, D, E, F), the term, islet cell tumors, refers to at least five distinct cancers that, when functional, produce unique metabolic and clinical characteristics. The clinical manifestations in functional tumors may result from the distinctive metabolic effects of the polypeptide(s) secreted by the cancer cells rather than from tumor bulk or metastatic disease. [4] Although nonfunctional tumors do not produce specific clinical syndromes, they may secrete inactive amine and peptide products such as the following: Neurotensin. Alpha-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (alpha-hCG). Chromogranin A. Diagnostics The frequent long delays between initial symptoms and diagnosis and the varied effects of the polypeptides secreted often necessitate involvement of multiple surgical and medical subspecialties. [4] Effective palliation may be achieved because of the slow-growing nature of the majority of these tumors and the potential use of antihormonal pharmacologic therapy (e.g., cimetidine in the ulcer-producing Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). In patients with indolent, slow-growing metastatic islet cell tumors, the best therapy may be careful observation, and no treatment until palliation is required. In patients with MEN-1 in which 85% have pancreatic islet cell tumors, 90% have hyperparathyroidism, and 65% have pituitary tumors, and they are less likely to be cured by pancreatic resection than are patients with sporadic islet cell tumors. With the exception of pain relief from bone metastases, radiation therapy has a limited role in this disease. Tumor localization and staging studies include imaging with computed tomography (CT) with or without magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and endoscopic ultrasound. However, somatostatin-receptor scintigraphy has diminished utility in localizing insulinomas versus other pancreatic NETs, since insulinomas often have a low density of somatostatin receptors. [4] If the noninvasive tests do not reveal a tumor, but clinical suspicion remains high, more invasive and technically demanding tests, such as selective arteriography or selective arterial stimulation (with a secretagogue specific for the suspected tumor type), may be useful. [7] Some of the tumor types have unique characteristics that require specific approaches in their diagnosis and initial evaluation. Provocative testing with calcium and secretin shows considerable overlap, and the value of these tests is limited. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is a syndrome of unrelenting peptic ulcer disease, diarrhea, and gastric hyperacidity, associated with a gastrin-producing tumor. (Refer to the Diarrhea section in the PDQ summary on Gastrointestinal Complications for more information.) About 15% to 35% of gastrinomas are associated with the MEN-1 syndrome and up to 50% are malignant. [4] Diagnostic tests: BAO:MAO &gt;= = 0.6 (Basal Acid Output:Maximal Acid Output). Serum gastrin 10 times normal or &gt;500 pg/mL (the accuracy of gastrin assays may vary widely). About 5% to 8% are associated with MEN-1 syndrome. [4] The clinical manifestations are those of hypoglycemia, which results from inappropriate secretion of insulin by the tumor. Fasting hypoglycemia (&lt;40 mg/dL) associated with an elevated insulin level (in the absence of exogenous administration of insulin) is pathognomonic. These tumors are usually slow-growing tumors and, when localized to the pancreas or regional lymph nodes, can be cured with pancreatic resection. The approach to management depends on carefully performed preoperative localization studies and the findings at exploratory laparotomy. In a retrospective case series of 30 patients with 32 pancreatic insulinomas, the combination of preoperative dual-phase thin-section multidetector CT and endoscopic sonography correctly identified and localized all of the tumors. [8] These tests, with or without MRI, have replaced older, more invasive, and technically challenging tests, such as percutaneous transhepatic portal venous sampling and arterial stimulation with venous sampling except for unusual circumstances in which the imaging tests are unsuccessful. [4,9] Glucagonoma Glucagonoma is the third most common endocrine-secreting islet cell tumor. [4] Necrolytic migratory erythema, hyperglycemia, and venous thrombosis comprise a virtually diagnostic triad. These tumors tend to be large and easily visible on CT scan. Miscellaneous islet cell tumors These tumors are rare but have defined clinical syndromes associated with specific production of polypeptide hormone production by islet cell tumors. Because of their rarity and similar approaches to management, they are grouped in the section on treatment. Miscellaneous tumors include the following: VIPoma (Verner-Morrison Syndrome) is characterized by watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria.A serum vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) greater than 200 pg/mL is diagnostic. [4] These tumors can generally be easily localized by CT scan. Decreased pancreatic secretion of enzymes and bicarbonate accounts for the diarrhea and steatorrhea. CT scan, MRI, and endoscopic ultrasound can usually help localize and stage the tumor. : SEER Survival Monograph: Cancer Survival Among Adults: U. S.

Painful blisters similar to cold sores can show up on the inside of your child's mouth or on his tongue. He might get a rash on the palms of his hands or the soles of his feet a day or two after the first symptoms appear. Mouth sores can make it hurt to swallow, so be sure your child gets enough water and calories. Your doctor will ask about your child's symptoms and look at any sores or rashes.

Without blood, the bone tissue dies and causes the bone to collapse. If the process involves the bones near a joint, it often leads to collapse of the joint surface. Although it can happen in any bone, osteonecrosis most commonly affects the ends (epiphysis) of long bones such as the femur, the bone extending from the knee joint to the hip joint. The amount of disability that results from osteonecrosis depends on what part of the bone is affected, how large an area is involved, and how effectively the bone rebuilds itself. In the course of osteonecrosis, however, the healing process is usually ineffective and the bone tissues break down faster than the body can repair them.

Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia. Iron deficiency anemia is caused by low levels of iron in the body. You might have low iron levels because you: Have heavy menstrual bleeding. This bleeding may be caused by problems such as ulcers, hemorrhoids, or cancer. Bleeding inside the body is the most common cause of iron deficiency anemia in men and in women after menopause. This problem may occur if you have celiac disease or if you have had part of your stomach or small intestine removed. You may not notice the symptoms of anemia, because it develops slowly and the symptoms may be mild. In fact, you may not notice them until your anemia gets worse. As anemia gets worse, you may: Feel weak and tire out more easily. If you think you have anemia, see your doctor. Your doctor will do a physical exam and ask you questions about your medical history and your symptoms. These tests may include a complete blood count to look at your red blood cells and an iron test that shows how much iron is in your blood. Your doctor may also do tests to find out what is causing your anemia. Your doctor will probably have you take iron supplement pills and eat foods rich in iron to treat your anemia. Most people begin to feel better after a few days of taking iron pills. But do not stop taking the pills even if you feel better. You will need to keep taking the pills for several months to build up the iron in your body. If your doctor finds an exact cause of your anemia, such as a bleeding ulcer, your doctor will also treat that problem. Do not take iron pills on your own without seeing your doctor first. If you take iron pills without talking with your doctor first, the pills may cause you to have too much iron in your blood, or even iron poisoning. Your low iron level may be caused by a serious problem, such as a bleeding ulcer or colon cancer. You can get the most benefit from iron pills if you take them with vitamin C or drink orange juice. Do not take your iron pills with milk, caffeine, foods with high fiber, or antacids. If you are pregnant, you can prevent anemia by taking prenatal vitamins.

And you will need to keep the area clean, change the dressing according to your doctor's instructions, and watch for signs of infection. To reduce the risk of infection: Ask your doctor how long you need to keep the area dry. Look at the incision every day, checking for signs of infection (see below). Take a bath unless you can keep the incision dry. Instead, take showers or sponge baths until your doctor says it's okay to take baths. Before you shower, cover the dressing with a plastic bag or use another method of keeping it dry. You may notice some soreness, tenderness, tingling, numbness, and itching around the incision. There may also be mild oozing and bruising, and a small lump may form. Call your doctor if you notice signs of an infection, such as: A yellow or green discharge that is increasing. Before you start, make sure you have gauze pads, a box of medical gloves, surgical tape, a plastic bag, and scissors. Then: Prepare supplies by opening the gauze packages and cutting new tape strips. Clean the incision if your doctor told you to do so. Inspect the incision for signs of infection. Hold a clean, sterile gauze pad by the corner and place over the incision. Tape all four sides of the gauze pad. Do not use rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or iodine, which can harm the tissue and slow wound healing. Air-dry the incision or pat it dry with a clean, fresh towel before reapplying the dressing. Stitches or staples normally cause some redness and swelling where the stitch enters the skin, along with mild irritation and itching.

The generator houses the battery and a tiny computer. If needed, energy is delivered to the ventricle to restore a normal heart rhythm. Energy can be delivered to the right atrium and then to the right ventricle, helping your heart to be paced in a normal sequence. Leads are attached in the right atrium, the right ventricle and the coronary sinus, adjacent to the left ventricle.

When the heart is beating dangerously fast, a high-energy shock is delivered to the heart muscle to restore a normal rhythm. When the heart beats too slow, small electrical impulses stimulate the heart muscle to maintain a suitable heart rate. Before you have your ICD implanted, ask your doctor what medications you are allowed to take. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking certain medications before the procedure. If you have diabetes, ask your doctor how you should adjust your diabetes medications. If you must take medications, drink only with a sip of water. When you have an ICD implanted, you will start by lying on a bed and the nurse will place an intravenous line (IV) into your arm or hand. You will be given an antibiotic to prevent infection and a medication through your IV to relax you and make you drowsy, but it may not put you to sleep. The monitors allow the doctor and nurse to check your heart rhythm, blood pressure, oxygen level of your blood, and other measurements during the procedure. The left or right side of your chest, from your neck to your groin will be shaved and cleansed with a special soap. Sterile drapes are used to cover you from your neck to your feet. A soft strap will be placed across your waist and arms to prevent your hands from coming in to contact with the sterile field. The ICD may be implanted in two ways, but the endocardial (transvenous) approach is most common. The generator is placed under skin in your upper chest and attached to the lead(s). On rare occasion, it may be necessary for your doctor to implant your ICD using the epicardial approach (outside your heart). Instead of placing the lead through a vein and guiding it to the heart, it is sewn onto the heart. Minimally invasive approaches, such as robotic-assisted surgery, are available to lessen the trauma associated with this type of surgery. You will normally be admitted to the hospital overnight after your ICD is implanted. The morning after your implant, you will have a chest X-ray to make sure the ICD leads are in the proper position and your ICD will be programmed to ensure it is functioning properly. You will receive information about the type of ICD and leads you have, the date of implantation, and the name of the doctor who performed the procedure. In about three months after the procedure, you will receive a permanent identification card with this information. It is important that you carry this card with you at all times in case you need medical attention. For the first six weeks after the procedure, avoid lifting, pushing, or pulling objects that weigh more than 10 pounds. If you had open-heart surgery, it may take longer for you to get back to some activities. Your doctor or nurse will discuss specific activity guidelines with you before you leave the hospital. Most electrical devices, such as microwave ovens, do not interfere with ICD function. You need to avoid strong electric or magnetic fields, such as some industrial equipment, MRI machines, high-output ham radios, high-intensity radio waves (found near large electrical generators, power plants, or radio frequency transmission towers), and arc or resistance welders. Stay at arm's length from less powerful electric or magnetic fields, such as large magnets, stereo speakers, airport security wands, and antennas used in ham or CB radios. If you are in stronger electrical or magnetic fields, the ICD may stop monitoring your heart rhythm. Once you are out of these fields, normal ICD function should resume. If you must pass through entrances where theft devices are being used, walk quickly through them. Do not undergo any tests that require magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). You may or may not be aware of when your ICD detects and corrects your heart rhythm. You may or may not feel the impulses -- usually they are not detectable. Some patients describe the sensation as feeling like a shock from an electrical outlet. Most times, you will be awake when the shock is delivered, but on occasion, you may lose consciousness before the therapy is delivered. If you do not feel well after the shock, call your doctor or an ambulance (dial 911 in most areas). If you feel fine after the shock, you do not need to seek immediate medical attention. If someone is touching you when the ICD fires, they may feel a tingling sensation; this is not harmful to them. Call your doctor about your ICD if: You receive 2 or more shocks in a 48-hour period. You have swelling, bleeding, redness, warmth, or drainage at the implant site. You have numbness or tingling of the arm closest to your ICD. You have a fever or chills within 6 weeks to 8 weeks after the implant procedure. Your doctor will tell you how often you will need to have the ICD checked. During ICD checks, the doctor will determine if the ICD has detected or treated any abnormal heart rhythms and will check the ICD battery. A defibrillator lasts three years to six years, depending on how often it delivers a shock. When you need your ICD changed, you will be admitted to the hospital for the procedure. If the function of the leads is acceptable, they will be attached to a new generator."], [2042, "Impetigo", "If your child gets red sores, especially around the nose and mouth, he could have impetigo. It's a skin infection caused by a bacteria, and it spreads easily. Impetigo sores can appear anywhere on the body, but children tend to get them on their face. They start as tiny blisters that break and reveal moist, red skin. In serious cases, the infection invades a deeper layer of skin and turns into a form of impetigo called ecthyma. When that happens, your child gets pus-filled bumps with a crust that's much darker and thicker than ordinary impetigo. If your child scratches the irritated area, it can cause the infection to spread quickly. The most common way for your child to get impetigo is when he has contact with someone who has the infection, such as playing contact sports like wrestling. It's especially easy to pick it up if your kid has an open wound or a fresh scratch. You can also catch impetigo if you share the same clothes, bedding, towels, or other objects with someone with the infection.

The disorder is classified as an autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), an uncommon group of disorders in which the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy red blood cells. However, in recent years, PCH has become recognized as one of the most common causes of acute AIHA in young children. The reason why acute transient PCH appears to be a more common type of childhood AIHA than it was thought to be several decades ago is uncertain, but probably relates to greater awareness of the disorder and more frequent use of the Donath-Landsteiner test (see Diagnosis section ), especially in children with acute AIHA with hemoglobinuria. With the effective treatment of syphilis and the virtual elimination of the congenital form, \"classical\" syphilitic PCH is now an extremely rare disorder, as is chronic PCH. It was in patients with the chronic form of PCH that exposure to cold resulted in a paroxysm of hemoglobinuria. In modern times, PCH is almost always encountered as an acute transient syndrome in young children with a recent history of a viral illness, so that paroxysms resulting from cold exposure are rarely encountered. Thus, although this type of AIHA is known as PCH, the words paroxysmal and cold are generally not relevant to the disorder as it is manifest in the modern era. As children with PCH do not usually have hemolysis directly related to exposure to the cold (e.g., they continue hemolysis when in a warm hospital environment), it has been suggested that a better term might be Donath-Landsteiner test positive hemolytic anemia."], [2046, "IHIS", "Hyper-IgM Syndrome may be characterized by recurrent pus-producing (pyogenic) bacterial infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract including the sinuses (sinusitis) and/or the lungs (pneumonitis or pneumonia); the middle ear (otitis media); the membrane that lines the eyelids and the white portions (sclera) of the eyes (conjunctivitis); the skin (pyoderma); and/or, in some cases, other areas. Individuals with Hyper-IgM Syndrome are also susceptible to \"opportunistic\" infections, i.e., infections caused by microorganisms that usually do not cause disease in individuals with fully functioning immune systems (non-immunocompromised) or widespread (systemic) overwhelming disease by microorganisms that typically cause only localized, mild infections. In individuals with Hyper-IgM Syndrome, such opportunistic infections may include those caused by Pneumocystis carinii, a microorganism that causes a form of pneumonia, or Cryptosporidium, a single-celled parasite (protozoa) that can cause infections of the intestinal tract. In addition, individuals with Hyper-IgM Syndrome are prone to certain autoimmune disorders affecting particular elements of the blood, such as neutropenia, a condition in which there is an abnormal decrease of certain white blood cells (neutrophils). Additional physical findings often associated with the disorder may include enlargement (hypertrophy) of the tonsils, enlargement of the liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), chronic diarrhea and impaired absorption of nutrients by the intestinal tract (malabsorption), and/or other symptoms. Because approximately 70 percent of reported cases of Hyper-IgM Syndrome are inherited as an X-linked recessive genetic trait, the vast majority of affected individuals are male."], [2047, "Inherited Lipodystrophy", "Lipodystrophy is a problem with the way your body uses and stores fat. It makes you lose the fat under your skin, so it can change the way you look. You can't cure it, but with your doctor's help, the right treatment, a low-fat diet, and plenty of exercise, it's something you can live with. Because fat tissue makes the hormone leptin, people with inherited lipodystrophy often don't have enough of this chemical. Leptin tells your body you've eaten enough and to make insulin. The condition can also make fat build up in places it shouldn't, like the blood, heart, kidneys, liver, and pancreas. Inherited lipodystrophy is actually a group of related illnesses. The most common are: Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL), also called Berardinelli-Seip syndrome Familial partial lipodystrophy (FPL) Researchers have found several genes that cause inherited lipodystrophy. It's also possible to have a bad gene but not get the disease. The two main kinds of inherited lipodystrophy have several subtypes. Their skin may be dark, thick, and velvety in places, especially at the neck, armpits, and where their legs meet the trunk of their body. Adults with CGL have large hands and feet and a strong, square jawbone because their hormone balance is off and they keep growing. They could have larger than usual sex organs (clitoris, or penis and testicles). It's easier to recognize FPL in women, since men tend to look muscular even without the disease. They can also have problems with their periods and may get PCOS. These women are more likely to have serious complications including: Diabetes High triglyceride and low HDL (the \"good\" cholesterol) levels Heart disease Your doctor might ask you these questions: What symptoms have you noticed? Are changes in how your child looks only in certain areas, or all over? Have you had his blood sugar, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels checked? Does anyone else in the family have problems with body fat? Since lipodystrophy is passed on by genes, your family history is very important. After talking to you and doing a full exam, the doctor may want to do some tests to learn more about what type of lipodystrophy your child has. Blood tests check: Blood sugar Kidney health Fats Liver enzymes Uric acid Checking your child's blood for leptin won't diagnose lipodystrophy, but it can help your doctor decide how to treat it. X-rays use radiation in low doses to make images of structures inside his body. These can show bone problems that some people with lipodystrophy have. For a skin biopsy, the doctor will take a small piece of skin and check the cells under a microscope. Genetic testing may find the specific problem genes to pinpoint what type of lipodystrophy he has. Your doctor may also look for a pattern of fat loss with: Skinfold thickness measurements, checking how much skin he can pinch between his fingers at specific spots on the body A special X-ray that measures bone mineral density A special whole-body MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures showing tissues with fat What subtype of lipodystrophy is this? How many people with this disease have you treated? What's the best way for us to manage this condition? Is there anything I can do that will help my child look and feel \"normal\"? Can we be part of a lipodystrophy research study? Is it important to let other family members know he has this disease? Since you can't replace the missing body fat, your aim will be to avoid complications of the disease. People with CGL may be able to get shots of metreleptin (Myalept) to replace the missing leptin and help prevent other diseases. Women shouldn't use birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy for menopause because they can make levels of fats worse. Your doctor may prescribe a lotion or cream to lighten and soften dark skin patches. As your child with CGL gets older, he may be able to get plastic surgery for his face with skin grafts from his thighs, belly, or scalp. Doctors can also use implants and injections of fillers to help reshape facial features. People with FPL who have extra fat deposits can have liposuction to get rid of some areas, but fat may build up again. Talk to your doctor about what approach for his appearance makes sense and when. Because this condition affects how someone looks, care and compassion are as important as medicine. Focus on keeping your child healthy and giving her a meaningful, rewarding life. People may not know how to react or what to say to keep from prying or offending or embarrassing you. Try to focus your praise on achievements, rather than appearance. But kids will be kids, so prepare her for unkind looks and words. Help her practice how she can respond with role-play and humor. Someone with training can help your child and your family sort out their feelings as they deal with the challenges of this disease. How long and how well someone with inherited lipodystrophy lives depends on how well they can manage the complications. Someone with FPL has a 50/50 chance of passing the faulty gene to their child. Work closely with your doctor to help prevent the most serious complications for your child's subtype. Researchers are studying this disease, and they may find more treatment options. Living with a condition like this can feel very isolating. Lipodystrophy United has information about the disease as well as an online community for people with lipodystrophy and their families. You can also add your information to a free, confidential registry to help researchers find new treatments."], [2048, "Infertility Understanding Infertility -- Symptoms", "Infertility is when you cannot get pregnant after having unprotected, regular sex for six months to one year, depending on your age. The main symptom of infertility is not getting pregnant. You may not have or notice any other symptoms. Many health conditions can make it hard to get pregnant. In women, changes in the menstrual cycle and ovulation may be a symptom of a disease related to infertility. The number of days in between each period varies each month. Back pain, pelvic pain, and cramping may happen. In this case, symptoms can also include: Skin changes, including more acne Changes in sex drive and desire Dark hair growth on the lips, chest, and chin Loss of hair or thinning hair Weight gain Other symptoms of disorders that may lead to infertility include: Milky white discharge from nipples unrelated to breastfeeding Pain during sex Many other things can lead to infertility in women, and their symptoms vary. Infertility symptoms in men can be vague. Symptoms depend on what is causing the infertility. They can include: Changes in hair growth Changes in sexual desire Pain, lump, or swelling in the testicles Problems with erections and ejaculation Small, firm testicles If you are under 35 and have been trying to get pregnant without success for a year, see your doctor. Women 35 and older should see their doctor after six months of trying. Blood, urine, and imaging tests can be done to discover why you are having trouble getting pregnant.

It usually follows a viral infection of the upper respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts."], [2050, "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis", "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) causes scar tissue to grow inside your lungs. Usually, when you breathe in, oxygen moves through tiny air sacs into your bloodstream. IPF scar tissue is thick, like the scars you get on your skin after a cut. It slows oxygen flow from your lungs to your blood, which can keep your body from working as it should. Low oxygen levels and the stiff scar tissue make it hard to breathe. For most people, symptoms don't get better, but there are new treatments that can slow the damage to your lungs. Some people will get worse quickly, while others can live 10 years or more after they are diagnosed. There are therapies to help you breathe easier and manage your symptoms. In some cases, you may be able to have a lung transplant. Some people get pulmonary fibrosis when they're exposed to something in their environment, like pollution, certain medicines, or an infection. But most of the time, doctors don't know what causes IPF. You might be more likely to get IPF if you: Smoke cigarettes Breathe in wood or metal dust at work or home Have acid reflux disease Sometimes, IPF runs in families. You can have IPF for a long time without noticing any symptoms. After many years, the scarring in your lungs gets worse, and you might have: A dry, hacking cough that doesn't go away Shortness of breath, especially when you walk or do other activities You might also notice that: You feel more tired than usual Your joints and muscles ache You've lost weight without trying The tips of your fingers and toes have gotten wider, called clubbing IPF is hard to tell apart from other lung diseases because it shares many of the same signs. It may take time and a lot of visits to the doctor to get the right diagnosis. If you have trouble breathing that doesn't get better, you'll probably need to see a pulmonologist, a doctor who treats lung problems. The doctor will use a stethoscope to listen to your lungs. Have you ever been told you had the Epstein-Barr virus, influenza A, hepatitis C, or HIV? Your doctor also will give you one or more of these tests:Continue reading below... You walk on a treadmill or ride a stationary bike while someone checks the levels of oxygen in your blood through a probe on your fingertip or attached to your forehead. This is a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures of your organs. It can help find out how severe your IPF is and possibly the cause. The doctor removes small pieces of your lung tissue and examines them under a microscope. This may be done with surgery or with a flexible tube and small camera that looks down your throat and into your lungs. Treatments for IPF won't cure the disease, but they can make it easier for you to breathe. Some may keep your lungs from getting worse quickly. Scientists are still finding out exactly how they work, but they do know these treatments can slow down scarring and damage in your lungs. You breathe oxygen through a mask or prongs that go in your nose. It boosts the oxygen in your blood so you have less shortness of breath and can be more active. Whether you need to wear oxygen depends on how serious your condition is. Some people with IPF need it only when they sleep or exercise. You work with a team of doctors, nurses, and therapists on ways to manage your symptoms. You might focus on exercise, healthy eating, relaxation, stress relief, and ways to save your energy. Doctors usually recommend it for someone whose illness is very severe or gets worse very fast. Getting a new lung or lungs can help you live longer, but it is major surgery. If you fit the criteria for a lung transplant, your doctor will put you on a waiting list for a lung from a donor. After your transplant, you could be in the hospital for 3 weeks or longer. You'll need to take drugs for the rest of your life that keep your body from rejecting your new lung. You'll also have lots of tests to see how well your lungs are working and regular physical therapy. If you're considering a lung transplant, you'll need emotional support from family and friends. Support groups can help by putting you in touch with people who are also getting or have had transplants. Ask your doctor about programs that can help explain what to expect before and after the surgery. They often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be good for you. IPF is a serious disease, and it will have a big effect on your life and your loved ones. To stay as healthy as possible, follow your treatment plan and see your doctor regularly to make sure your treatment is working. There are other things you can do to feel better: Eat healthy. A well-rounded diet of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat or fat-free dairy, and lean protein is good for your body in general. Eating smaller meals more often will also give your lungs more room to breathe. If it's hard to breathe when you're active, ask your doctor about using oxygen during your workouts. Cigarettes and other tobacco products damage your lungs and make breathing problems worse. Vaccines can protect you from infections like the flu or pneumonia, which can harm your lungs. You will also need to get two vaccines to help protect against a very serious type of pneumonia. Try to stay away from people who have colds. Low-key activities that you enjoy are great ways to fight stress. Remember that it's OK to ask a doctor, counselor, friend, or family member for help with any stress, sadness, or anger you may feel. The scar tissue in your lungs makes it hard for your body to get oxygen, which puts a strain on your other organs. IPF can raise your odds of getting other conditions, including: High blood pressure in the lungs, called pulmonary hypertension Heart attack Stroke Blood clots in your lungs Lung cancer Lung infections Ask your doctor what you can do to lower your chances of having these problems. For some people, the disease gets worse quickly. For others, it can be a slow process where their lungs stay the same for a long time.

There is IBS with constipation (IBS-C) and IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D). While there are several things known to trigger IBS symptoms, experts don't know what causes the condition. Some think that IBS happens when the muscles in the bowels don't squeeze normally, which affects the movement of stool. Another theory suggests it may involve chemicals made by the body, such as serotonin and gastrin, that control nerve signals between the brain and digestive tract. Other researchers are studying to see if certain bacteria in the bowels can lead to the condition Because IBS happens in women much more often than in men, some believe hormones may play a role. Your doctor will see if your symptoms match with the definition of IBS, and he may run tests to rule out conditions such as: Food allergies or intolerances, such as lactose intolerance and poor dietary habits Medications such as high blood pressure drugs, iron, and certain antacids Infection Enzyme deficiencies where the pancreas isn't releasing enough enzymes to properly digest or break down food Inflammatory bowel diseases like ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease Your doctor may do some of the following tests to decide if you have IBS: Flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy to look for signs of blockage or inflammation in your intestines Upper endoscopy if you have heartburn or indigestion X-rays Blood tests to look for anemia (too few red blood cells), thyroid problems, and signs of infection Stool tests for blood or infections Tests for lactose intolerance, gluten allergy, or celiac disease Tests to look for problems with your bowel muscles Nearly all people with IBS can get help, but no single treatment works for everyone. You and your doctor will need to work together to find the right treatment plan to manage your symptoms. Many things can trigger IBS symptoms, including certain foods, medicines, the presence of gas or stool, and emotional stress. Usually, with a few basic changes in diet and activities, IBS will improve over time. Here are some tips to help reduce symptoms: Avoid caffeine (in coffee, teas, and sodas). Add more fiber to your diet with foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and nuts. Keep a record of the foods you eat so you can figure out which foods bring on bouts of IBS. If you're concerned about getting enough calcium, you can try to get it from other foods, like broccoli, spinach, turnip greens, tofu, yogurt, sardines, salmon with bones, calcium-fortified orange juice and breads, or calcium supplements. The following types of drugs are used to treat IBS: Antispasmodics can control colon muscle spasms, but experts are unsure that these drugs help. They also have side effects, such as making you drowsy and constipated, that make them a bad choice for some people. Antidiarrheal drugs, such as Imodium, may help with diarrhea. Bulking agents, such as psyllium, wheat bran, and corn fiber, help slow the movement of food through the digestive system and may also help relieve symptoms. Antidepressants may also help relieve symptoms in some people. Linaclotide (Linzess) is a capsule you take once daily on an empty stomach, at least 30 minutes before your first meal of the day. Lubiprostone (Amitiza) can treat IBS with constipation in women when other treatments have not helped. Make sure to follow your doctor's instructions when taking IBS medications, including laxatives, which can be habit forming if you don't use them carefully."], [2060, "IBM", "In most cases, sIBM is characterized by progressive weakness and degeneration (atrophy) of the muscles especially those of the arms and the legs. The exact cause of the disorder is unknown and the muscle tissue of affected individuals shows both inflammatory and degenerative changes. sIBM is a complex disorder and, most likely, multiple factors including genetic, immunological and environmental ones in combination all play a role in its development."], [2061, "IBS-D", "If you have IBS-D, you have belly pain and other IBS symptoms plus frequent bowel movements. Researchers don't know what causes IBS or IBS-D. We do know that women are more likely to have it than men, and it's more common in adults under 50. It can react to things like stress, bacteria, and even certain foods. The result: Your intestines squeeze too hard, making food move too quickly through your system. If you've had abdominal pain and other signs of IBS for at least 3 months, you may have it. If you have other symptoms, like rectal bleeding, weight loss, or a family history of gastrointestinal cancer, your doctor may want you to have tests to rule out other possibilities. (During a colonoscopy, doctors use medication to sedate you, then insert a tube with a tiny camera into your rectum and your large intestine to see if it's healthy.) Getting relief from your IBS-D may take some detective work. You'll probably need to try several strategies and use many different techniques at a time. Possible treatments include: Diet changes: Foods and beverages don't cause IBS-D, but some may trigger your symptoms or make them worse. Alcohol, drinks with caffeine (like coffee and soda), carbonated drinks, chocolate, sorbitol (an artificial sweetener used in some gums and mints), fried food, and milk products may make IBS-related diarrhea worse. Fiber can be helpful for people who suffer from IBS with constipation (IBS-C). But if you have IBS-D, too much fiber can make your symptoms worse. You may need to experiment to figure out which types of whole grains, beans, fruits, and vegetables agree with your gut. Stress and related issues like anxiety and depression don't cause IBS. Massage, yoga, hypnotherapy, and forms of talk therapy can help with stress, which may lessen your symptoms. Over-the-counter medications:Anti-diarrhea medications like loperamide (Imodium) may help. Some experts believe probiotics (\"good\" bacteria, which you can get in supplement form or from foods like pickles and sauerkraut) can help relieve IBS symptoms, including diarrhea. Anticholinergic dicyclomine (Bentyl) slows bowel contractions that lead to diarrhea. Hyoscyamine (Levsin) acts in much the same way. Your doctor may suggest medicines like clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam (Ativan)to calm you down.They're usually only given for a short time since they have a higher risk of addiction. Alosetron hydrochloride (Lotronex) is specifically for women with IBS who are not having success with other treatments. It can help relieve stomach pain and diarrhea, but there are potentially serious side effects. Eluxadoline (Viberzi) may help reduce bowel contractions, belly cramps, and diarrhea. Rifaximin (Xifaxan) is an antibiotic you take for 2 weeks to treat diarrhea."]]
